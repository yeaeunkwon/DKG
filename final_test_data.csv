NPTX2, a member of the neuronal pentraxin family, is reported to play inconsistent roles in different cancers. The role and mechanism of NPTX2 in cSCC remain unclear. In this study, we found that NPTX2 was overexpressed in both skin lesions and cell lines of cSCC. In vitro studies showed that NPTX2 facilitated cell proliferation, migration, invasion, colony formation, and epithelial‒mesenchymal translation in A431 and SCL-1 cells. NPTX2 interacted with METTL3, increased METTL3 expression, and improved N6-methyladenosine modification in cSCC cell lines. Mechanistically, NPTX2 facilitated epithelial‒mesenchymal translation by promoting METTL3-mediated N6-methyladenosine of SNAIL. METTL3 knockdown and N6-methyladenosine inhibition reversed the impacts of NPTX2 overexpression on cSCC cells. In vivo studies verified the role of NPTX2 as an oncogene in cSCC. Therefore, NPTX2 may be a potential therapeutic target for cSCC.",en,1,22461306.74254589,19,"{'Biology': 58999, 'Medicine': 61100, 'Environmental science': 124972, 'Art': 49511, 'Sociology': 74713, 'Philosophy': 67848, 'History': 90185, 'Computer science': 47992, 'Geography': 51952, 'Political science': 41930, 'Psychology': 34987, 'Economics': 24324, 'Physics': 6144, 'Business': 32776, 'Engineering': 10210, 'Chemistry': 9604, 'Mathematics': 18763, 'Geology': 5933, 'Materials science': 3695}",1.0

Nematodes were identified and parasite assemblages of the four hosts were compared. Using only the number of nematodes identified to species as an indicator of diversity, the nematode community of P. bougainville was the most depauperate (4 species) followed by P. gunnii (11 species), P. pallescens (12 species) and P. nasuta (20 species). None of the species were found in all four hosts. Excluding P. bougainville, Sorensen’s index of similarity showed that P. gunnii and P. pallescens had the least similar, 0.26, and P. pallescens and P. nasuta the most similar, 0.50, nematode communities. Linstowinema warringtoni Smales, 1997, Mackerrastrongylus peramelis (Johnston & Mawson, 1938) and Peramelistrongylus skedastos Mawson, 1960 were found in three hosts, P. gunnii, P. nasuta and P. pallescens. Each of the four hosts had a unique species profile: four species of Physaloptera being found in P. nasuta, three in P. pallescens, one in P. gunnii and none in P. bougainville. Of the trichostrongyloids, Mackerrastrongylus peramelis was the most prevalent in P. pallescens and Peramelistrongylus skedastos in P. gunnii and P. nasuta.

https://openalex.org/W4385873751,2023,Biology,"Biofilm and Cancer: Interactions and Future Directions for Cancer TherapyThere is a growing body of evidence supporting the significant role of bacterial biofilms in the pathogenesis of various human diseases, including cancer. Biofilms are polymicrobial communities enclosed within an extracellular matrix composed of polysaccharides, proteins, extracellular DNA, and lipids. This complex matrix provides protection against antibiotics and host immune responses, enabling the microorganisms to establish persistent infections. Moreover, biofilms induce anti-inflammatory responses and metabolic changes in the host, further facilitating their survival. Many of these changes are comparable to those observed in cancer cells. This review will cover recent research on the role of bacterial biofilms in carcinogenesis, especially in colorectal (CRC) and gastric cancers, emphasizing the shared physical and chemical characteristics of biofilms and cancer. This review will also discuss the interactions between bacteria and the tumor microenvironment, which can facilitate oncogene expression and cancer progression. This information will provide insight into developing new therapies to identify and treat biofilm-associated cancers, such as utilizing bacteria as delivery vectors, using bacteria to upregulate immune function, or more selectively targeting biofilms and cancer for their shared traits.",en,1,29686092.70726149,19,"{'Chemistry': 26703, 'Economics': 26932, 'History': 79730, 'Medicine': 34881, 'Art': 66569, 'Environmental science': 85792, 'Biology': 69779, 'Philosophy': 76893, 'Sociology': 85415, 'Mathematics': 44300, 'Business': 45735, 'Geography': 54839, 'Computer science': 71289, 'Materials science': 7217, 'Psychology': 27526, 'Physics': 11412, 'Engineering': 19024, 'Political science': 49898, 'Geology': 1931}",1.0

Some substances are considered elicitors or stimulating agents because they promote seed germination as well as plant growth (like root and plumule length, and germination rate among others). Some of these, could be applied during plant growth, or in earlier phases before germination as seeds pretreatment. Neutral electrolyzed water (NEW) is a solution of oxidizing agents mainly studied for its antimicrobial power mainly applied to food pathogens, and in less reports to phytopathogens. The objective of this work is to evaluate the effect of NEW on germination and morphological parameters of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), cucumber (Cucumis sativus) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) seeds as well as to evaluate the in vitro activity of NEW against F. oxysporum. Two experiments were carried out to determine the in vitro and in vivo effects of NEW in seed pretreatment and another in vitro experiment was also carried out to determine antifungal effect against F. oxysporum. NEW in vitro treatments at 50 mg/L decreased spore concentration greater than 4 log spores/mL. Germination parameters and morphological variables were analyzed after NEW pretreatments. For in vitro germination, NEW pretreatments up to 75 mg/L did not show effect on germination parameters however highest dose was slightly adverse (4% against water control). For in vivo germination, NEW pretreatment of 100 mg/L had a stimulating effect on the germination rate in cucumber seeds (100% FGP against 83% FGP for water control). For tomato seeds germination neither stimulate nor adverse effect was observed (same percentage as water control). For lettuce seeds germination an inhibitory effect for 12 and 24 h of exposure time was achieved (73% NEW treatment against 90% of water control). For tomato and lettuce seeds, the NEW pretreatment of 50 mg/L during 12 h increased its germination capacity.",en,1,0.0,0,{},0.0

The function and mechanism of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HSCC) have not been fully elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the role of a specific lncRNA, linc01224, in regulating the miR-485-5p/IGF2BP3 axis in HSCC. We confirmed the lncRNA expression profiles in 5 pairs of HSCC and normal tissues by lncRNA sequencing. Another 28 HSCC tissues were further validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). qRT-PCR was also used to detect the expression levels of linc01224, miR-485-5p and IGF2BP3 in HSCC cell lines. Next, functional experiments in vitro and in vivo were applied to determine the effects of linc01224 silencing on tumor proliferation, migration, apoptosis and progression in HSCC. Linc01224 expression was significantly higher in HSCC tissues than in adjacent normal tissues. In addition, HSCC patients with low IGF2BP3 expression had good survival. In vitro assays were mechanistically performed to explore whether linc01224 positively regulates IGF2BP3 expression via its competitive inhibition of miR-485-5p. An in vivo animal model also confirmed that linc01224 could promote the occurrence and development of HSCC. Our study first identified that linc01224 plays an oncogenic role in HSCC. It suggests that linc01224 may act as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for HSCC.",en,1,21778.18336798737,3,"{'Biology': 21712, 'Chemistry': 418, 'Medicine': 532}",1.0

https://openalex.org/W4387737066,2023,Biology,"Anti-inflammatory effects of cold atmospheric plasma irradiation on the THP-1 human acute monocytic leukemia cell lineCold atmospheric plasma (CAP) has been studied and clinically applied to treat chronic wounds, cancer, periodontitis, and other diseases. CAP exerts cytotoxic, bactericidal, cell-proliferative, and anti-inflammatory effects on living tissues by generating reactive species. Therefore, CAP holds promise as a treatment for diseases involving chronic inflammation and bacterial infections. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying these anti-inflammatory effects of CAP are still unclear. Thus, this study aimed to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of CAP in vitro. The human acute monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1, was stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and irradiated with CAP, and the cytotoxic effects of CAP were evaluated. Time-course differentiation of gene expression was analyzed, and key transcription factors were identified via transcriptome analysis. Additionally, the nuclear localization of the CAP-induced transcription factor was examined using western blotting. The results indicated that CAP showed no cytotoxic effects after less than 70 s of irradiation and significantly inhibited interleukin 6 (IL6) expression after more than 40 s of irradiation. Transcriptome analysis revealed many differentially expressed genes (DEGs) following CAP irradiation at all time points. Cluster analysis classified the DEGs into four distinct groups, each with time-dependent characteristics. Gene ontology and gene set enrichment analyses revealed CAP-induced suppression of IL6 production, other inflammatory responses, and the expression of genes related to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II. Transcription factor analysis suggested that nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), which suppresses intracellular oxidative stress, is the most activated transcription factor. Contrarily, regulatory factor X5, which regulates MHC class II expression, is the most suppressed transcription factor. Western blotting revealed the nuclear localization of NRF2 following CAP irradiation. These data suggest that CAP suppresses the inflammatory response, possibly by promoting NRF2 nuclear translocation.",en,1,0.0,0,{},0.0

Even if the response to multiple xenobiotic exposure is well known at the host level, the role of the mussel-associated microbiome in the animal response to environmental pollution is poorly explored, despite its potential in xenobiotic detoxification and its important role in host development, protection, and adaptation. Here, we characterized the microbiome-host integrative response of M. galloprovincialis in a real-world setting, involving exposure to a complex pattern of emerging pollutants, as occurs in the Northwestern Adriatic Sea. A total of 387 mussel individuals from 3 commercial farms, spanning about 200 km along the Northwestern Adriatic coast, and in 3 different seasons, were collected. Multiresidue analysis (for quantitative xenobiotic determination), transcriptomics (for host physiological response), and metagenomics (for host-associated microbial taxonomical and functional features) analyses were performed on the digestive glands. According to our findings, M. galloprovincialis responds to the presence of the complex pattern of multiple emerging pollutants - including the antibiotics sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, and tetracycline, the herbicides atrazine and metolachlor, and the insecticide N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide - integrating host defense mechanisms, e.g., through upregulation of transcripts involved in animal metabolic activity, and microbiome-mediated detoxification functions, including microbial functionalities involved in multidrug or tetracycline resistance. Overall, our data highlight the importance of the mussel-associated microbiome as a strategic player for the orchestration of resistance to the multixenobiotic exposure at the holobiont level, providing strategic functionalities for the detoxification of multiple xenobiotic substances, as occurring in real world exposure settings. Complementing the host with microbiome-dependent xenobiotic degradative and resistance genes, the M. galloprovincialis digestive gland associated microbiome can have an important role in the detoxification of emerging pollutants in a context of high anthropogenic pressure, supporting the relevance of mussel systems as potential animal-based bioremediation tool.",en,1,92163.59561591552,9,"{'Biology': 14286, 'Environmental science': 4218, 'Chemistry': 4446, 'Sociology': 589, 'Philosophy': 512, 'Geology': 19, 'Psychology': 19, 'Geography': 8, 'Political science': 19}",1.0

We have found reproducibly 22 genes/open reading frames (ORF), which when deleted, confer resistance to cisplatin at a concentration that is lethal to wild-type cells. Complementation of individual deletion strains with the corresponding wild-type gene abolished cisplatin resistance, confirming that specific gene deletions caused the resistance. Twenty of the genes/ORFs identified have not been previously linked to cisplatin resistance and belong to several distinct functional groups. Major functional groups encode proteins involved in nucleotide metabolism, mRNA catabolism, RNA-polymerase-II–dependent gene regulation and vacuolar transport systems. In addition, proteins that function in ubiquitination, sphingolipid biogenesis, cyclic AMP–dependent signaling, DNA repair, and genome stability are also associated with cisplatin resistance. More than half of the identified genes are known to have sequences or functional homology to mammalian counterparts.

Soybean meal and lucerne hay were used as control. The total gas production ranged from 12.8 mL/g in P. pterocarpum to 127.3 mL/g in soybean meal. The total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration from G. sepium (117.7 mM/L) and V. sutherlandii (111.3 mM/L) were larger than other legumes except for soybean meal (157.1 mM/L) and lucerne hay (130.4 mM/L), P < 0.001.

The V. sutherlandii (720 g/kg crude protein (CP)) and G. sepium (745 g/kg CP) had the greatest effective CP degradation (EPD) than other legume species examined, P < 0.001, which was approaching that measured in the control samples. The amount of protein fraction ‘a’ (rapidly degradable) was larger in JCU9 (551 g/kg CP), and G. sepium (472 g/kg CP), and lower in B. hookeri (10.9 g/kg CP) and P. pterocarpum (14.8 g/kg CP), P < 0.001.

The Desmanthus cultivars showed intermediate values among the tested legumes in fermentation characteristics and shows potential to provide slowly degradable protein while reducing methane. The findings indicate the possibility of using V. sutherlandii and G. sepium to substitute other forages for their greater slowly degradable protein content.

https://openalex.org/W4367174395,2023,Biology,"Maize phytocytokines modulate pro-survival host responses and pathogen resistancePhytocytokines are signaling peptides that alert plant cells of danger. However, the downstream responses triggered by phytocytokines and their effect on plant survival are still largely unknown. Here, we have identified three biologically active maize orthologues of phytocytokines previously described in other plants. The maize phytocytokines show common features with microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), including the induction of immune-related genes and activation of papain-like cysteine proteases. In contrast to MAMPs, phytocytokines do not promote cell death in the presence of wounding. In infection assays with two fungal pathogens, we found that phytocytokines affect the development of disease symptoms, likely due to the activation of phytohormonal pathways. Collectively, our results show that phytocytokines and MAMPs trigger unique and antagonistic features of immunity. We propose a model in which phytocytokines activate immune responses partially similar to MAMPs but, in contrast to microbial signals, they act as danger and survival molecules to the surrounding cells. Future studies will focus on the components determining the divergence of signaling outputs upon phytocytokine activation. [Formula: see text] Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

https://openalex.org/W4315700849,2023,Biology,"The Time MachineI'm 70 this year. Can you believe it? 70! Seems like only yesterday I first met Aden. I knew we were made for each other the moment our arms locked. Our matchmakers should get credit for that.Aden's going to be 70 this year too. We were born in the same month in the Cavendish workshop, Cambridge. From there we migrated, together with other newborns, to the office of James Watson and Francis Crick, who paired us up. We looked magnificent lined up in double-helical formation with the other couples. Visitors were ushered in to admire our spiral pose. They gawped while congratulating our matchmakers on their intellectual tour-de-force, for as Watson and Crick were to write in their classic paper, their structure ‘rests mainly though not entirely on published experimental data and stereo-chemical arguments’.I was nine when our matchmakers were awarded the Nobel Prize. That year we moved to a newly constructed laboratory, the Laboratory of Molecular Biology, on the outskirts of Cambridge. We were housed in the communal model room. People lost interest over the years and we grew a thick skin of dust. Some of our companions began to drop away. Finally, I was torn from Aden as the coils were dismantled. Aged 15, Aden and I found ourselves packed up in a box of spare parts and sent off with crystallographer Herman Watson to Bristol.In the same year, 1968, James Watson published The Double Helix, which told the story of how I came into being. It seems that before I was born, he and Crick had proposed a triple helical formation, with a backbone on the inside. Euphoric, they had informed their colleagues, including their boss, Sir Laurence Bragg, that the elusive DNA structure had been solved. But when Rosalind Franklin, who Watson considered obstructive and narrow-minded, saw their proposed arrangement, she was quick to point out it couldn't possibly be correct – too little water. An unpublished X-ray picture from Franklin's student, Raymond Gosling, set them on the right path.A few years after publication of The Double Helix, I was reunited with Aden. Ann Newmark from the London Science Museum discovered us, along with other survivors of our birth group, when visiting Herman Watson in Bristol. A plan was hatched for a reunion. We were to be reassembled and exhibited in the museum, to help to transport museum visitors back to those first moments of discovery. In 1977, aged 24, our reconstruction cast its shadow of spidery hexagons and pentagons once more. We've been assisting with time travel ever since.I must admit I've become a little obsessed about my past. Occasionally new insights surface. Ten years ago, Raymond Gosling, the student who took the X-ray picture, was interviewed. He said how Franklin positively relished pointing out the errors in Watson and Crick's first structure, the triple helix. Gosling's interviewer suggested that Watson's negative portrayal of Franklin could have been payback for this moment. ‘Yes’, said Gosling. ‘Oh, I'd never thought of it, but yes, that's true. The humiliation. He must have felt – that's the word – he must have felt humiliated. Who the hell is this woman, telling me…Yes, you can see it more clearly looking back, can't you?’.Aden wasn't surprised by Gosling's words: “I always suspected Watson was angry with Franklin for puncturing his pride”.“What made you think that?”, I asked.“In his book he wrote how, a few months before we were born, Linus Pauling, who he considered ‘unquestionably the world's most astute chemist’, proposed a triple helical structure for DNA. He wrote of Pauling's error: ‘if a student had made a similar mistake, he would be thought unfit to benefit from Cal Tech's chemistry faculty’. He was as derisory of Pauling's triple helix as he must have felt Franklin had been of his. Belittling an intellectual giant made his own mistake more excusable. And remember how Watson described Franklin's reaction when she first heard about our double helical form: ‘Rosy's instant acceptance of our model at first amazed me…her fierce annoyance with Francis and me collapsed…Obviously affecting Rosy's transformation was her appreciation that our past hooting about model building represented a serious approach to science, not the easy retort of slackers who wanted to avoid the hard work necessitated by an honest scientific career’. Makes you wonder whether it wasn't she who'd been angry with him, but he who'd been angry with her.”“I don't get it”, I said. “Shouldn't we welcome being put right; thank those who correct us? I'm more than happy to accept criticism.”“Of course, dear.”“And if Watson was so concerned about looking clever, why did he write a book contradicting himself? By revealing the vital part the X-ray photo played, he undermined his earlier claim that unpublished data played only a minor role in the discovery.”“Maybe he didn't see the contradiction. Believing Franklin to be aggressive and blinkered may have allowed him to feel justified in minimising the importance of her data in his publication with Crick. She died before his book came out, so she never knew how crucial her and Gosling's contribution had been.”Aden and I now live surrounded by retired metallics: a V2 Rocket, a stack of popular cars topped by a Fiat 600, a JET1 gas turbine car and a Rolls-Royce Merlin engine that once powered Spitfire aircraft. And hovering above us, like a colossal bird of prey poised to swoop, the Lockheed Electra, the plane Neville Chamberlain took to negotiate peace with Hitler.The time-travellers are about to be let in. I do hope they'll be kind. Not like that traveller from a few days ago who was keen to point out an error in our helical formation to his companion: some of our couples should be holding each other with three arms not two.“What a jerk!”, I said to Aden, after the traveller left.“But he's right.

Thus, we compared the effects of pea protein alone vs. pea protein + BFX on microbiome changes and plasma levels of EAAs. Methods: A placebo-controlled crossover clinical study in active men (n=40) was performed during which quantification of abundance levels of gut bacterial and fungal (bacteriome and mycobiome) organisms were assessed. In addition, plasma EAAs were measured pre- and post- ingestion of the pea protein +/-BFX for 180 min. Stool samples were analyzed for changes in microbiome composition from baseline and compared for PP versus PP+BFX. Self-reported changes in gastrointestinal (e.g., bloating, flatulence) and quality of life (e.g., fatigue, mood, and energy) indices were also measured. Results: Participants ingesting PP + BFX exhibited a distinct microbiome profile compared to baseline and ingestion of PP. Differences in plasma EAAs showed a trend for an interaction (P=0.097) and post hoc testing at 120 min showed a significant difference (P=0.047) between PP and PP+BFX. Microbiome analysis of stool samples showed that the pathogens Escherichia coli, Prevotella copri, Shigella flexneri, and Brevundimonas diminuta were lower in PP+BFX compared to PP. The abundance of Candida albicans was lower and the level of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was higher in PP+BFX compared to PP. Interestingly, the abundance of Pseudomonas species, cyanobacteria phyla and the fungal species Galactomyces geotrichum were elevated when the combination of PP+BFX were consumed by study subjects (P&lt;0.05). Other than main effects of time there were no significant differences between treatments in self-reported gastrointestinal (GI) and well-being markers. Conclusion: Our results indicate that the addition of BFX to PP alters the gut microbiome composition, aiding in the absorption of dietary non-animal proteins and increasing essential amino acid appearance in plasma.",en,1,116096.4197065338,13,"{'Chemistry': 17865, 'Medicine': 3781, 'Environmental science': 3781, 'Engineering': 306, 'Business': 285, 'Philosophy': 608, 'Economics': 51, 'Materials science': 38, 'Biology': 19, 'Geography': 55, 'Sociology': 38, 'History': 38, 'Psychology': 19}",1.0

While eDNA (environmental deoxyribonucleic acid)-based method has emerged as a valuable tool for understanding these issues, its application in assessing phylogenetic diversity, community stability, and the identification of key species within river systems has been limited. In this study, we conducted eDNA metabarcoding to assess fish community phylogenetic diversity, species composition, assembly variations, and their relationship with hydrologic characteristics. We also explored ecological stability and the roles of key species in a river system comprising a mainstem (MS) and a tributary (TB) with distinct hydrologic features. Our findings uncovered previously unknown endemic fish species diversity, exemplified by the discovery of Triplophysa. We identified disparities in diversity, community composition, and assembly between the MS and TB. Furthermore, we established significant associations between water-level variations, water flow, and changes in community composition. Triplophysa, with its high diversity, played a pivotal role in the ecological network, contributing significantly to community stability. The loss of Triplophysa increased fragility in co-occurrence patterns. Comparing the ecological network of fish communities between the MS and TB, we found that the MS displayed greater robustness and lower vulnerability, with increased species competition likely promoting network stability. Overall, this study highlights the potential of integrating eDNA metabarcoding data for monitoring phylogenetic diversity, community structure, and variations in stability within fish communities.",en,1,0.0,0,{},0.0

Here, we report 2 unrelated patients who present with an autosomal dominant ZSD.We performed biochemical and genetic studies in blood and skin fibroblasts of the patients and demonstrated the pathogenicity of the identified PEX14 variants by functional cell studies.We identified 2 different single heterozygous de novo variants in the PEX14 genes of 2 patients diagnosed with ZSD. Both variants cause messenger RNA mis-splicing, leading to stable expression of similar C-terminally truncated PEX14 proteins. Functional studies indicated that the truncated PEX14 proteins lost their function in peroxisomal matrix protein import and cause increased degradation of peroxisomes, ie, pexophagy, thus exerting a dominant-negative effect on peroxisome functioning. Inhibition of pexophagy by different autophagy inhibitors or genetic knockdown of the peroxisomal autophagy receptor NBR1 resulted in restoration of peroxisomal functions in the patients' fibroblasts.Our finding of an autosomal dominant ZSD expands the genetic repertoire of ZSDs.

In recent years it has been increased evidence that plant microbiome is closely linked to plant physiology. We hypothesize that E. platyacanthus responds to environmental changes by altering its physiology, which modifies the bacterial communities in its rhizosphere, especially the abundance of plant growth-promoting bacteria. Physiological changes associated with adult individuals of E. platyacanthus during the rainy and dry seasons were analyzed [chlorophyll fluorescence, photosynthetic pigments, nocturnal acidity, water potential, reactive oxygen species, and root exudates (amino acids)]. Rhizosphere samples were taken to determine the soil's physicochemical properties and bacterial communities. During the dry season, E. platyacanthus makes significant physiological adjustments to respond to the decrease in soil water and nutrient availability, mainly increasing chlorophyll b and carotenoids. The physiological regulation cascade modifies the profile of amino acids exuded by its roots. In turn, the rhizosphere bacterial community changed. Beneficial bacteria to the plant from the phylum Armatimonadota, classes Actinobacteria and Dehalococcoidia, and families Gemmataceae and Nitrosococcaceae, were more abundant in the dry season. Based on a regularized generalized canonical correlation analysis, we showed a model to explain how E. platyacanthus tolerance to the dry season could be conferred by an interaction between its physiological regulatory mechanisms and the symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria mediated through root exudation. Furthermore, this work is the first description of the amino acids exuded by cacti that stimulate the increase in the populations of beneficial bacteria in the rhizosphere.",en,1,5223496.893246016,19,"{'Biology': 28348, 'Sociology': 45330, 'Philosophy': 32284, 'Environmental science': 16401, 'Geology': 3888, 'Psychology': 7176, 'Geography': 15660, 'Political science': 13968, 'Chemistry': 5529, 'History': 27717, 'Mathematics': 1673, 'Art': 15853, 'Economics': 3849, 'Computer science': 12136, 'Medicine': 2489, 'Business': 5725, 'Materials science': 1232, 'Engineering': 2363, 'Physics': 684}",1.0

However, a comprehensive understanding of MYC2 regulatory role in fruit development and ripening is still lacking. In this study, the integrative and comparative analysis was performed on the transcriptome and metabolome of wild-type (WT) and SlMYC2 knockout tomato fruit at mature green and red ripening stages to uncover the function of SlMYC2. A total of 764 metabolites and 30,280 annotated unigenes were identified. The differential accumulated metabolites (DAMs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) caused by SlMYC2 mutation were 32.3 % and 159.8 % higher in red ripening fruit than in mature green fruit, respectively. From the mature green to red ripening stages of tomato fruit, KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that the DEGs affected by SlMYC2 were primarily involved in photosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, phenylpropanoid pathway, carotenoid biosynthesis, and plant hormone signal transduction. In addition, there are 36 TFs families in these DEGs, mainly including MYB_related, MYB, bHLH, B3, ERF, NAC, HB-other, WRKY and bZIP. Furthermore, the co-expression and promoter analysis indicated that MYB44, PLA1, WRKY17, LOX2, PPA1-LIKE, JAZ, ACSL1 and PYL4 may play an important role in the aforementioned metabolic pathways regulated by SlMYC2. Overall, these findings indicate that many key metabolic pathways, transcription factors, and genes may be governed by SlMYC2, potentially being related to fruit development, ripening, quality and stress resistance mechanisms.

Accumulating evidence suggests age-related changes in the sperm epigenome as one underlying mechanism. Using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing on 73 sperm samples of males attending a fertility center, we identified 1,162 (74%) regions which were significantly (FDR-adjusted) hypomethylated and 403 regions (26%) being hypermethylated with age. There were no significant correlations with paternal BMI, semen quality, or ART outcome. The majority (1,152 of 1,565; 74%) of age-related differentially methylated regions (ageDMRs) were located within genic regions, including 1,002 genes with symbols. Hypomethylated ageDMRs were closer to transcription start sites than hypermethylated DMRs, half of which reside in gene-distal regions. In this and conceptually related genome-wide studies, so far 2,355 genes have been reported with significant sperm ageDMRs, however most (90%) of them in only one study. The 241 genes which have been replicated at least once showed significant functional enrichments in 41 biological processes associated with development and the nervous system and in 10 cellular components associated with synapses and neurons. This supports the hypothesis that paternal age effects on the sperm methylome affect offspring behaviour and neurodevelopment. It is interesting to note that sperm ageDMRs were not randomly distributed throughout the human genome; chromosome 19 showed a highly significant twofold enrichment with sperm ageDMRs.

These challenges may be overcome with off-the-shelf allogeneic CAR T cells derived from healthy donor T cells. Although allogeneic CAR T cells provide immediate availability to patients and the convenience of scalable manufacturing, they may be susceptible to immune rejection and may therefore have reduced persistence, limiting clinical responses. Immune evasion strategies centered on deletion of β2-microglobulin may avoid rejection by CD8 T cells but may elicit strong NK cell reactivity. Moreover, induction of HLA class II expression upon CAR T cell activation may increase the risk of rejection by CD4 T cells. We previously showed that inactivation of RFX5, a transcriptional regulator of HLA class I/II genes, resulted in effective resistance to T cell rejection and induced low NK cell reactivity. Here, we describe an additional anti-rejection strategy by inactivating CD58 and ICAM-1, key components of the immune synapse required for effective recognition and lysis by alloreactive T/NK cells. Knockout of either gene in allogeneic CAR T cells reduced alloreactivity and gave greater survival benefit in combination with RFX5 KO. <h3>Methods</h3> CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used to knock out RFX5, B2M, CD58, ICAM-1 and/or TRAC. Survival of gene-edited CAR T cells in the presence of HLA-mismatched allogeneic T cells and NK cells was assessed in mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assays. CAR T cell cytotoxicity was assessed in a serial stimulation assay. <h3>Results</h3> CAR T cells with targeted deletion of RFX5, CD58 and ICAM-1 demonstrated enhanced survival, whereas unmodified CAR T cells were quickly eliminated by HLA-mismatched T cells (p&lt;0.0001). Combination of CD58 KO with RFX5 KO potentiated evasion in MLR assays (p&lt;0.0001), whereas unmodified control and B2M KO cells were eliminated by allogeneic T cells and NK cells, respectively. Expression of HLA molecules was unaffected in CD58 KO and ICAM-1 KO CAR T cells and as a result, allogeneic NK cell reactivity was not elicited. Importantly, inactivation of CD58 or ICAM-1 did not affect cytotoxic activity or elicit IL-2 independent CAR T cell expansion. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Targeted deletion of CD58 or ICAM-1 effectively reduces T cell rejection of allogeneic CAR T cells without triggering NK cell rejection or impacting effector function and works additively with RFX5 KO. Off-the-shelf immune-evasive CAR T cells have the potential to resist rejection and achieve improved therapeutic responses.",en,1,3600872.079688253,19,"{'Biology': 56035, 'Medicine': 40274, 'Philosophy': 16018, 'Environmental science': 18105, 'Art': 13563, 'Mathematics': 8239, 'Sociology': 10077, 'History': 14177, 'Computer science': 11383, 'Geography': 4725, 'Political science': 7039, 'Economics': 2501, 'Engineering': 1628, 'Business': 3989, 'Psychology': 4022, 'Physics': 2238, 'Chemistry': 1402, 'Geology': 201, 'Materials science': 228}",1.0

Their radial-oriented processes span the width of the retina and respond to injury through a cellular response that can be detrimental or protective depending on the context. In some species, protective responses include the expression of stem cell-like genes which help to fuel new neuron formation and even restoration of vision. In many lower vertebrates including fish and amphibians, this response is well documented, however, in mammals it is severely limited. The remarkable plasticity of cellular reprogramming in lower vertebrates has inspired studies in mammals for repairing the retina and restoring sight, and recent studies suggest that mammals are also capable of regeneration, albeit to a lesser degree.

Evolution led to a wide range of adaptations in behaviors, morphology and ecological traits. Many plants rely on specialized bee species for pollination events, and so this interdependence can make them increasingly vulnerable to ongoing threats of habitat loss and pesticide exposure. Studying the genomes of bee species across different life histories and ecological specializations can help understand the evolution of these traits more generally, but also inform conservation efforts for Camptopoeum friesei specifically. Here, we present the reference genome of the solitary bee Camptopoeum friesei (Arthropoda; Insecta; Hymenoptera; Andrenidae). C. friesei is highly dependent on steppe habitats where it nests in saline soils. Further, it is highly specialized (oligolectic) on a few Asteraceae: Centaurea and Cirsium , in particular on Centaurea stoebe . As a consequence of its high specialization level, it is of its ecological niche with an extremely scattered and rare habitat, C. friesei is highly threatened in central Europe, albeit local aggregations can be rich in individuals. The high-quality genome assembly for the colourful bee Camptopoeum friesei was generated using long-read PacBio HiFi in combination with chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) sequencing. The genome spans 367.7 megabases (Mb), N50 of 25.2 Mb. The majority of the assembly is scaffolded into 10 chromosomes and harbours ∼40% repeats.

This study aimed to investigate the functional role of the transcription factor SmMYB39 in salt stress tolerance in eggplant. This investigation was conducted through the utilization of bioinformatics analysis, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), subcellular localization, validation of transcriptional activation activity, Virus-Induced Gene Silencing (VIGS), and protein interactome analysis. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that SmMYB39 has the closest relationship with SlMYB41, and its promoter contains multiple stress-responsive elements. qRT-PCR results demonstrated that SmMYB39 was significantly upregulated after 12 h of salt stress. Subcellular localization results indicated that the SmMYB39 protein is localized in the nucleus and exhibits transcriptional activation activity. Using VIGS, we observed that silencing of SmMYB39 led to reduced salt stress tolerance in eggplant. In addition, we have conducted research on the protein interactome of SmMYB39. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that SmMYB39 is a crucial transcription factor involved in salt stress response and has the potential to enhance salt tolerance in eggplant.",en,1,29695739.031498805,19,"{'Biology': 106732, 'Medicine': 38988, 'History': 86007, 'Psychology': 35646, 'Philosophy': 82467, 'Art': 70378, 'Sociology': 91197, 'Environmental science': 93409, 'Computer science': 68438, 'Political science': 57468, 'Physics': 13480, 'Mathematics': 40283, 'Geography': 51492, 'Chemistry': 11636, 'Economics': 26542, 'Business': 39372, 'Engineering': 21744, 'Materials science': 10433, 'Geology': 2063}",1.0

Here, we report a high‐quality chromosome‐level assembly of the S. rosmarinus genome of 1.11 Gb in size; the genome has a scaffold N50 value of 95.5 Mb and contains 40 701 protein‐coding genes. In contrast to other diploid Labiataceae, an independent whole‐genome duplication event occurred in S. rosmarinus at approximately 15 million years ago. Transcriptomic comparison of two S. rosmarinus cultivars with contrasting carnosic acid (CA) content revealed 842 genes significantly positively associated with CA biosynthesis in S. rosmarinus . Many of these genes have been reported to be involved in CA biosynthesis previously, such as genes involved in the mevalonate/methylerythritol phosphate pathways and CYP71‐coding genes. Based on the genomes and these genes, we propose a model of CA biosynthesis in S. rosmarinus . Further, comparative genome analysis of the congeneric species revealed the species‐specific evolution of CA biosynthesis genes. The genes encoding diterpene synthase and the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) family of CA synthesis‐associated genes form a biosynthetic gene cluster ( CPSs – KSLs – CYP76AHs ) responsible for the synthesis of leaf and root diterpenoids, which are located on S. rosmarinus chromosomes 1 and 2, respectively. Such clustering is also observed in other sage ( Salvia ) plants, thus suggesting that genes involved in diterpenoid synthesis are conserved in the Labiataceae family.

The systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following the PRISMA statement and Review Manager was used for meta-analysis. Outcomes were calculated using the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous data. For dichotomous outcomes, effect sizes were estimated by calculating pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI. Statistical heterogeneity was estimated by the I2 statistic. Compared with placebo, buprenorphine prolonged the duration of analgesia by an average of 8 hours (MD, 8.01; 95% CI, 6.79 to 9.24; P < .00001).

This systematic review aims to summarize the outcomes of chronic ATR treated using either a gastrocnemius aponeurosis flap or semitendinosus tendon graft. Methods : A systematic search was conducted in three databases (PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane), for studies describing outcomes after surgical treatment of chronic ATR using gastrocnemius aponeurosis flaps or semitendinosus tendon grafts with more than 10 patients included. The studies were assessed for quality and risk of bias using the Methodological Items used to assess risk of bias in Non-Randomized studies (MINORS). Results : Out of the 818 studies identified with the initial search, a total of 36 studies with 763 individual patients were included in this systematic review. Gastrocnemius aponeurosis flap was used in 21 and semitendinosus tendon graft was used in 13 of the studies. The mean (SD) postoperative Achilles tendon Total Rupture Score (ATRS) for patients treated with a gastrocnemius aponeurosis flap was 83 (14) points and the mean (SD) American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS) was 96 (1.7) points compared with ATRS 88 (6.9) points and AOFAS 92 (5.6) points for patients treated with a semitendinosus tendon graft. The included studies generally had low-quality according to MINORS, with a median of 8 (range 2-13) for all studies. Conclusion: Both gastrocnemius aponeurosis flaps and semitendinosus tendon grafts give acceptable results with minimal complications and are valid methods for treating chronic ATR. The main difference is more wound healing complications in patients treated with a gastrocnemius aponeurosis flap and more sural nerve injuries in patients treated with a semitendinosus grafts. The current literature on the subject is of mainly low quality and the absence of a patient-related outcome measure validated for chronic ATR makes comparisons between studies difficult.

Recent studies have proposed that reservoirs placed via an abdominal counterincision (CI) may offer more precise and durable positioning as compared with a transinguinal (TI) approach. Aim Herein we compare the CI-HSM and TI-HSM techniques with respect to operative time, pain control, and postoperative complications. Methods We reviewed our penile prosthesis database at a large single-surgeon tertiary referral center from 2014 to 2021 to compare those who underwent virgin reservoir placement via the CI-HSM technique vs the TI-HSM technique. Statistical analysis was performed with the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables and the chi-square test and Fisher exact test for discrete variables. Outcomes Operative time, postoperative complications, morphine milligram equivalents prescribed, and postoperative correspondence were compared between patients undergoing the CI-HSM and TI-HSM techniques. Results Among 456 virgin IPP implants, the CI-HSM technique was used in 34 cases (7.5%) and the TI-HSM technique in 422 cases (92.5%). Of these 456 cases, 92 (20.2%) were combined with ancillary procedures such as artificial urinary sphincter, urethral sling, or penile plication (6/34, CI; 86/422, TI). Cases employing the CI-HSM technique had a 19.9% greater median operative time: 81.5 minutes (IQR, 69.3-106.5) vs 68 minutes (IQR, 57.8-80.3; P &amp;lt; .01). A similar proportion of patients in the CI-HSM group (2/34, 5.9%) were treated for infection as in the TI-HSM group (17/422, 4.0%; P = .64). Reservoir herniation was seen in 12 patients in the TI-HSM group (2.8%) and in none of the CI-HSM group, but this did not reach significance (P &amp;gt; .99). No differences were identified between patients in the TI-HSM and CI-HSM groups with regard to postoperative morphine milligram equivalents prescribed, narcotic medication refills, or postoperative correspondence. Clinical Implications CI-HSM reservoir placement was associated with similar surgical outcomes to TI-HSM without increased infection risk or need for narcotic pain management. Strengths and Limitations Although this study is a large contemporary series addressing a clinically important subject, it is limited by its retrospective preliminary nature and nonrandomized unmatched design. Patient pain regimens were assessed via discharge prescriptions, although data regarding narcotic consumption were not available in the medical record. Conclusions IPP reservoir placement via the CI-HSM technique is safe and well tolerated. Increased operative time of the CI-HSM technique as compared with the TI-HSM technique is clinically negligible given its potential safety benefits of direct visualization of reservoir placement.",en,1,0.0,0,{},0.0

Alterations of biomarkers levels during treatment are important in evaluating treatment efficacy and predicting outcomes in sepsis. This meta-analysis investigated the relationship between changes in cytokine levels after treatment compared with those on hospital admission, and their relationship with the prognosis of patients with sepsis.From conception until August 4, 2021, a complete literature search of the PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library electronic databases was done. Observational studies where the outcomes of sepsis patients were divided into non-survivors and survivors and which reported cytokine levels at least before treatment in ICU were included in the current study. Standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) values from individual studies were pooled using a random-effects model. Quality assessment, subgroup analysis, publication bias, and sensitivity analyses were all carried out.A total of 2570 patients with sepsis from 25 eligible studies were included, and 14 of them measured the cytokine levels before and after treatment in ICU. Among IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-10 levels, those of IL-6 were significantly lower after treatment in ICU than at baseline in patients with sepsis in the survival group (SMD = -0.69, P < 0.0001), but were comparable in the non-survival group (SMD = -0.99, P = 0.0575). Similarly, post-treatment TNF-α levels were significantly lower than those at baseline only in patients with sepsis in the survival group (SMD = -0.44, P < 0.0001), but not in the non-survival group (SMD =-0.17, P = 0.0842).This meta-analysis shows that reduced IL-6 and TNF-α levels after sepsis treatment in ICU may be indicators of better prognosis and survival of patients with sepsis.",en,1,0.0,1,{'Medicine': 8322},0.0

Background Sacubitril/Valsartan therapy has become a cornerstone of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) pharmacological therapy due to its positive prognostic impact. However, conflicting results have emerged on the effects of sacubitril/valsartan on exercise performance assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). Purpose The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the effects of sacubitril/valsartan on prognostically significant CPET parameters in a larger population of HFrEF patients at different drug doses. Methods We prospectively enrolled HFrEF outpatients eligible to start sacubitril/valsartan according to 2016 ESC Guidelines in 3 Heart Failure Units. Patients underwent CPET at baseline (before sacubitril/valsartan treatment), after 1, 2, 3 months (respectively after a month taking the 24/26 – 49/51 – 97/103mg doses), and 6 months after the maximum tolerated dose was reached (end-study). The subjective impression of disease-related limitation was assessed using the 12-item Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ). Results 113 patients were enrolled (age 64.5±9.7, 81% males) (Table 1). Peak oxygen intake (peakVO2) improved at each step from 15.0±4.5 mL/min/kg at baseline to 16.5±4.9 mL/min/kg at end study visit, corresponding to 61.5±16.0 and 67.9±17.4 % of predicted, respectively (p&amp;lt;0.05). Minute ventilation/carbon dioxide production relationship (VE/VCO2 slope) reduced from 39.6±5.5 to 35.9±7.1 (p = 0.005) in the 39 patients (42%) with pathological VE/VCO2≥34 at baseline. KCCQ improved significantly since the first visit with an overall summary score increase from 47.9±11.1 to 52.6±9.8 (p&amp;lt;0.001). Conclusions These findings suggest that sacubitril/valsartan benefits on exercise capacity are immediately evident at the lowest dose and progressively improve as the dose increases.",en,1,0.0,0,{},0.0

This cross-sectional study aimed to develop a culturally sensitive Chronic Pain Cognition Scale (CPCS) for Chinese-/Chinese dialect-speaking populations and investigate its psychometric properties.Adult patients with chronic low back pain or chronic neck pain who visited pain clinics at a medical center in northern Taiwan were enrolled. Participants completed the demographic, intensity of pain, and two other related sensations, ""Sng ()"" and ""Ma ()"", often reported in Chinese-speaking populations, CPCS, Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire-8, and Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire.200 patients were included. Patients' mean age was 64.84 ± 14.33, 126 (63.0%) were female, and 83 (41.5%) had 13+ years of education. The average duration of pain was 77.25 ± 97.46 months, the intensity of pain was 6.04 ± 2.50, Ma was 3.43 ± 3.24, and Sng was 4.54 ± 3.14. The CPCS comprised four factors: pain impact (how pain impact one's life), losing face (how one being disrespected due to pain), helplessness, and avoidance, with good structural validity and adequate reliability (Cronbach α, 0.60-0.81) and satisfactory criterion-related validity. Moreover, losing face, an essential concept in Chinese relationalism, was significantly related to pain, Sng, and Ma (r = 0.19, 0.15 and 0.16), but not to pain acceptance or self-efficacy, indicating a culturally specific element in pain measurement.The CPCS has good psychometric properties and is suitable for evaluating chronic pain in the clinical setting, and might be generalizable to other Chinese-/Chinese dialect-speaking populations.",en,1,0.0,1,{'Medicine': 7581},0.0

Most academic institutions do not have this kind of manpower support, let alone the average community hospital. Furthermore, the workflow for the study at the University of Chicago was to only send highly cellular smears for NGS (>20% tumor density); those that did not pass bedside screening criteria were not sent for NGS, thus their study population was enriched with only successful specimens, which the authors readily acknowledged. In addition, although smears have been found in select studies to be a better source of undamaged tumor cells compared with formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cell blocks, it is not yet standard of care and many NGS companies will not accept cytology specimens for molecular profiling.3Fielding D.

Experimental evidence in rodents has indicated that estrogen depletion leads to a reduction of energy expenditure and physical activity. It is unclear whether treatment with estrogen therapy increases physical activity level in postmenopausal women. Methods A total of 27,327 postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative randomized double-blind trials of menopausal hormone therapy. Self-reported leisure-time physical activity at baseline, and years 1, 3, and 6 was quantified as metabolic equivalents (MET)-h/wk. In each trial, comparison between intervention and placebo groups of changes in physical activity levels from baseline to follow-up assessment was examined using linear regression models. Results In the CEE-alone trial, the increase in MET-h/wk was greater in the placebo group compared with the intervention group at years 3 ( P = 0.002) and 6 ( P &lt; 0.001). Similar results were observed when analyses were restricted to women who maintained an adherence rate ≥80% during the trial or who were physically active at baseline. In the CEE + MPA trial, the primary analyses did not show significant differences between groups, but the increase of MET-h/wk was greater in the placebo group compared with the intervention group at year 3 ( P = 0.004) among women with an adherence rate ≥80%.

We performed a single-arm prospective phase II clinical trial utilizing a novel treatment paradigm optimizing the utility of SBRT based on the individual patient’s probability for tumor control traded off against the risk of liver injury. We hypothesized that maximizing the utility of treatment would decrease toxicity while achieving the same tumor control rate as standard therapy. Methods: Patients with Child-Pugh (CP) A to B7 disease with tumors &amp;gt;3.5 cm, or CP ≥ B8 with any size tumor were prospectively enrolled on an IRB approved clinical trial to undergo SBRT with baseline dose optimization and mid-treatment response adaptation. Optimization and adaptation were based on the expected utility of treatment, calculated as a weighted average of the probability of 4 combinations of toxicity and efficacy outcomes. These calculations were based on the individual patient’s baseline indocyanine green retention at 15 minutes or albumin-bilirubin score (ALBI), CP score, intended dose and fractionation, and mean liver dose with the goal of maximizing the difference between the probability of local control compared to the probability of treatment-related toxicity. Primary endpoints were rate of liver decompensation as measured by ≥2 point change in CP score within 6 months, and lesion-specific local control. Overlap weighting was used to compare patients treated on protocol with patients receiving conventional SBRT at another high-volume cancer center. Results: 56 patients with 80 tumors met inclusion criteria and had a median follow-up of 11.2 months. 44 tumors with a median size of 3.8 cm were treated in CP-A to B7 patients, while 36 tumors with a median size of 2.1 cm were treated in CP ≥ B8 patients. Optimization resulted modification of initial dose for 38% of patients. Sixty-eight percent of patients underwent mid-treatment adaptation with either omission or dose reduction of the final two treatments based on change in expected utility. The 1 year freedom from local progression was 94%. A total of 21% of patients experienced a ≥ 2 point change in CP score within 6 months. Overlap weighted analysis revealed similar local control (HR 0.69, 95% CI [0.25-1.91], p = 0.48), and overall survival (HR 1.45, 95% CI [0.69-3.0], p = 0.33), with decreased toxicity (OR 0.26, 95% CI [0.07 - 0.99], p = 0.048) compared to conventional SBRT. Conclusion: SBRT for HCC patients with large tumors or poor liver function can be optimized via an individualized, utility-based treatment paradigm which may decrease treatment-related toxicity while maintaining tumor control.

While the impact of obesity on overall health is well-described, less is known about its ocular manifestations. Still, there are few studies in children and adolescents in this regard and they are inconsistent. However, some evidence suggests a significant role of overnutrition in the development of changes in retinal microvasculature parameters (wider venules, narrower arterioles, lower arteriovenous ratio). Higher values of intraocular pressure were found to be positively correlated with high body mass index (BMI) as well as obesity. In addition, the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) values seem to be lower in obese children, and there is a significant negative correlation between RNFL values and anthropometric and/or metabolic parameters. Changes also could be present in macular retinal thickness and choroidal thickness as well as in the retinal vessel density in children with obesity.

Children with CP are at risk for fragility fractures secondary to low bone mineral density, and although bisphosphonates are prescribed for the treatment of children with bone fragility, there is limited information on long-term bone impact and safety. Children with CP usually present overtubulated bones, and the thickening of cortical bone by pamidronate treatment can potentially further narrow the medullary canal. Our purpose was to report bone alterations attributable to pamidronate therapy that impact orthopedic care in children with CP. The study consisted of 41 children with CP treated with pamidronate for low bone mineral density from 2006 to 2020. Six children presented unique bone deformities and unusual radiologic features attributed to pamidronate treatment, which affected their orthopedic care. The cases included narrowing of the medullary canal and sclerotic bone, atypical femoral fracture, and heterotopic ossification. Treatment with bisphosphonate reduced the number of fractures from 101 in the pretreatment period to seven in the post-treatment period (P < 0.001). In conclusion, children with CP treated with bisphosphonate have a reduction in low-energy fractures; however, some fractures still happen, and pamidronate treatment can lead to bone alterations including medullary canal narrowing with sclerotic bone and atypical femoral fractures. In very young children, failure to remodel may lead to thin, large femoral shafts with cystic medullary canals. More widespread use of bisphosphonates in children with CP may make these bone alterations more frequent. Level of evidence: Level IV: Case series with post-test outcomes.",en,1,0.0,0,{},0.0

Methods: A consecutive series of patients undergoing arthroscopic RCR from 2018 to 2020 were included. Preoperative opioid use within one year of surgery was determined using the state prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP). Cumulative morphine milligram equivalents (MME) from prescriptions one year prior to surgery and the number of days the last opioid was prescribed before surgery determined. Postoperative outcomes at 3 and 6 months included visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Shoulder Score (ASES). The proportion of patients achieving patient acceptable symptom state (PASS) for VAS and ASES were determined. Multivariate generalized estimating equations models were utilized to determine the influence of preoperative opioid use on postoperative outcome scores with receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: 763 patients (47.6% male) with a mean age of 60.2 + 10.0 years were included. 488 patients (64%) had no history of opioid use one year prior to RCR, while 275 (36%) had an opioid prescription one year before RCR. Compared to patients without preoperative opioid use, patients with preoperative opioid use had an average ASES value 7.9 points lower (p&lt;0.001), and average VAS value 1.0 points greater (p&lt; 0.001). PASS for VAS and ASES at 6 months was achieved in 28% and 56% of patients prescribed preoperative opioids compared to 46% and 59% without. There was no association between the number of days from opioid prescription to surgery for ASES score (p=0.23) nor VAS score (p = 0.37). ROC analysis with MME categories of 0-200, 200-500, and &gt;500 MME yielded an area under the curve of 0.74 for PASS ASES and 0.78 for PASS VAS. Compared to patients with preoperative prescription &lt;200 MME, patients prescribed &gt;500 were 35.7% (p=0.03) less likely to achieve ASES PASS. For every 100 preoperative MME prescribed, ASES score decreased by 0.11 (p=0.001) while VAS increased 0.018 points (p&lt;0.001). For every 100 preoperative MME prescribed, the probability of achieving PASS for VAS decreased by 1.8% (p=0.004). Conclusions: Preoperative opioid use is a risk factor for diminished clinical outcome scores and higher pain following RCR in the early postoperative setting. The risk profile is modified by total preoperative opioid prescription MME as higher preoperative opioid use is associated with lower ASES, higher VAS, and lower likelihood of achieving PASS for VAS and ASES. Preoperative opioid prescription threshold values of 200 and 500 MME negatively worsened clinical outcomes to greater degrees. Patients with increasing preoperative opioid use should be counseled that lower clinical outcomes and higher pain levels may occur following RCR.",en,1,0.0,0,{},0.0

Objective To determine whether torsemide results in decreased mortality compared with furosemide among patients hospitalized for heart failure. Design, Setting, and Participants TRANSFORM-HF was an open-label, pragmatic randomized trial that recruited 2859 participants hospitalized with heart failure (regardless of ejection fraction) at 60 hospitals in the United States. Recruitment occurred from June 2018 through March 2022, with follow-up through 30 months for death and 12 months for hospitalizations. The final date for follow-up data collection was July 2022. Interventions Loop diuretic strategy of torsemide (n = 1431) or furosemide (n = 1428) with investigator-selected dosage. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was all-cause mortality in a time-to-event analysis. There were 5 secondary outcomes with all-cause mortality or all-cause hospitalization and total hospitalizations assessed over 12 months being highest in the hierarchy. The prespecified primary hypothesis was that torsemide would reduce all-cause mortality by 20% compared with furosemide. Results TRANSFORM-HF randomized 2859 participants with a median age of 65 years (IQR, 56-75), 36.9% were women, and 33.9% were Black. Over a median follow-up of 17.4 months, a total of 113 patients (53 [3.7%] in the torsemide group and 60 [4.2%] in the furosemide group) withdrew consent from the trial prior to completion. Death occurred in 373 of 1431 patients (26.1%) in the torsemide group and 374 of 1428 patients (26.2%) in the furosemide group (hazard ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.89-1.18]). Over 12 months following randomization, all-cause mortality or all-cause hospitalization occurred in 677 patients (47.3%) in the torsemide group and 704 patients (49.3%) in the furosemide group (hazard ratio, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.83-1.02]). There were 940 total hospitalizations among 536 participants in the torsemide group and 987 total hospitalizations among 577 participants in the furosemide group (rate ratio, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.84-1.07]). Results were similar across prespecified subgroups, including among patients with reduced, mildly reduced, or preserved ejection fraction. Conclusions and Relevance Among patients discharged after hospitalization for heart failure, torsemide compared with furosemide did not result in a significant difference in all-cause mortality over 12 months. However, interpretation of these findings is limited by loss to follow-up and participant crossover and nonadherence. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03296813",en,1,0.0,0,{},0.0

Methods and Results: Prospective controlled trials in which any cardioprotective agent was compared to no additional therapy or placebo in paediatric cancer patients receiving anthracyclines (PROSPERO: CRD42022367791). Outcomes were assessed using random and fixed-effects meta-analysis models as well as a synthesis without meta-analysis approach. A total of 24 reports of 19 trials were included in our review, 11 trials administered dexrazoxane, two trials administered the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril, one trial administered the beta-blocker carvedilol, one omega-3 fatty acids, one coenzyme Q10, one amifostine, one silymarin and one black seed oil. A total of 1333 paediatric patients receiving anthracyclines were included in meta-analysis of the cardio-protective effect of dexrazoxane in reducing the risk of developing significant systolic dysfunction. A risk ratio of 0.44 (95% CI: 0.33 to 0.61; I2 = 0%) was found, showing that the administration of dexrazoxane was highly effective. Overall, enalapril, carvedilol and dexrazoxane resulted in less left ventricular dysfunction and fewer cardiac biomarker abnormalities compared to placebo. Omega-3 fatty acids, silymarin and black seed oil each demonstrated benefit through less reduction of systolic function and fewer cardiac biomarker abnormalities. Conclusion: Enalapril and dexrazoxane are highly effective in preventing the anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in paediatric cancer patients with a highly acceptable safety profile.

At present, clinicians have a poor understanding of the disease, and the current epidemiology, diagnosis and comprehensive treatment of the disease have not been fully established. Case presentation: Herein, we report two patients with such tumors, one a 60-year-old woman hospitalized for blood glucose elevation and recurrent necrolytic migratory erythema (NME) of the trunk and limbs. Imaging studies showed an area (~3 cm) of reduced enhancement at head of pancreas. Examination of the subsequent pancreaticoduodenectomy specimen confirmed a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (G2). The patient’s blood glucose normalized postoperatively, and her skin erythema cleared. During follow-up, however, intramuscular injections (30 mg) of long-acting release (LAR) octreotide acetate microspheres were required at 28-day intervals for recurrent NME, and there was apparent hepatic and retroperitioneal nodal involvement after 36 months. The second patient was a 32-year-old woman hospitalized for recurrent glossitis, perioral dermatitis, and NME of both lower limbs. Imaging studies revealed a low-density nodule (~2 cm) in tail of pancreas, as well as multiple space-occupying lesions of liver. Distal pancreatectomy was undertaken, with splenectomy and palliative resection of hepatic nodules, confirming metastasis of a primary pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (G2) to liver. The NME resolved postoperatively, but this patient also received intramuscular octreotide LAR injections (30 mg) at 28-day intervals. After 6 months, percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of residual liver lesions took place. Conclusions： In patients with multiple liver metastases, palliative surgical treatment may confer patient benefits and prolong survival.

However, it is unclear whether there is a higher prevalence of one or more CVDs in COPD patients compared to those without COPD, and the magnitude of this increased prevalence. Methods This population-based cross-sectional study was conducted using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013–2018 among American adults aged 40 years and above. Multivariable logistic regression models (including unadjusted model, minimally adjusted model, and fully adjusted model) were conducted to investigate the association between COPD and the prevalence of one or more CVDs, including coronary heart disease, heart failure, angina pectoris, heart attack, diabetes, and stroke. Results This study included 11,425 participants, consisting of 661 participants with COPD and 10,764 participants without COPD. COPD patients had a significantly higher prevalence of CVD than those without COPD (59.6% vs. 28.4%). After adjusting for covariates, COPD was significantly associated with the prevalence of one CVD (OR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.6–3.0, p &lt; 0.001), two or more CVDs (OR = 3.3, 95% CI = 2.2–5.0, p &lt; 0.001), and three or more CVDs (OR = 4.3, 95% CI = 2.9–6.5, p &lt; 0.001).

Six new salts and five cocrystals of TNA are reported here and the crystal structures of the obtained multicomponent compounds were determined using single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) techniques. TNA formed salts with coformers maleic acid (MEA), nicotinic acid, DL-mandelic acid and saccharin. Salt formation with MEA resulted in three different solid forms, namely TNA–MEA (1:1), TNA–MEA (2:1) and TNA–MEA–H 2 O (1:1:1). All synthesized TNA salt structures were crystallized as anhydrous except for TNA–MEA–H 2 O (1:1:1). TNA formed cocrystals with phenolic coformers such as catechol (CAT), resorcinol, hydroquinone, pyrogallol (PRG) and phloroglucinol. All cocrystal structures crystallized as hydrates except for TNA–PRG (1:1). The detailed structural investigation using SC-XRD revealed the presence of robust N—H...O and O—H...O hydrogen bonds in TNA salts and cocrystals. In TNA cocrystals, except for TNA–CAT–H 2 O (1:1:1), the coformer molecules interact with TNA molecules via bridged water molecules. In all the salt structures, TNA exists as cations, in which both carboxylic and amino groups are protonated (–COOH and –NH 3 + ), while in cocrystals TNA exists as zwitterions with total charge zero. All synthesized multicomponent compounds were further characterized by differential scanning calorimetric, thermogravimetric and Fourier transform infrared analyses, and the formation of new multicomponent compounds were assessed based on the melting temperatures, percentage weight loss and stretching frequencies, respectively, corresponding to TNA/coformer molecules.

However, CN and CO linkages are often a metabolic liability because they are prone to hydrolysis. While C(sp2)–C(sp3) linkages are preferable in many cases, methods to make them require different starting materials or are less functional-group compatible. We show here a new, decarbonylative reaction that forms C(sp2)–C(sp3) bonds from the reaction of activated carboxylic acids (via 2-pyridyl esters) with activated alkyl groups derived from amines (via N-alkyl pyridinium salts) and alcohols (via alkyl halides). Key to this process is a remarkably fast, reversible oxidative addi-tion/decarbonylation sequence enabled by pyridone and bipyridine ligands that, under reaction conditions that purge CO(g), lead to a selective reaction.

The systematic characterizations illustrate that added Sn species exist in the external and internal surfaces of the main channels and catalyze propane dehydrogenation to propene. In addition, the introduced Sn species also decrease the acidity of the carrier and weaken the interaction between propene and carrier, resulting in an improved propene selectivity.

However, limitations from chromatography, including throughput and carryover, result in challenges with handling large sample numbers. Here, we combined intact protein MS with multiple front-end separations, including affinity capture, SampleStream, and high-field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS), to perform high-throughput and specific mass measurements of a multivalent antibody with one antigen-binding fragment (Fab) fused to an immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody. Generic affinity capture ensures the retention of both intact species 1Fab-IgG1 and the tentative degradation product IgG1. Subsequently, the analytes were directly loaded into SampleStream, where each injection occurs within ∼30 s. By separating ions prior to MS detection, FAIMS further offered improvement in signal-overnoise by ∼30% for denatured protein MS via employing compensation voltages that were optimized for different antibody species.

In this study, the extraction efficiency of VFAs from artificial solution and acidification fermentation broth of kitchen wastes using ionic liquids (ILs) was assessed at high pH. The effect of ILs addition ratio in diluent, volumetric solvent to feed ratio (S/F) on extraction efficiency were investigated.

The IL-101 ratio in dodecane and S/F was significant factors for the liquid–liquid extraction of VFAs. In general, a higher IL-101 ratio and S/F can promote the extraction efficiency of single VFAs. As a result, the maximum extraction rate of acetic acid (38.4–49.9%) and butyric acid (66.0–92.1%) from different VFA concentration solutions was observed at 10% IL-101 in dodecane and S/F = 2/1.

It uses light to catalyse the reduction of protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) to chlorophyllide, a key step in chlorophyll biosynthesis. Although a wealth of spectroscopic data have provided crucial mechanistic insight about the light-driven reaction chemistry, a structural rationale for POR photocatalysis has proved more challenging and remains hotly debated. Recent structural models of the ternary enzyme-substrate complex, derived from crystal and electron microscopy data, show differences in the orientation of the Pchlide substrate and the architecture of the POR active site that have significant implications for the catalytic mechanism of Pchlide reduction. Here, we have used a combination of computational and experimental approaches to investigate the compatibility of each of these structural models with the hypothesised reaction mechanisms and propose an alternative structural model for the cyanobacterial POR-Pchlide-NADPH ternary complex based on these findings. Through detailed site-directed mutagenesis studies we show that a strictly conserved Tyr residue, which has previously been proposed to act as the proton donor in POR photocatalysis, is not likely to be involved in this step of the reaction but is crucial for Pchlide binding. Instead, an active site Cys residue is important for both hydride and proton transfer reactions in POR and is proposed to act as the proton donor, either directly or through a water-mediated network. Moreover, a conserved Gln residue is found to be important for Pchlide binding and ensuring efficient photochemistry by tuning its electronic properties, likely by interacting with the central Mg atom of the substrate. This optimal ‘binding pose’ for the POR ternary enzyme-substrate complex illustrates how light energy can be harnessed to facilitate enzyme catalysis by this unique enzyme.",en,1,0.0,0,{},0.0

Moreover, these reactions often involve hazardous reagents, which is why biocatalytic routes for heterocycle formation have gained increasing attention. In recent years, several enzymes belonging to the amidohydrolase superfamily have been identified to generate heterocycles via cyclocondensation reactions. Of particular interest is the amidohydrolase MxcM, which catalyzes the formation of an imidazoline moiety in the biosynthesis of the anti-inflammatory natural product pseudochelin A. In this study, we present a concept for the immobilization of this enzyme using a fused hexahistidine tag for fixation onto a solid, porous carrier. Notably, the immobilization improves the enzyme’s tolerance to organic solvents. The immobilized MxcM exhibits a residual activity of 169% in the polar solvent acetonitrile compared to the free enzyme, and the storage stability in the presence of 20 vol% acetonitrile was ameliorated. In addition, an immobilized enzyme reactor (IMER) was designed that can be operated under flow conditions.

We herein proposed one molecular engineering strategy to regulate the H 2 O activation using aprotic organic small molecules with high Gutmann donor number as a solvation shell regulator. These organic molecules occupy the first solvation shell of K + and accumulate in the electrical double layer, decreasing the H 2 O density at the interface and the relative content of proton suppliers (free and coordinated H 2 O), suppressing the HER. The adsorbed H 2 O was stabilized via the second sphere effect and its dissociation was promoted by weakening the O−H bond, which accelerates the subsequent *CO 2 protonation kinetics and reduces the energy barrier.

In the latter, each iron atom is coordinated by a CO and CN ligand, connected by a CO and an azadithiolate ligand.

Here, we used the HydE protein as a nanocage to encapsulate and stabilize the complex‐B product generated by HydG.

The development of S1R-based drugs as therapeutic agents is a challenge due to the lack of simple functional assays to identify and classify S1R ligands. We have developed a novel nanoluciferase binary technology (NanoBiT) assay based on the ability of S1R to heteromerize with the binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) in living cells. The S1R-BiP heterodimerization biosensor allows for rapid and accurate identification of S1R ligands by monitoring the dynamics of association-dissociation of S1R and BiP. Acute treatment of cells with the S1R agonist PRE-084 produced rapid and transient dissociation of the S1R-BiP heterodimer, which was blocked by haloperidol. The effect of PRE-084 was enhanced by calcium depletion, leading to a higher reduction in heterodimerization even in the presence of haloperidol. Prolonged incubation of cells with S1R antagonists (haloperidol, NE-100, BD-1047, and PD-144418) increased the formation of S1R-BiP heteromers, while agonists (PRE-084, 4-IBP, and pentazocine) did not alter heterodimerization under the same experimental conditions.

Meanwhile, the effects of organic ligands on the Cr(III) oxidation are poorly known. Herein, we determined the kinetics of Cr1-xFex(OH)3 oxidation by oxygen in the dark as a function of pH and Fe/Cr ratio with/without the presence of a representative organic ligand-siderophore. Results showed that the Cr(III) oxidation rate increased linearly with increasing pH and Fe/Cr ratio. Thermodynamic calculations suggested that the enhanced Cr1-xFex(OH)3 oxidation with increasing pH was primarily due to the decreased ΔG value (i.e., the Gibbs free energy change) at higher pH. The decreased redox potentials (Eh) of Cr1-xFex(OH)3 suspensions with increasing Fe/Cr ratio accounted for the enhanced Cr(III) oxidation of iron-rich Cr1-xFex(OH)3. The siderophore greatly accelerated the Cr1-xFex(OH)3 oxidation at alkaline pH by promoting the formation of soluble organically complexed Cr(III), which can be oxidized readily by oxygen via mineral-surface catalyzed oxidation. Overall, this study highlights the specific role of oxygen and its synergistic role with the siderophore in the oxidation of solid Cr1-xFex(OH)3, which should be taken into consideration in assessing the long-term stability of Cr(III)-Fe(III) hydroxides.",en,1,0.0,0,{},0.0

A simple, benign and highly efficient ultrasound-mediated route was designed to produce chromene derivatives via one-pot, multicomponent reaction of aldehyde, malononitrile, and resorcinol at room temperature. The ultrasound-mediated synthetic route was studied here exhibits some remarkable advantages such as short reaction times, green reaction conditions, operational simplicity, high yields, and easy work-up and purification steps. In addition to this interestingly found that there was unnoticeable loss of reactivity when the catalyst was quantitatively recovered from the reaction medium and recycled up to five times.Keywords: 2-Amino-3-cyano-7-hydroxy-4H-chromenearyl aldehydemalononitrileresorcinolgreen synthesis AcknowledgmentsThe authors are thankful to the Department of Chemistry, Yashavantrao Chavan Institute of Science, Satara, Lead college of Karmveer Bhaurao Patil University, Satara for providing laboratory and support.

They are potentially unsafe consumer products, with significant evidence they pose a risk to human health. Therefore, developing rapid, economical test methods to assess the chemical composition of e-liquids in heated and unheated forms and the aerosols produced by e-cigarettes is crucial. Four different e-liquids were heated using two different methods: (1) “typical” vaping using an e-cigarette device, by cycling “on” for 3 s every minute for 2 h (e-liquid obtained from remainder in the tank and aerosol collected in an impinger), and (2) “accelerated” heating, using an e-cigarette coil submerged in e-liquid and heating in short 20 s bursts on then 20 s off for 2 min only (liquid traps aerosol produced). All e-liquids were then analysed to test for the presence and quantity of 13 chemicals by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and compared to an unheated sample. E-liquids heated with the accelerated method showed a comparable trend to the typical heating method, i.e. increase or decrease in chemical compound quantity, for more than two-thirds of the detected compounds analysed over all e-liquids. Six chemicals were detected as aerosol from the impinger fluid with the typical heating method at negligible levels. We propose that this accelerated version of the typical vaping method could form the basis of a standardized screening tool to test heated e-liquids (and e-cigarette aerosols) for harmful or banned substances. This will ensure that only approved products reach the consumer and reduce potential e-cigarette harm.",en,1,1237643.051264526,19,"{'Chemistry': 66609, 'Geology': 10100, 'Geography': 6028, 'Economics': 15306, 'Materials science': 9342, 'History': 6324, 'Psychology': 7187, 'Biology': 3302, 'Mathematics': 901, 'Sociology': 1429, 'Environmental science': 1733, 'Medicine': 3971, 'Philosophy': 2462, 'Computer science': 689, 'Engineering': 147, 'Political science': 480, 'Art': 640, 'Business': 128, 'Physics': 37}",1.0

Food diversification is needed to reduce dependency on imported wheat. The use of wheat flour as the main raw material for cookies can be replaced using flour from local Indonesian ingredients such as mocaf (modified cassava). However, the low protein content and the absence of glutein in mocaf can affect the texture of the cookies. Mung bean dregs and Soy Protein Isolate (ISP) can be used as a source of protein and improving the characteristics of mocaf cookies. The content of fiber and iron in mung bean dregs can improve the functional properties of cookies. The purpose of this study was to determine the best ratio between mung bean dregs and mocaf flour and ISP's concentration on producing mocaf cookies with the best characteristics. The research consists of the preliminary stage and the main stage. The preliminary stage is characterization of mung bean dregs. The main stage is the manufacture of mocaf cookies with factors are the ratio of mocaf flour (TM) with mung bean dregs flour (ASKH), and concentration of ISP. The results showed that the best cookies were obtained from cookies with a TM:ASKH ratio of 50:50 and an ISP of 15%. Mocaf cookies with the addition of mung bean dregs and ISP had a moisture content of 3.54 ± 12.92 %, protein 7.43 ± 14.25 %, fat 21.40 ± 1.54 %, ash 1.76 ± 1.53 %, carbohydrate 65.45 ± 0.61, iron 1.39 ± 1.51 mg/100 g, dietary fiber 11.45 ± 0.37 %, hardness 1418.49 ± 0.39 gf, kamba density 0.31 ± 1.19 g/mL.

Based on the current situation of automobile headlight inspection in China, the impact of unqualified airtightness of automobile headlights was analyzed, and common fault modes and prevention research were analyzed. Analyzing and preventing the impact of substandard airtightness and common failure modes of automotive headlights is a high-risk process.

The aim is to enable the design of a structural element while balancing between its performance as a load-bearing element and its stability during the printing process. Physical buildability is quantified by stress constraints imposed on the fresh concrete, whose time-dependent strength is determined according to a rheological material characterization. This is complemented by geometric buildability that is achieved by imposing constraints on the overlap between layers.

The latest development in power electronics and electrical railway systems has increased the risks of electromagnetic interference (EMI) and intentional EMI (IEMI) emissions, introducing new challenges to the railway radio communications network. It is vital to have a robust and reliable railway communication network that can be resistant and immune to these interferences for the safe and efficient operation of modern railway systems. Yet, the source and new features of EMI and IEMI emerging along with the latest technological development have not been thoroughly investigated and understood. This review article aims to fill the research gap. First, railway communications systems are introduced. The EMI and IEMI are discussed at the whole system level, and the corresponding impacts on the signaling and communication systems are reviewed comprehensively. Current electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) methods are surveyed, and challenges of tackling the impacts of EMI and IEMI on the signaling and communication systems are discussed. Finally, future research directions are outlined.",en,1,0.0,0,{},0.0

https://openalex.org/W4320915151,2023,Engineering,"Special issue on all‐electric and hybrid‐electric flightPublic and political pressures for environmental improvements are driving a wave of current interest in all-electric and hybrid-electric aircraft. These emerging new aircraft propulsion systems bring with them the promise of net-zero emissions and greatly reduced noise profiles. The main application focus is currently around smaller aircraft including general aviation, drones, urban air mobility, commuter, and electrical vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. In the slightly longer term, business and regional aircraft operators are also keen to adopt these novel propulsion systems and exploit their benefits. The aim of this special issue of the IET Electrical Systems in Transportation journal is to showcase original research on enabling technologies for all-electric and hybrid-electric flight. For this publication, there was also a desire to feature case studies, which express the ambitions of the customer base and detail the key technical hurdles to be addressed by the supply chain. Many propulsion system demonstrations are in development, whether in a lab environment or progressing to flight trials, and submissions on original research addressing the key technical challenges were also encouraged. Technology improvements in electrical machines, power electronics, energy storage, thermal management systems, and electrical system integration (including advanced control and protection) are required to make the vision for a more electric aviation fleet a reality. Papers which detail specific relevant technical advancements or review a range of these technological contributions are also included in this special issue. Routes to net zero carbon emissions Aircraft noise mitigation Electrical propulsion system architectures Electrical energy storage Electrical machines (on-board power generators and propulsion motors) Electrical power distribution (including enablers for higher voltage systems) Power electronic converters Superconducting technologies (including cryogenic systems) Thermal management systems Electrical system control, protection, diagnostics, and health monitoring Fuel cell systems Power and propulsion system modelling and simulation Despite the many aerospace industry projects underway with the intention of realising the potential of all-electric and hybrid-electric flight, there appears to be a shortfall in underpinning research to support these projects. It is hoped that this special issue will inspire researchers and encourage innovations that will help to meet the many challenges that lie ahead in developing a sustainable and environmentally friendly air travel ecosystem. The papers selected for this special issue have been peer reviewed by the Guest Editors and specialist reviewers. They include case studies on industrial flight trials for all-electric and hybrid-electric propulsion systems, evaluations against other modes of transport, innovative propulsion system architectures, and novel power electronics converter solutions. The selected papers are summarised in the following sections. This paper reviews the numerous engineering challenges faced by the ACCEL consortium comprising Rolls-Royce, Electroflight, and YASA in designing, developing, and flying an all-electric aircraft. Three world records were set by the project team for top speed over 3 and 15 km distances and for the fastest 3000 m climb as officially verified by Fédération Aéronautique Internationale. During its record-breaking runs, the aircraft also clocked up a maximum top speed of 623 km/h (387.4mph), making it the world's fastest all-electric vehicle. Power-to-mass ratio is one of the key characteristics of most high-performance vehicles and the ACCEL aircraft is no different. Project ACCEL pushed the limits of energy management, thermal management, and mass saving, while maintaining measured safety for the pilot and crew to ultimately achieve the world record-breaking flights. The blank sheet design of the Energy Storage System and Powertrain allowed for an appropriately optimised solution. The closing stages of the project included assembly, ground testing, and the exciting flight operation of the aircraft at MoD Boscombe Down. This paper evaluates various modes of transport against the dual requirements of net zero carbon emissions and user convenience, in particular speed of travel, and cost of transportation. Results show that when operated across a whole country, battery-powered ePlanes have the lowest energy use, as measured by well-to-wing efficiency, of high-speed transport systems such as the UK's HS2 and conventional diesel rail systems, although this condition may not hold for extremely high passenger numbers per hour as seen in metropolitan areas with high-density populations. Various proposed disruptive technologies lower the cost of ownership when combined with changes in transport paradigm. With the advent of eVTOL aircraft, point-to-point journeys are achievable, which would further reduce journey times and alleviate the congestion from other modes of transport. In this study a novel H-type hybrid-electric aircraft propulsion architecture is proposed to address the issues associated with the radial electric propulsion architecture. In a radial architecture, a fault on the main bus or failure of the generator leads to the shutting down of all the propulsion motors in that channel, thus increasing the burden on the remaining motors to maintain the power required by the aeroplane. As a result, it is necessary to oversize the motors for the purpose of compensating for the loss of other motors. To mitigate these issues, a new H-type architecture is proposed to isolate the faulted channel while still maintaining power flow to the remaining healthy motors. The proposed architecture minimises the oversizing of various components in the system as compared to a radial propulsion architecture. The sizing of components and the amount of overall mass reduction by using the proposed architecture is discussed in this study. A Hardware-in-the-Loop platform is used to validate the performance of both architectures for faults at different locations, and the results are presented. This paper describes how, as a power electronic converter with bidirectional energy transmission, the Dual Active Bridge (DAB) has broad application prospects in electrified propulsion systems for hybrid-electric flight. High efficiency, high reliability, and long life expectancy are demanded for such applications. This paper proposes a new Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) optimisation control strategy which is based on the feedback temperature fluctuations of Gallium Nitride (GaN) power transistors to improve the life of the whole circuit. Detailed simulation results demonstrate the precise life of the GaN power transistors and verify the accuracy of the novel optimisation control strategy. Insulated Gate Bipolar Translators (IGBTs) are used to compare the life of conventional silicon-based power devices with the GaN power transistors. A Hardware-in-the-Loop platform test is used to further validate the proposed control method. This paper describes the collaborative efforts between Tecnam, Rolls-Royce, and Rotax to equip a 4-seat Tecnam P2010 aircraft with a parallel hybrid-electric powertrain, the first of its kind ever developed for general aviation, to help reduce fuel consumption while maintaining, and even extending, the aircraft range. The High Power, High Scalability, Hybrid Powertrain (H3PS) project is set out to design, build, ground test, and demonstrate in a flight campaign such as a propulsion system. Creating a parallel hybrid-electric drive system, which brings together the electric and combustion engine worlds, creates a completely new set of challenges in the design, assembly, operation, and safety assurance of the aircraft which must be addressed for a successful business proposition. The paper reflects on some of the challenges faced, as this innovative and scalable powertrain was developed on the road to minimise emissions in the aviation industry. Overall, we feel extremely privileged to have guest edited this special issue on All-electric and Hybrid-electric Flight for the IET Electrical Systems in Transportation journal. We are confident that our objective of including papers that will inspire interesting developments and new research in the areas of electrical aerospace propulsion systems has been met. While great strides have been taken to shape the future of all-electric and hybrid-electric aircraft, there are still many challenges to be addressed to ensure their widespread uptake with the consequential environmental benefits for all of us. It is imperative that industry and academia alike intensify efforts to close the technology gaps highlighted in these special issue papers.

The model was matched with experimental data from the WESTT CS/BV virtual test bench for the baseline count and then implemented to analyse the engine behaviour at alternative counts. The corresponding changes in the compressor pressure ratio and efficiency were modelled in a commercial 3D CFD software and transferred to the zero-dimensional model with proper scaling. The results proved that the baseline design lied in the optimal range of thrust-specific fuel consumption.

The proposed PGA consists of a low-noise amplifier (LNA), a variable gain amplifier (VGA), an RC low-pass filter (LPF), and a voltage buffer. The structure of LNA and VGA is an active band-pass filter (BPF) constructed using an operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) and passive elements. The PGA’s voltage gain and cut-off frequency can be adjusted by controlling the resistor connected to the common-mode voltage, the feedback capacitor, and the OTA compensation capacitor. An AC coupling capacitor is placed at the input stage to eliminate the DC offset and low-frequency noise of the PGA input signal. In addition, by arranging the feedback resistor and the feedback capacitor, the band-pass filtering function is implemented to block out noise at frequencies higher than the signal band. The PGA can adjust the voltage gain with a 6-dB step from 56 dB to 110 dB in the ultrasonic signal band from 30 kHz to 70 kHz. The design is designed in a 0.18-µm CMOS process.

However, the blades of the conventional rotor have poor conformality with the nacelle profile, which will greatly increase the drag of the UAV after folding. This paper proposes an integrated method for the design of rotor and nacelle considering geometric compatibility to reduce the drag of the folded rotor and nacelle, so as to further improve the aerodynamic efficiency in cruise while ensuring the rotor efficiency in the vertical flight mode. A geometric mapping model based on nacelle design parameters and rotor design parameters is established, and a parametric model and aerodynamic optimization model of the outer arc airfoil family are developed. In addition, a rotor performance analysis model and a neural network response surface model for nacelle drag prediction that meet the requirements of confidence level are established. Based on the oblique inflow blade element momentum theory method, numerical simulation method, and genetic algorithm, an integrated optimization framework of the design of the conformal rotor and nacelle is built. Then, a geometrically compatible integrated optimization for the rotor and nacelle is carried out with the objective of maximizing energy efficiency in the full mission profile. Finally, a conformal rotor and nacelle design solution is obtained, which satisfies geometric compatibility and thrust constraints while providing high thrust efficiency and low cruising drag. A comparison of the results of the integrated design and the conventional rotor optimization design shows that the drag of the conventional rotor is 3.45 times that of the conformal integrated design in the cruising state, which proves the effectiveness and necessity of the proposed method.",en,1,20248.15954400239,2,"{'Engineering': 7012, 'Computer science': 4196}",1.0

To reduce the likelihood of this issue, efforts have been made to identify the causes of stuck pipes. The main mechanisms that cause stuck pipes include drill cutting of the formation, inappropriate hole-cleaning, wellbore instability, and differential sticking forces, particularly in highly deviated wellbores. The significant consequences of a stuck pipe include an increase in well costs and Non-Productive Time (NPT), and in the worst-case scenario, the loss of a wellbore section and down-hole equipment, or the need to sidetrack, plug, or abandon the well. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the challenges associated with pipe sticking during drilling operations.

In this paper, the Petri Net (PN) simulation models are developed to quantitatively assess the OWT availability and operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. By investigating the impact of two CM approaches (i.e. purpose-designed CM and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)-based CM) and their combinations with various maintenance strategies, the paper addresses two fundamental questions about OWT CM that have plagued the offshore wind sector for many years. They are ‘is a wind farm SCADA system a viable alternative to purpose-designed condition monitoring system (CMS)’ and ‘what is the best way to integrate CMSs and maintenance strategies to maximise the financial benefit of OWTs’. The research suggests that although utilising both a wind farm SCADA system and a purpose-designed CMS can achieve the highest turbine availability, it is not the most cost-effective option in terms of maintenance expenses. Instead, combining purpose-designed CM with less frequent advanced service can achieve the desired availability at the lowest cost. Furthermore, the use of a purpose-designed CMS is essential for the economical operation of OWTs and cannot be replaced by the current wind farm SCADA system.",en,1,469353.1718947609,18,"{'Engineering': 71414, 'Mathematics': 4515, 'Sociology': 8781, 'Environmental science': 2863, 'Art': 1911, 'Business': 1816, 'Psychology': 736, 'Geography': 1460, 'History': 1972, 'Geology': 95, 'Political science': 652, 'Physics': 53, 'Philosophy': 497, 'Economics': 86, 'Computer science': 435, 'Materials science': 133, 'Medicine': 19, 'Chemistry': 19}",1.0

The isolation resistors that are essential in the FPD can be shared to absorb the signal reflected back to the input port. To enhance the absorption performance, only one synergistic absorptive stub is required and added to the input port.

The flow rate reduction due to the enclosure installed could be more than 7% at a lower fan speed.

This article presents advancements to floating wind farm simulation capabilities that allow the dynamic modeling of shared-mooring floating wind arrays—specifically, platform coupling through shared lines and proper phasing of wave loads across the array. These capabilities are demonstrated on a 10-turbine shared-mooring array featuring two staggered rows of wind turbines. A baseline array design with individually moored turbines is used as a basis for comparison. Coupled analysis using FAST.Farm shows that the shared-mooring design has smaller fluctuations in surge when compared to the baseline design. The mean and maximum platform offsets are highest in normal operating conditions, but the maximum mooring line tensions are highest in 50-year storm conditions. Power spectral density analysis of platform surge and sway motions shows that the shared mooring configuration does not introduce any significant inter-platform resonances. The tower-base bending moment statistics and the line tension damage equivalent loads indicate no consequential differences in turbine loading or mooring fatigue life. Anchor load analysis shows that the total required anchor capacity for the shared-mooring array is decreased by approximately 25% when shared anchors are used. Dynamic simulations of the shared mooring system under line failures show that remaining line tensions stay within bounds and that offsets are significantly smaller when compared to the baseline design.

Approaching it from a theoretical standpoint has proved to be notoriously difficult, however. In continuation of Goodrich et al.'s early efforts, explicitly espousing the goal of putting the MapReduce framework on footing equal to that of long-established models such as the PRAM, we investigate the obvious complexity question of how the computational power of MapReduce algorithms compares to that of combinational Boolean circuits commonly used for parallel computations. Relying on the standard MapReduce model introduced by Karloff et al. a decade ago, we develop an intricate simulation technique to show that any problem in NC (i.e., a problem solved by a logspace-uniform family of Boolean circuits of polynomial size and a depth polylogarithmic in the input size) can be solved by a MapReduce computation in O(T(n)/log⁡n) rounds, where n is the input size and T(n) is the depth of the witnessing circuit family. Thus, we are able to closely relate the standard, uniform NC hierarchy modeling parallel computations to the deterministic MapReduce hierarchy DMRC by proving that NCi+1⊆DMRCi for all i∈N. Besides the theoretical significance, this result has important applied aspects as well. In particular, we show for all problems in NC1—many practically relevant ones, such as integer multiplication and division, the parity function, and recognizing balanced strings of parentheses being among these—how to solve them in a constant number of deterministic MapReduce rounds.",en,1,29718778.92968577,19,"{'Mathematics': 69542, 'Geography': 108196, 'Economics': 40445, 'History': 178799, 'Political science': 75733, 'Psychology': 57658, 'Geology': 10883, 'Sociology': 158745, 'Environmental science': 109061, 'Art': 73355, 'Philosophy': 104284, 'Chemistry': 20717, 'Computer science': 34053, 'Business': 78944, 'Biology': 8275, 'Physics': 13363, 'Medicine': 11721, 'Engineering': 18704, 'Materials science': 5829}",1.0

However, little attention has been paid to excavating discriminative representations of each node from multiview heterogeneous networks in an unsupervised manner. To that end, we propose a novel unsupervised multiview graph embedding method, called multiview deep graph infomax (MVDGI). The backbone of our proposed model sought to maximize the mutual information between the view-dependent node representations and the fused unified representation via contrastive learning. Specifically, the MVDGI first uses an encoder to extract view-dependent node representations from each single-view graph. Next, an aggregator is applied to fuse the view-dependent node representations into the view-independent node representations. Finally, a discriminator is adopted to extract highly discriminative representations via contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the MVDGI achieves better performance than the benchmark methods on five real-world datasets, indicating that the obtained node representations by our proposed approach are more discriminative than by its competitors for classification and clustering tasks.",en,1,0.0,0,{},0.0

Firstly, Wasserstein distance is introduced to change the loss function, which makes the training of the network more stable; secondly, conditional information is added, and the network has the ability to generate and discriminate image data with label information; finally, the residual module is added to improve the quality of generated images. The results demonstrate that by applying CRDCGAN to the augmented rock image dataset, the accuracy of the classification model trained on this dataset is as high as 96.38%, which is 13.39% higher than that of the classification model trained on the non-augmented dataset, and 8.56% and 6.27% higher than that of the traditional dataset augmented method and the DCGAN dataset augmentation method, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W4366660402,2023,Computer science,"Auxo: A Scalable and Efficient Graph Stream Summarization StructureA graph stream refers to a continuous stream of edges, forming a huge and fast-evolving graph. The vast volume and high update speed of a graph stream bring stringent requirements for the data management structure, including sublinear space cost, computation-efficient operation support, and scalability of the structure. Existing designs summarize a graph stream by leveraging a hash-based compressed matrix and representing an edge using its fingerprint to achieve practical storage for a graph stream with a known upper bound of data volume. However, they fail to support the dynamically extending of graph streams. In this paper, we propose Auxo, a scalable structure to support space/time efficient summarization of dynamic graph streams. Auxo is built on a proposed novel prefix embedded tree (PET) which leverages binary logarithmic search and common binary prefixes embedding to provide an efficient and scalable tree structure. PET reduces the item insert/query time from O (| E |) to O ( log | E |) as well as reducing the total storage cost by a log | E | scale, where | E | is the size of the edge set in a graph stream. To further improve the memory utilization of PET during scaling, we propose a proportional PET structure that extends a higher level in a proportionally incremental style. We conduct comprehensive experiments on large-scale real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of this design. Results show that Auxo significantly reduces the insert and query time by one to two orders of magnitude compared to the state of the arts. Meanwhile, Auxo achieves efficiently and economically structure scaling with an average memory utilization of over 80%.",en,1,0.0,0,{},0.0
https://openalex.org/W4385756479,2023,Computer science,"GAPMSF-Net: Generalized Alternating Projection with Multi-stage Fusion Network for Snapshot Compressive ImagingSnapshot compressive imaging (SCI) aims to fully capture 3-dimensional spatio-temporal data using 2D sensors. It takes different masks to modulate the high-speed scene during exposure to get compressed frames. In SCI systems, model-based and learning-based methods have been used to reconstruct video frames from compressed samples, but most of these methods cannot achieve a good balance between accuracy and speed. For SCI reconstruction, generalized alternating projection (GAP) is one of the most effective methods. To enhance the SCI reconstruction performance from training, we propose a deep unfolding network called GAPMSF-Net whose stages are unfolded from the iterations of the GAP algorithm to allow learnable parameters in reconstruction. First, motivated by the fact the accelerated computation process of the original GAP algorithm can significantly improve the convergence speed of the algorithm, we design a deep acceleration network based on its computational principle, which can learn a rule to adaptively adjust the linear manifold in a data-driven manner based on the reconstruction results of the previous phase. In addition, to enhance the information interaction between different reconstruction stages in the deep unrolling algorithm, we design a multi-stage fusion of deep priors. At each reconstruction stage, the deep prior fuses and interacts with the hidden states that take all the previous information. The superiority of the proposed method is demonstrated on simulated and real datasets in terms of accuracy and computational complexity.",en,1,0.0,0,{},0.0

However, improper API usage can result in significant issues such as unexpected outcomes, security vulnerabilities and system crashes. To detect API misuses, current methods primarily rely on comparing established API usage patterns with target points for automated detection, mainly based on pre-validated datasets. Nonetheless, there is a scarcity of publicly available datasets on API misuses and their corresponding fixes, which hinders data-driven research. Moreover, most existing techniques concentrate on statically typed languages, such as Java and C, with only a few addressing dynamic languages like Python effectively, due to difficulties in handling dynamic features. Therefore, it is essential to identify Python API misuses and their fixes automatically and promptly. In this paper, we introduce HatPAM, a Hybrid Analysis and Attention-based Python API-Misuse Miner, which (a) provides a method for automatically mining true-positive commits related to Python API-misuse fixes from GitHub and (b) presents the subsequent processing for classifying Python API misuses in true-positive cases. Particularly, HatPAM applies hybrid static analysis and introduces a structure-based attention mechanism to examine syntax, semantics and structural features in Python code context, and considers the consistency between code and developers’ natural intent to significantly reduce false-positive cases. Evaluation on six popular Python projects reveals that HatPAM outperforms various state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 92.2% Precision, 86.7% Recall and 89.3% F1-score, indicating its capability to identify and classify Python API-misuse commits.",en,1,0.0,0,{},0.0

In particular, manufacturing is increasingly focused on creating systems that detect and categorize defects, facilitating root-cause investigations. This research paper delves into the use of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches for defect detection in hot-rolled steel, focusing on examining the robustness of the different defect detection techniques. In the case of ML approaches, three primary feature extraction techniques: local binary pattern (LBP), histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), were employed. Generally, GLCM demonstrated relatively good performance, i.e., attained precision, recall, and f1-score values of 0.91 with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Similarly, using SVM, LBP attains precision, recall, and f1-score values of 0.89. Deep-learning methodologies such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), CNN plus VGG19 (CNN + VGG19), and you only look once version 7 (YOLOv7) were employed to investigate and classify the hot-rolled steel defects. CNN + VGG-19 and YOLOv7 exhibited excellent defect detection performance, attaining accuracy values of 0.9639 and 0.915, respectively. Overall, the results demonstrated relatively higher performance can be derived from using deep learning approaches such as CNN + VGG19 compared to traditional machine learning approaches.",en,1,33322973.502578344,19,"{'Computer science': 110195, 'Political science': 77723, 'Environmental science': 111235, 'History': 140696, 'Medicine': 39775, 'Mathematics': 76494, 'Psychology': 59029, 'Art': 71825, 'Physics': 8716, 'Geography': 83936, 'Sociology': 136140, 'Engineering': 24862, 'Business': 52313, 'Economics': 27863, 'Geology': 5206, 'Materials science': 6859, 'Philosophy': 85973, 'Biology': 28973, 'Chemistry': 9380}",1.0

Data are the source of technology that is generated hugely by various sources. Big data is dealing with huge data volumes or complex data. The major concern in big data is security threats. Security concerns create a negative impact on the user on the aspect of trust. In big data still, security threats exist as commonly known as DDOS (Distributed-Denial-of-Service) attacks, data loss, Inadequate Data Backups, System Vulnerabilities, and Phishing as well as Social Engineering Attacks. In our work, we have taken the data loss and Inadequate Data Backups issues into consideration. We analyze that RSA (Rivest, Shamir, & Adleman) is the most secure cryptography mechanism. In cloud computing, user authentication is the weaker section to be secured. Generally, the cryptography mechanism is done in the authentication section only. We implemented our new idea of registration with selected images and pins for processing RSA. By valid authentication approval earned by the proposed mechanism, the user is allowed to use the cloud database, encryption, decryption, etc. To prove the efficiency level of our proposed system, a comparison work is conducted between DSSE (Digital Signature Standard Encryption) and EFSSA (Efficient framework for securely sharing a file using asymmetric key distribution management). The experimental work is carried out and the performance evaluation is done using encryption time and decryption time analysis, throughput, and processing time. On this observation, the security level attained by ERSA is far better in comparison to DSSE and EFSSA with the maximum throughput attained by the proposed E-RSA being 500 Mb/Min and encryption time of 3.2 s, thus ensuring the user trust in using the cloud environment.",en,1,5157135.834405891,19,"{'Computer science': 51974, 'Business': 10093, 'Mathematics': 13555, 'Art': 13181, 'Political science': 13521, 'History': 29940, 'Medicine': 7683, 'Geography': 13019, 'Philosophy': 16739, 'Psychology': 7077, 'Engineering': 5473, 'Environmental science': 20066, 'Materials science': 1839, 'Sociology': 30654, 'Physics': 1341, 'Economics': 2940, 'Biology': 4826, 'Chemistry': 494, 'Geology': 495}",1.0

Nevertheless, low-cost GNSS devices often face the challenges in effectively capturing and tracking satellite signals, which leads to losing the observations at certain frequencies. Moreover, the observation peculiarities of low-cost devices are in contradistinction to those of traditional geodetic GNSS receivers. In this contribution, a low-cost PPP-RTK model that considers the unique characteristics of different types of measurements is developed and its performance is fully evaluated with u-blox F9P receivers equipped with three distinctive antenna configurations: vertical dipole, microstrip patch, and helix antennas. Several static and kinematic experiments in different scenarios are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results indicate that the mixed-frequency PPP-RTK model outperforms the traditional dual-frequency one with higher positioning accuracy and fixing percentage. Among the three low-cost antennas tested, the vertical dipole antenna demonstrates the best performance under static conditions and shows a comparable performance as geodetic antennas with a positioning accuracy of 0.02 m, 0.01 m and 0.07 m in the east, north, and up components, respectively. Under low-speed kinematic scenarios, the helix antenna outperforms the other two with a positioning accuracy of (0.07 m, 0.07 m, 0.34 m). Furthermore, the helix antenna is also proved to be the best choice for vehicle navigation with an ambiguity fixing rate of over 95% and a positioning accuracy of (0.13 m, 0.14 m, 0.36 m).",en,1,0.0,0,{},0.0

In this paper, we introduce Fabolas and learning curve extrapolation as two methods for accelerating hyperparameter optimization. Four methods for quickening training were presented including Bag of Little Bootstraps, k-means clustering for Support Vector Machines, subsample size selection for gradient descent, and subsampling for logistic regression. Additionally, we also discuss the use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and other stochastic optimization techniques to improve the efficiency of AutoML systems in managing big data. These methods enhance various facets of the training process, making it feasible to combine them in diverse ways to gain further speedups.

The exhumed Middle Eocene strata of the Banastón deep-water system in the Aínsa depocentre, Spain, allow the interplay between submarine slope confined systems, mass flow deposits, and syn-depositional compressional tectonics to be investigated. This study focuses on the Banastón II sub-unit, interpreted as low-sinuosity and narrow (2-3 km wide) channel-belt deposits confined laterally by opposing tectonically induced, fine-grained slopes. The studied succession (111 m-thick) is exposed along a 1.5 km long depositional dip-orientated (SE-NW) outcrop belt and documented here using facies analysis and physical correlation of 10 measured sections. Results show a stratigraphic evolution in which the channel axes migrated to the southwest, away from a growing structure in the northeastern part of the Aínsa depocentre. Uplift of the active margin promoted breaching of channel walls and confining slopes, with mass failures and the development of sand-rich crevasse scour-fills and crevasse lobes. We show that crevasse deposits form an important component of the overbank succession. These crevasse lobes are characterised by structureless thick and medium beds that form &lt; 5 m thick packages in proximal parts and thin abruptly over 1 km into structured thin beds similar to the heterolithic dominated overbank deposits. Although development of crevasse lobes has been observed in multiple deep-water systems in ancient and modern systems, this study documents, for the first time, crevasse lobe development on the active compressional margins of a foreland basin rather than in the opposing and more stable and gentle margin.

The E-W oriented Büyük Menderes graben cross-cuts the broadly N-S oriented Bozdoğan and Karacasu grabens, of which the boundary faults of the latter are the source of seismic activity. Geomorphic indices, including drainage basin asymmetry, mountain front sinuosity, valley-floor width to valley height ratio, stream length-gradient index and normalized channel steepness index, were used to evaluate the boundary fault segments of the Bozdoğan and Karacasu grabens. The results indicate that both grabens are tectonically active and therefore regions of earthquake potential, consistent with the epicenters of earthquakes.

Previous studies have suggested the Nb-REE enriched alkaline rocks were derived from mantle sources metasomatized during subduction-related crustal recycling processes. However, details on how these rare metal enriched mantle reservoirs form are poorly known. In this study, we present detailed petrographic and geochemical data for the Nb-REE enriched alkali basalt and trachyte from Tianbao volcanics located in South Qinling, Central China. UPb dating of titanite from alkali basalt and trachyte yielded identical ages of ∼430 Ma. The alkali basalt in Tianbao contains high TiO2, total alkali and Na2O/K2O, and relative enrichment of LREE, Th, U, Nb, Ta, Zr and Hf. Compared to the alkali basalt, the trachyte has lower Ti and P, but higher Al, Na, K, REE, Nb and Zr contents. Moreover, they have similar Sr-Nd-Pb isotope compositions with low initial 87Sr/86Sr (0.70346 to 0.70566), positive εNd(t) (+3.61 to +4.61), and moderate 206Pb/204Pb (17.59 to 18.61), 207Pb/204Pb (15.54 to 15.63) and 208Pb/204Pb (37.64 to 38.65). SiO2 content shows a slightly positive correlation with (87Sr/86Sr)i and negative correlation with εNd(t), indicating that crustal contamination was involved in the evolution of at least the more siliceous magmas. MELTS modeling reveals that trachyte can evolve from the alkali basalt by fractional crystallization of clinopyroxene, FeTi oxides, feldspar, biotite and apatite with <5% contamination of local metasedimentary or felsic rocks. The batch melting modeling indicates that the alkali basalt could be formed via mixing of a low-degree (F = 5%) melt of mantle peridotite (∼82%) and a high-degree (F = 30%) melt of metasomatic hornblendite veins (∼18%). The initial Sr-Nd-Pb isotopes of these volcanics are consistent with those of global ocean island basalts, with mixed components of depleted MORB, HIMU and EMI type mantle sources. These data, together with the regional tectono-magmatic framework, are consistent with a model for magma generation from a mantle metasomatized by the Neoproterozoic subducted oceanic crust.

Three Hercynian tectonic phases have been evidenced in the area are: Early Carboniferous (E1), Late Carboniferous-Permian (E2), and a Late Permian-Early Triassic (E3). The Hercynian tectonic regime in the Tassili-n-Ajjers area that was dominated by strike-slip movements during E1 and E2 tectonic phases changed into an extensional regime during E3 tectonic phase. Paleo-strain determination, folds axis distribution and the kinematic analyses of the strain field of the Hercynian active tectonic show a continuous deformation regime rather than discrete tectonic phases. Moreover, the progressive deformation regime is strongly supported by the absence of tectonic unconformities between Late Devonian/Early Carboniferous - Early Permian. At a large-scale, this continuous deformation appears as a result of a progressive closure of Rheic and western Paleotethys Oceans, and the clockwise rotation of African plate which occurred during the Hercynian/Variscan orogeny. Therefore, we could consider that the most part of Algerian Saharan platform has registered the far-field effects of this orogeny and provides a suitable illustration of an intracontinental deformation.",en,1,26911739.629494578,19,"{'Geology': 176219, 'Environmental science': 158862, 'Physics': 26707, 'Geography': 68889, 'Economics': 23134, 'Philosophy': 65747, 'History': 135024, 'Art': 52128, 'Engineering': 30276, 'Business': 44147, 'Biology': 10732, 'Psychology': 42839, 'Computer science': 39807, 'Political science': 57892, 'Sociology': 102509, 'Medicine': 14373, 'Mathematics': 35185, 'Chemistry': 11101, 'Materials science': 7313}",1.0

Here, a new multi-proxy analysis of sediments from a central Baffin Bay (BB) sediment core reveals two dominant sediment/discharge sources: 1) a detrital carbonate (BBDC; dolomite-rich) source that represents increased discharge from the NE Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) and southern Innuitian Ice Sheet (IIS), and 2) a radiogenic, felsic provenance likely from a west Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) source, although a contribution from the Baffin Island LIS cannot be ruled out. By utilising a new method for radiocarbon calibration in high latitude polar environments we provide updated age constraints on BBDC1 (14.1–13 cal ka BP) and BBDC0 (12.0–10.9 cal ka BP). This coupled with our sediment analysis shows the BBDC layers to be coincident with the Bølling-Allerød (BBDC1) and the recovery from the Younger Dryas (BBDC0). The timing of BBDC1 also further supports the theory of an ice shelf covering northern Baffin Bay from the LGM and during initial deglaciation.",en,1,0.0,1,{'Geology': 11457},0.0

This resulted in extensive magmatism, ophiolite formation, and development of a large accretionary complex that stretches north from Borneo, through Vietnam, and into China. However, much of this complex is currently submerged beneath the South China Sea, making the study of longitudinal variations in magmatic and subduction history difficult. This study focusses on the Mesozoic geology of Natuna, a remote island in the South China Sea, and uses fieldwork, whole-rock geochemistry, and zircon geochronology to determine the islands relationship to the subduction margin and how its magmatic history compares to examples from Borneo and Vietnam. Natuna records abundant subduction-related magmatism, with switches from extensional to compressional regimes driven by changes in the angle of subduction and rate of slab roll-back. Inherited zircons reveal the presence of Triassic–Early Jurassic crust beneath Natuna and indicate the formation of an Early Jurassic arc that has since eroded away. This is followed by Middle–Late Jurassic spreading in the fore-arc driven by slab-roll back and formation of the Pulau Tiga Ophiolite coeval with the deposition of cherts in the Bunguran Formation. A regional Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous slab flattening then drove abundant I-type magmatism, however, the products of this are not observed on Natuna until the Late Cretaceous. Initial I/S-type granodiorite and porphyritic granite magmatism is recorded at 85–86 Ma and formed as mantle melts rose through and became partially contaminated by previously-formed arc crust. Following this, I/S-type granites record a period of crustal thickening and increased contamination from partially melted crust at 71–75 Ma. This crustal thickening marks the end of Palaeo-Pacific subduction beneath eastern Sundaland, compression in the fore-arc, ophiolite obduction, and formation of the Natuna Accretionary Complex along the Lupar Line.",en,1,3444669.0272538685,19,"{'Geology': 133677, 'Environmental science': 81933, 'Physics': 7400, 'Geography': 14188, 'Economics': 5978, 'Philosophy': 9851, 'History': 22505, 'Business': 5284, 'Art': 7213, 'Engineering': 4066, 'Biology': 722, 'Psychology': 6337, 'Computer science': 3463, 'Political science': 8513, 'Sociology': 15890, 'Medicine': 1365, 'Mathematics': 5077, 'Chemistry': 1270, 'Materials science': 759}",1.0

Here, we compute D-1950 values at wells, interpolate them in space, and project them across time to map the moving front of modern recharge in four dimensions in the Central Valley aquifer system, California, USA. Tracers of groundwater age (tritium, carbon-14, noble gases, sulfur hexafluoride, and chlorofluorocarbons) were collected at 650 wells spatially distributed throughout the Central Valley and were fit to a lumped-parameter model that assumes a logarithmic age-depth profile in the aquifer. For samples where tritium was present (>0.3 tritium units), the model was used to predict D-1950 at wells screened above or across the modern-premodern interface (n = 484). Wells with samples where tritium was absent (≤0.3 tritium units) were used to define the depth beyond which groundwater is completely premodern (n = 166). Predicted D-1950 values were below the depth of screen bottoms for wells where groundwater is completely modern, and above the depth of screen tops for wells where groundwater is completely premodern. The interpolated surface of D-1950 is dynamic, less prone to extreme values, and produces maps with lower interpolation errors due to a higher spatial density of wells than maps based on the depth of premodern groundwater. Between 2005 and 2025, D-1950 is expected to deepen by 11 and 12 m in the northern and southern parts of the Central Valley, respectively.

This paper seeks to remedy that situation, by describing the new technologies and interpretations that arose over the past decade. The major technological advances have been in remote sending, e.g., unpiloted aerial vehicles (drones); airborne laser scanning (lidar); terrestrial laser scanning; 3D topographic surveys from Structure-from-Motion; and satellite geodesy such as D-InSAR. Advances have also been made in dating Quaternary deposits, including single-grain luminescence dating (in the laboratory), and portable optically-stimulated luminescence dating (in the field). Geophysical surveys are now a common component of neotectonic investigations, permitting a more formal, 3D integration of subsurface data with surface data. These techniques have lowered the threshold of recognition to smaller and smaller earthquakes, and allowed detection of off-fault deformation such as distributed faulting and folding. We are now collecting so much data that quality control of coseismic field measurements has become an issue, especially when assembling data sets made of old and new data.

However, volcanic records based on geological reconstructions remain incomplete. This inference is true not only for remote and sparsely populated areas like the Aleutian or Kurile-Kamchatka arcs, but also for Europe, where past large explosive events are continuously recognized in the geological record. Here we report the first age and geochemical data on the violent middle to late Pleistocene explosive eruptions from the Elbrus volcanic center (Greater Caucasus), which towers over the densely populated regions in southern Russia and Georgia. We attribute six disparate ash deposits found in the terrestrial and marine sediments along the SE European margin to the Elbrus volcanic center based on major and trace element compositions of individual shards of volcanic glass and radiogenic Sr-Nd-Pb isotope compositions of bulk tephra. We suggest that these deposits represent products of five different eruptions that were dispersed over distances of more than 150–560 km from their source. Three of four eruptions are dated at 522 ± 36, 258 ± 13, and 84.6 ± 7.4 ka by a combined zircon U–Th–Pb and (U–Th)/He approach. One sample revealed an overdispersed spectrum of single crystal (U–Th)/He dates with an average of 176 ± 40 ka. Zircon characteristics and statistical deconvolution of the geochronology data suggest that this sample contains zircon crystals from two different eruptions tentatively dated at 156.5 ± 7.7 ka and 222.8 ± 13 ka. These eruption ages represent the first recognition of a suite of large pumiceous eruptions from the Elbrus volcanic center postdating the previously known explosive activity, documented by ∼800 ka old welded tuffs. These data also provide the first geochemical and geochronological characterization of both proximal and distal Elbrus tephra glasses and contribute to the global tephra database, permitting the identification of Elbrus tephras in distal terrestrial and marine paleoenvironmental archives and hence their use as paleoclimate and archaeological markers.

We focus on a structural, rock-magnetic and geochemical investigation of a 314 Ma rhyolite dyke swarm associated with the late-orogenic Altenberg–Teplice Caldera, Bohemian Massif, eastern Variscan belt. The whole-rock major element, trace element and Nd–Pb isotope geochemistry along with the published U–Pb zircon geochronology link the extra-caldera dyke swarm with intra-caldera ignimbrites. The magnetic fabrics determined using the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility are interpreted to record a continuum from magma ascent to emplacement and eruption during sinistral shearing. The latter evidences an interplay with regional tectonics associated with the activity of crustal-scale shear zones. The sinistral kinematics and strike of the dyke swarm, the elongation of caldera intrusive units, and the kinematics of major caldera faults are consistent with the dextral Riedel shear system, where the dykes correspond to antithetic R’ or X shears. Such a kinematic configuration implies that the maximum and minimum principal stresses were oriented roughly north–south and east–west, respectively. The relation between the stress field and the caldera elongation and orientation is not typical. We suggest that a pre-existing mutually perpendicular set of cross-cutting structural lineaments largely controlled the magma chamber and caldera formation.

However, given the influence of marine diagenesis, reconstructing seawater from the isotope composition of cherts is not straightforward, resulting in ambiguity of interpretation. Here, we present a detailed isotope and petrographic investigation of deep‐sea drilled 135–40 Ma cherts with focus on the effects of marine diagenesis. We combined triple O‐isotope data with in‐situ δ′ 18 O‐ 16 OH/ 16 O measurements using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). We also provide electron microprobe maps, traditional δ′ 18 O measurements from petrographically diverse domains, and δD and H 2 O wt.% values. The bulk δ′ 18 O values range between 29‰ and 38‰ in our collection, while SIMS δ′ 18 O data reveal significant intra‐sample heterogeneities up to 6‰ related to distinct petrographic features (e.g., filled radiolarian tests) and to micrometer‐scale variations in silica forms. Further, the δ′ 18 O—Δ′ 17 O values of these seafloor‐drilled cherts plot near and under equilibrium curve. Both triple‐O and SIMS δ′ 18 O results reflect diagenesis in presence of marine pore waters at temperatures higher than ambient seawater, which is especially appreciable in cherts deposited on young oceanic crust. Despite the relatively constant δ 18 O seawater values over last 135 Ma, the marine silica spanning between 0 and 135 Ma occupies a wide compositional space in the δ′ 18 O—Δ′ 17 O rather than an equilibrium curve. The δ′ 18 O values of cherts from modern‐seafloor positively correlate with the oceanic crustal age at the time of deposition, hinting at the importance of the heat flux in the diagenetic recrystallization of marine silica.",en,1,13939366.941560416,19,"{'Chemistry': 43503, 'Economics': 17197, 'Materials science': 9625, 'Geology': 35581, 'Geography': 35732, 'History': 53014, 'Psychology': 23806, 'Biology': 28911, 'Mathematics': 11852, 'Sociology': 36307, 'Environmental science': 24133, 'Medicine': 23290, 'Philosophy': 34496, 'Computer science': 13760, 'Engineering': 2455, 'Political science': 15859, 'Art': 17656, 'Business': 5945, 'Physics': 1526}",1.0

To understand the impact of these events, a sufficiently long record of previous events is needed, which can be provided by their sedimentary deposits. A number of past events have left extensive sedimentary deposits that can be used to understand the hydrodynamics of the tsunami. The ca 8.15 ka Storegga submarine slide was a large, tsunamigenic mass movement off the coast of Norway. The resulting tsunami had estimated run‐up heights of around 10 to 20 m on the Norwegian coast, over 30 m in Shetland and 3 to 6 m on the Scottish mainland coast. New cores were taken from the Ythan Valley in North‐East Scotland, where Storegga tsunami deposits have previously been found. High‐resolution sedimentary analyses of the cores, combined with statistical (changepoint) analysis, shows signatures of multiple waves. Moreover, detailed CT scans of the erosional basal surface reveal sole marks called skim marks. Taken in conjunction with the grain size and sedimentary fabric characteristics of the tsunami deposits, this indicates that the flow exhibited a high‐concentration basal component, with an initial semi‐cohesive phase and that deposition was dominantly capacity driven. A multiple wave hypothesis is tested by creating a high‐resolution numerical model (metre‐scale) of the wave inundation, coupled to a previously published regional model. The inundation model confirms that multiple waves passed over the site in agreement with the sedimentological analysis. The sensitivity of the model to the reconstructed palaeocoastal geomorphology is quantitatively explored. It is concluded that local palaeogeomorphological reconstruction is key to understanding the hydrodynamics of a tsunami wave group in relation to its sedimentary deposit.

Most hydrothermal chimneys in the TVF are developed on the basaltic apron. This paper presents mineralogical, petrological, and geochemical data for altered basalts in and surrounding the TVF. The basalt samples can be classified into seafloor-weathered and hydrothermally altered (i.e., slightly saponite-altered, highly saponite-altered, and silicified) types. At the periphery of the TVF, the basalts have experienced seafloor weathering, which has resulted in slight mineralogical and geochemical changes. In the TVF, most basalts have interacted with diffuse low-temperature hydrothermal fluids, leading to variable degrees of saponite alteration. As the distance from the vents decreases, basaltic glass, olivine, and pyroxene are progressively replaced by saponite; Zn, Cu, Co, and U are enriched; and Ca and Mn are depleted. Magnesium, Fe, and Li have been lost due to olivine replacement by saponite, and have been gained due to pyroxene replacement by saponite. In the fluid flow conduits, the basalts have interacted with focused medium- to high-temperature fluids, which has led to the replacement of saponite by opal; depletion in Mg, Fe, Li, and rare earth elements; and enrichment in Zn, Cu, Co, and U. We propose a new hydrothermal alteration model for basalts in an ultramafic-associated vent field. Based on a comparison with mafic-hosted vent fields along mid-ocean ridges, we propose that: (1) the permeable host rocks promote lateral fluid flow, widespread mixing with cold seawater, and pervasive low-temperature hydrothermal alteration; and (2) H2S-poor reducing fluids reduce the solubility of U and inhibit the precipitation of Fe, leading to high Cu/Fe and Zn/Fe ratios, and high U concentrations. The hydrothermal alteration model for the TVF is applicable to similar vent fields and can guide exploration for seafloor massive sulfide deposits along slow-spreading ridges.",en,1,10474927.72739084,19,"{'Geography': 76482, 'Sociology': 84070, 'History': 103747, 'Geology': 50276, 'Environmental science': 42727, 'Political science': 27777, 'Philosophy': 47817, 'Business': 18125, 'Art': 31173, 'Economics': 10368, 'Psychology': 16332, 'Computer science': 16684, 'Biology': 1412, 'Mathematics': 3899, 'Engineering': 4132, 'Medicine': 4496, 'Chemistry': 626, 'Materials science': 1119, 'Physics': 389}",1.0

In this study, we image the seismogenic structure under the 1969 Ms6.4 Yangjiang intraplate earthquake within the stable South China Block with a high-resolution three-dimensional shear-wave velocity model constructed from ambient noise tomography based on a high-density seismic array. The model images relatively low velocities at a fault intersection region from the surface to at least 13 km depth in the Yangjiang seismogenic zone. Given spatial links among the faults, surface seawater, and low velocities, we interpret the low velocities to reflect the presence of seawater-filled highly-fractured rocks in fault zones. We infer that the seawater infiltration could have elevated pore pressure in the long term and lowered effective stress, as evidenced by low earthquake b values at depths of 8-13 km. This process could explain the generation of the Ms6.4 Yangjiang earthquake. We further hypothesize that the large intraplate earthquakes within stable plates are prone to occur in regional weakening regions that tend to build up stress.

Complex tectonic activity also forms a deformation zone of the Kawa Fault with a sinistral strike slip mechanism and high-angle normal faults in the mainland. On June 16, 2021 a Mw 6.0 earthquake occurred on the south coast of Seram, in Tehoru to be precise, which followed by a small tsunami wave which is thought to have been generated by an underwater landslide. This earthquake has a normal fault mechanism which is quite rare on Seram Island, however, the actual fault plane that caused the earthquake is still unknown. In this study, we investigate potential faults that may have caused the 2021 Tehoru earthquake by performing a seismicity analysis using well relocated hypocenter of the mainshock and the aftershocks sequence. We use the double-difference relocation method with the SVD algorithm performed in the hypoDD program. The results show the distribution of aftershocks that form a northeast-southwest trending lineation. The depth of the hypocenter has also improved from being dominated by fixed depth to being varied with dominance at depths of 8-14 km. An important feature of the relocation results is that the aftershocks distributed downward along a ~35° northwest-dipping plane which indicates a southwest-northeast fault orientation.

A first direct in situ U-Pb LA-ICP-MS dating of demantoid was carried out on samples with extremely low U content obtained from the Karkodinskoe and Poldnevskoe deposits, both of which are located in the Karkodin meta-ultramafic massif of the Middle Urals. In both locations, demantoid mineralization occurred within cracks in ca. 400 Ma serpentinite host rocks composed of chrysotile and antigorite, calcite and aragonite, and magnesite. Magnetite, chromite, and pyrite occur as accessory minerals. The results yielded ages of 343 ± 4 Ma and 292 ± 1 Ma for the Karkodinskoe and Poldnevskoe deposits, respectively. These ages correspond to the times of continental collision and subsequent exhumation in the Middle Urals during the Uralian orogeny. Geochronology combined with trace element data of Uralian demantoid suggests that mineralization was induced by hydrothermal processes at T < 300 °C. But trace-element signatures point to different origins for the two hydrothermal fluids. Rare-earth element (REE) patterns in garnet from Karkodinskoe deposit appear to be inherited from syenitic rocks, whereas REEs in demantoid from Poldnevskoe show affinities with skarn environments. During the collision stage, magmatic fluids that were probably associated with syenitic rocks of the Kozlinogorsky complex were re-activated leading to the re-working of the meta-ultramafic protolith of the Karkodin massif. Metamorphic processes during the exhumation stage subsequently resulted in the mobilization of hydrothermal fluids likely linked to skarns. Their migration into fractures within meta-ultramafic rocks developed the demantoid mineralization in Poldnevskoe occurrence.",en,1,0.0,0,{},0.0

Herein, we present the results of the petrography, geochemistry, and isotope geochronology of Late Neoarchean charnockites in the Daqingshan terrane at the northern margin of the North China Craton. The sources, petrogenesis, and tectonic implications of the samples obtained are determined based on their geochemical characteristics. Charnockites mainly exhibit magnesian and calc–alkaline characteristics; furthermore, they contain high amounts of light rare-earth elements, with slightly positive Eu anomalies. Analysis of zircon U–Pb dating using a sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe reveals that Hademengou–Xiwulanbulang (HDMG–XWLBL) charnockites were emplaced during the (i) Late Neoarchean (ca. 2500 Ma), with zircon εHf(t) values ranging from 1.57 to 7.81; (ii) single-stage model ages (TDM1) from 2529 to 2637 Ma; and (iii) two-stage model ages (TDM2) from 2710 to 2820 Ma. A comparative study has performed on the petrography, geochemistry, and geochronology of charnockite and granulite shown that the parent magma of the charnockites is the product of the partial melting of granulite. Combining our results with geological data pertaining to the Archaean structural evolution of the Daqingshan terrane, we speculate that the Late Neoarchean HDMG–XWLBL charnockite was formed during a subduction-related thermo-tectonic event in the northern margin of the North China Craton.KEYWORDS: Late Neoarcheancharnockitepartial meltingDaqingshan terraneNorth China Craton AcknowledgmentsWe thank Dunyi Liu and Chunyan Dong for preparing zircon mounts and Hangqiang Xie and Shouye Liu for help with SHRIMP U-Pb dating.

To better understand paleoenvironmental changes across OAE 2, 32 samples were analysed for benthic foraminiferal abundance data that represent one of the few benthic foraminiferal datasets spanning the OAE 2 in the southern high latitudes. The OAE 2 interval at Site U1516 is characterized by an interval of low CaCO3 content that contains a prominent positive Carbon Isotope Excursion (CIE). The record of the OAE 2 can be subdivided in pre OAE 2, pre max-CIE, low CaCO3, and post low CaCO3 intervals. Through the Cenomanian–Turonian boundary, we document an extreme decline in benthic foraminifera during OAE 2, that is followed by a profound repopulation event in the post low CaCO3 interval. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages indicate an outer neritic to upper bathyal depositional environment. During the pre OAE 2 and pre max-CIE intervals, calcareous deep-water gavelinellids, lingulogavelinellids and gyroidinids are dominant. In the low-carbonate interval, the microfossil record documents a substantial increase in radiolaria and foraminifera are almost absent as only three out of nine samples contain benthic foraminifera. Changes in benthic foraminiferal assemblage composition are documented in the initial low CaCO3 interval, underlying the maximum CIE and associated interferences. Comparison of the pre- and post-CIE benthic foraminiferal assemblages highlights a distinct repopulation event during the post max- CIE interval mainly represented by the conspicuous increase in abundance of agglutinated taxa and Conorboides.

The volcanic rocks occurring in the Hutti greenstone belt are bimodal in nature and contain both felsic and metabasalt. The felsic volcanic rocks in the area preserve accessory minerals like monazite, allanite, and apatite, whereas the same is absent in metabasalts. Petrographic observation of felsic volcanic rock shows corona growth of allanite and apatite (in addition to huttonite) clustering around monazite grains. This corona texture, termed allanite cluster, occurs parallel to the shear planes (C‐plane) of the felsic volcanic rock and characterizes late‐stage hydrothermal activity in the area. Texturally, monazite in the felsic volcanic rock occurs included within arsenopyrite (&lt;1 μm), and in association with apatite, allanite, and occasionally with huttonite/thorite (~10–40 μm), in which monazite grains preserve geochemical heterogeneity in both intra‐ and inter‐grains. The U–Th–Pb Total dating of monazite associated with the allanite cluster shows two age peaks (both from intra‐ and inter‐grains) at 2658 ± 17 Ma (older) and 2534 ± 38 Ma (younger), in which the older age represents the magmatic/crystallization age of the studied felsic volcanic rock overprinted by a later hydrothermal event in the study area.

In this study, we combined sedimentary and chronological methods to the reveal detailed characteristics of the mottled clay in the Huizhou Quaternary Basin. The dating results suggest that mottled clay usually developed during the late Pleistocene, overlying the fluvial deposit or embedding homogeneous aeolian yellow silt. Mottled clay has a typical bimodal frequency distribution with modal sizes at 5 and 80–90 μm, which are identical to those of the yellow silt and the underlying fluvial sand, respectively. Micro-X-ray fluorescence mapping revealed high concentrations of Fe and Si in the red and white fraction, respectively. In addition, the red fraction of mottled clay has a high hematite content, similar to loess-like yellow silt, whereas the white fraction and the underlying fluvial sediments are dominated by goethite. This sedimentary evidence together suggests that the mottled clay could be an admixture of aeolian yellow silt and the underlying fluvial sand. Furthermore, diverse deformed structures (e.g., fragmented structures, sand veins, sand dykes and flame structures) were observed in mottled clay. Therefore, we suggest that the mottled clay structure in the Huizhou Basin is a product of liquefaction-induced SSDS. Tectonic activity was considered to have triggered the liquefaction and SSDS, which is supported by the close spatial relationship between the mottled clay and regional faults.

Repeatedly described under different names, taxonomic work from the 1990's argued for the inclusion of several morphologically similar ichnogenera in Protovirgularia. A critical review of the type specimens of the included ichnospecies and their synonyms confirms the validity of five ichnospecies by applying uniform ichnotaxobases. A morphometric analysis of key parameters assists in the distinction of these ichnospecies. The type ichnospecies Protovirgularia dichotoma, generally regarded as a trail, is better qualified as a trackway, in contrast to the remaining ichnospecies, which represent shallow burrows. Beside the habitus of the burrow, the shape, density and orientation of its sediment pads (or chevrons) and their ornamentation allow the distinction of P. pennata, P. rugosa, P. longespicata and P. bifurcata. Compound forms resulting from locomotion and resting are rejected as an ichnotaxobase. The enigmatic nature of Protovirgularia led to speculations about its origin, including various body-fossil interpretations (e.g., sea pens and annelids). Now widely accepted as a trace fossil, the interpretation of its producer varied and became oversimplified based on an experiment made with protobranch bivalves.

https://openalex.org/W4322099138,2023,Geology,"How high can mechanical stresses be within lithospheric materials?Thanks to plate tectonics, the Earth lithosphere is composed of very different lithologies, most of which consisting of peridotites, usually covered by either oceanic or continental crust. Depending on several parameters including composition, pressure, temperature, and strain rate, lithospheric materials can deform smoothly and silently or generate seismic ruptures. Collision belts and subduction systems, including subducted materials being heated and sheared in the mantle transition zone, are characterized by intense seismicity; in contrast, the bottom of lithospheric plates, known as lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB), is not associated with any seismicity, giving the impression that oceanic plates have the intrinsic ability to maintain their basal stress at relatively low values. Comparing results from experimental geophysics, field geology, geodynamics modelling and seismology, I discuss the representativity of experimental findings and potential consequences on our understanding of the rheology of the lithosphere.The idea that lithospheric materials at intermediate depths or deeper cannot support high deviatoric stresses is still supported by many studies in geosciences or physics. Plenty of authors start by recalling that brittle failure cannot occur at high pressure, and thus conclude that deep earthquakes and their shallow counterparts should consist of totally different events relying on totally different physical processes. Yet, deep seismicity is characterized by double-couple mechanisms and thus is an actual proof of seismic ruptures at great depths. Here I recall achievements from experiments under synchrotron radiation, suggesting that differential stresses can reach several gigapascals within subducting slabs at intermediate depths (30-300 km). In either peridotites or lawsonite blueschists, high-energy X-rays reveal differential stresses above 2 GPa for confining pressures of 1-1.5 GPa, and reaching &amp;#8776; 3 GPa for confining pressures of 2.5-3.5 GPa. This is further supported by both field geology studies and numerical modelling.While mean stresses in seismogenic zones exhibit severe deviations from lithostatic pressure, the base of lithospheric plates deforms in a way that never triggers seismicity. The coupling between lithospheric plates and the underlying asthenosphere is still a matter of debate. According to global dynamics modelling, a basal shear stress as low as only 10-100 MPa would suffice to allow decoupling at the LAB. While partial melting has recently been favoured as an explanation for plate motion, experimental results on an analogue (germanium peridotite) suggest a solid-state lubrication process, involving grain-boundary disordering,&amp;#160;and would confirm that mechanical stresses do not exceed 200 MPa at the LAB (60-120 km).",en,1,26363628.655822,19,"{'Environmental science': 155156, 'Geography': 68265, 'Economics': 23242, 'Philosophy': 66089, 'History': 134584, 'Geology': 134470, 'Art': 52242, 'Engineering': 22912, 'Business': 43879, 'Biology': 10732, 'Psychology': 42839, 'Computer science': 39756, 'Political science': 57930, 'Sociology': 101904, 'Physics': 19526, 'Medicine': 14373, 'Mathematics': 34534, 'Chemistry': 11044, 'Materials science': 7277}",1.0

To understand erosion and accretion processes it is critical to map the ILMS sediments at high spatiotemporal resolution. Here we used two geophysical methods, waterborne electrical resistivity imaging (wERI) and sub-bottom profiling (SBP), ground-truthed by hydraulic jet probing and historic borings, to map the thickness of unconsolidated sediments along two reaches of the ILMS. These geophysical surveys show that the sediments have not undergone deformation, and the thickness of the unconsolidated sandy material ranges between 4 and 5 m over semiconsolidated clay and bedrock. Both geophysical methods agree with jet probe results which provide direct evidence of loose, sandy sediments up to depths of 4 to 5 m below the lakebed. The wERI shows more detailed variation in the sediment and bedrock topography than the other methods. Overall, the geophysical methods, particularly the wERI, appear to be effective tools to map the sediment structure along the ILMS at high spatial resolution. Considering the relatively low cost of the operation of geophysical surveys, simplicity of operation and data analyses, wERI and SBP show promising potential for comprehensive mapping of the ILMS.

Given a PRR and a time limit $\kappa$, we consider the classical concept of tail probability $\Pr[T \ge \kappa]$, i.e., the probability that the randomized runtime $T$ of the PRR exceeds the time limit $\kappa$. Our focus is the formal analysis of tail bounds that aims at finding a tight asymptotic upper bound $u \geq \Pr[T\ge\kappa]$ in the time limit $\kappa$. To address this problem, the classical and most well-known approach is the cookbook method by Karp (JACM 1994), while other approaches are mostly limited to deriving tail bounds of specific PRRs via involved custom analysis. In this work, we propose a novel approach for deriving exponentially-decreasing tail bounds (a common type of tail bounds) for PRRs whose preprocessing time and random passed sizes observe discrete or (piecewise) uniform distribution and whose recursive call is either a single procedure call or a divide-and-conquer. We first establish a theoretical approach via Markov's inequality, and then instantiate the theoretical approach with a template-based algorithmic approach via a refined treatment of exponentiation. Experimental evaluation shows that our algorithmic approach is capable of deriving tail bounds that are (i) asymptotically tighter than Karp's method, (ii) match the best-known manually-derived asymptotic tail bound for QuickSelect, and (iii) is only slightly worse (with a $\log\log n$ factor) than the manually-proven optimal asymptotic tail bound for QuickSort. Moreover, our algorithmic approach handles all examples (including realistic PRRs such as QuickSort, QuickSelect, DiameterComputation, etc.) in less than 0.1 seconds, showing that our approach is efficient in practice.",en,1,0.0,0,{},0.0

Forecasting with bayesian vector autoregressions-five years of experience. J Business Economic Statist.1986;4(1):25–38.] has been very successful in multivariate time series modelling, providing better forecasting performance. However, the conventional Minnesota prior for BVAR depends only on the latest lag; in turn, it is not suitable for multivariate long memory time series forecasting. This study extends BVAR to (possibly) high-dimensional long memory time series. To this end, we incorporate a vector heterogeneous autoregressive (VHAR) structure to accommodate long-term persistence and impose priors on distant lags as well. Our proposed Bayesian VHAR (BVHAR) models, the so-called BVHAR-S and BVHAR-L, are easy to implement by using the Normal-inverse-Wishart prior and added dummy variable approach of [Bańbura M, Giannone D, Reichlin L.

https://openalex.org/W4319081195,2023,Mathematics,"A Bivariate Extension to Exponentiated Inverse Flexible Weibull Distribution: Shock Model, Features, and Inference to Model Asymmetric DataThe primary objective of this article was to introduce a new probabilistic model for the discussion and analysis of random covariates. The introduced model was derived based on the Marshall–Olkin shock model. After proposing the mathematical form of the new bivariate model, some of its distributional properties, including joint probability distribution, joint reliability distribution, joint reversed (hazard) rate distribution, marginal probability density function, conditional probability density function, moments, and distributions for both Y=max{X1,X2} and W=min{X1,X2}, were investigated. This novel model can be applied to discuss and evaluate symmetric and asymmetric data under various kinds of dispersion. Moreover, it can be used as a probability approach to analyze different shapes of hazard rates. The maximum likelihood approach was utilized for estimating the parameters of the bivariate model. A simulation study was carried out to assess the performance of the parameters, and it was noted that the maximum likelihood technique can be used to generate consistent estimators. Finally, two real datasets were analyzed to illustrate the notability of the novel bivariate distribution, and it was found that the suggested distribution provided a better fit than the competitive bivariate models.",en,1,18292154.24739845,19,"{'Physics': 37458, 'Mathematics': 69830, 'Business': 32976, 'History': 75377, 'Political science': 55765, 'Engineering': 11791, 'Environmental science': 92435, 'Geography': 59423, 'Computer science': 24137, 'Materials science': 9729, 'Psychology': 27402, 'Sociology': 63415, 'Economics': 28031, 'Philosophy': 51034, 'Art': 31074, 'Chemistry': 4314, 'Biology': 1746, 'Medicine': 2440, 'Geology': 1700}",1.0

Material and Methods: A simulation study was conducted where random numbers were generated from a bivariate standard normal distribution with correlations of 0.5 and 0.9. Sample sizes were set at 30, 50, 100, 150 and 200. Random numbers were equally spaced and coded as 3×3, 4×4 and 5×5 cross-tabulations, respectively. The robustness of Pearson’s, Spearman's rank, Kendall's tau-b, Kendall's tau-c, Goodman-Kruskal’s gamma and Somer's d coefficients were compared under different experimental conditions consisting of combinations of specified population correlation degrees, table dimensions and sample sizes. Results: The Goodman-Kruskal’s gamma coefficient gave the closest result to the relationship levels set at the beginning of the study in all experimental conditions. However, after a certain level, it was negatively affected by the increase in table dimension and sample size. Kendall's tau-b and tau-c coefficients were furthest from the actual degree of the association. Spearman's rank correlation was more robust than Kendall's tau-b, Kendall's tau-c and Somer's d coefficients.

https://openalex.org/W4285685345,2023,Mathematics,"On the algorithmic complexity of determining the AVD and NSD chromatic indices of graphsA proper k-edge-colouring ϕ of a graph G is an assignment of colours from {1,…,k} to the edges of G such that no two adjacent edges receive the same colour. If, additionally, ϕ guarantees that no two adjacent vertices of G are incident to the same sets or sums of colours, then ϕ is called an AVD or NSD edge-colouring, respectively (the abbreviations AVD and NSD standing for “adjacent vertex distinguishing” and “neighbour sum distinguishing”). The chromatic index χ′(G) of G is the smallest k such that proper k-edge-colourings of G exist. Similarly, the AVD and NSD chromatic indices χAVD′(G) and χNSD′(G) of G are the smallest k such that AVD and NSD k-edge-colourings of G exist, respectively. These chromatic parameters are quite related, as we always have χNSD′(G)≥χAVD′(G)≥χ′(G). By a well-known result of Vizing, we know that, for any graph G, we must have χ′(G)∈{Δ(G),Δ(G)+1}. Still, determining χ′(G) is NP-hard in general. Regarding χAVD′(G) and χNSD′(G), it is conjectured that, in general, they should always lie in {Δ(G),Δ(G)+1,Δ(G)+2}. In this work, we prove that determining whether a given graph G has AVD or NSD chromatic index Δ(G) is NP-hard for every Δ(G)≥3. We also prove that, for a given graph G, determining whether the AVD or NSD chromatic index is Δ(G)+1 is NP-hard for every Δ(G)≥3. Through other NP-hardness results, we also establish that there are infinitely many graphs for which the AVD and NSD chromatic indices are different. We actually come up, for every k≥4, with infinitely many graphs with maximum degree k, AVD chromatic index k, and NSD chromatic index k+1, and similarly, for every k≥3, with infinitely many graphs with maximum degree k, AVD chromatic index k+1, and NSD chromatic index k+2.

Without determining its origin, our approach is to explain our gravity theory based on Einstein’s relativity theory and the behavior of space-time flow. This influx occurs continuously throughout all of space-time, making the universe expand. Our theory presents two kinds of expansion: (PUE) space-time primary universal expansion and the (VME) virtual matter expansion that occurs with the interaction of space-time with the matter. The internal space-time in atoms produces a virtual slight broadening of the matter’s atoms. From our frame of reference, we can only distinguish the perturbation that occurs to the (PUE) primary universal expansion if it encounters matter. This perturbation finally is restored by a Gaussian distribution at the spherical environment. We call it the (STD) Space-time accelerated displacement. It is the inertial-gravity field. Thus, matter expands by the superposition of atoms (molecules). The accelerated expansion increases proportionally to the number of atoms that radially constitute matter. The effect is manifested immensely increased in the surface of the stellar objects. Then the surface of the massive stellar objects pushes and displaces the object’s external surrounding space-time. The acceleration of the (STD) space-time displacement decreases with the radius squared from the center of mass as it is distributed concentrically. The acceleration we feel at the Earth’s surface is permanently fixed, because when space expands, time also proportionally expands. The associated speed (ds/dt) is immersed in the accelerated expansion of space-time; the time base is the same as the acceleration of the PUE (space-time primary universal expansion) (d2s/dt2). Otherwise, in a short time, this acceleration and its associated velocity would reach the speed of light. Our theory introduces a different concept: “repulsion instead of attraction”. The expansion of space-time produces gravity instead of counteracting it. Finally, we explain using this gravity theory: Earth’s oceans, creating tidal bulges on opposite sides of the planet.",en,1,51884.12130339508,3,"{'Physics': 29410, 'Mathematics': 4368, 'Psychology': 3990}",1.0

They demonstrate such common features of all incommensurate electronic crystals as a spectacular non-linear conduction by means of the collective sliding and susceptibility to the electric field. These phenomena ultimately require for emergence of static and transient topological defects: there are dislocations as space vortices and space-time vortices known as phase slip centers, i.e., a kind of instantons. Dislocations are statically built-in under a transverse electric field; their sweeping provides a conversion among the normal carriers and condensate which ensures the onset of the collective sliding. A special realization in a high magnetic field, when the density wave is driven by the Hall voltage, originated by quantized normal carriers, reveals the dynamic vorticity serving to annihilate compensating normal and collective currents. Spin density waves, with their rich multiplicative order parameter, bring to life complex objects with half-integer topologically bound vorticities in charge and spin degrees of freedom. We present the basic concepts and modelling results of the stationary states and their transient dynamics involving vorticity.

Since the plasma frequency of a metamaterial is determined by its unit cell, and is thus a bulk property, a metamaterial resonator of any frequency can be made arbitrarily large, in contrast to a microwave cavity which incurs a steep penalty in volume with increasing frequency. To assess the actual potential of this concept as a practical dark matter haloscope, the basic properties of wire array metamaterials have been investigated through an extensive series of S 21 measurements in the 10 GHz range. This report presents some new systematics of wire array metamaterials themselves including the approach to full plasmonic behavior, the applicability of the semianalytic theory of Belov, and estimates of the loss term which bode favorably for the plasmonic haloscope application.

The internal Schwarzschild metric is used for this model, which is justified by the fact that spherically-symmetric empty spaces in the Universe are effectively surrounded by a shell of infinite mass (the surrounding Universe and in particular, the infinitely dense mass at the Big Bang). Thus the metric for the empty spaces must be described by the Schwarzschild metric according to Birkhoff&amp;rsquo;s theorem. Since the shell&amp;rsquo;s mass is infinite, the external solution cannot describe this spacetime and therefore the internal Schwarzschild solution must be the correct metric for this spacetime. The important insight here is that the source of the metric is not at r = 0, but that the event horizon is the metric source in both cases, representing a location/time of infinite density. This is supported by looking at the internal geometry in Kruskal coordinates where the event horizon surrounds the vacuum at an infinite distance, meaning the Schwarzschild radius, and therefore mass, of the source shell is infinite. The full spatial homogeneity of the internal metric is also demonstrated by visualizing at the Schwarzschild geometry (with 2 spatial dimensions and the time dimension) in Kruskal coordinates. The model predicts both a Universe and Anti-Universe moving in opposite directions of time undergoing an expansion phase, followed by a collapsing phase. Using only the current coordinate age of the Universe and transition redshift, it predicts the accelerated expansion and it is shown that its Hubble diagram fits currently available supernova and quasar data as well as predicting a Hubble constant H0 &amp;asymp; 71.6km/s/M pc. The angular term of the metric describes time dilation caused by the relativistic kinematic precession effect known as Thomas Precession which can be interpreted as spin about the time dimension.

To investigate the acceleration response of the pipeline and pressure pulsation response of fluid, the vibration tests of the pipeline under base excitation, fluid fluctuation excitation, and multi-excitation are conducted. A set of test bench and test schemes of pipeline system under multi-excitation are designed. The test data are collected by a piezo-electric pressure sensor and a three-direction acceleration sensor. By analyzing the test data, the following results can be obtained: Under base excitation, the internal fluid still has a weak pressure pulsation response even without fluid fluctuation excitation. However, the pressure pulsation response remains unchanged with the increase of base excitation amplitude. Under fluid fluctuation excitation, the amplitudes of vibration responses at fluid fundamental frequency fp increase with the increase of pump pressure except at 9 MPa and 15 MPa. The natural frequency of the pipeline is close to 3fp when the pump pressure is 9 MPa and 15 MPa, respectively, and the pipeline system will have resonance. Under multi-excitation, the amplitudes of vibration responses are close to the superimposed amplitudes of two single source excitations at fb = 175 Hz and fp = 298 Hz. The vibration responses appear to beat vibration at fb = 298 Hz and fp = 297.6 Hz. The relevant test scheme and test data analysis adopted in this paper have important reference values for the in-depth study of pipeline vibration under multi-excitation and engineering practice.",en,1,0.0,0,{},0.0

Such models are required for an accurate description of neutron star phenomenology, and binary neutron star mergers in particular. In fact, the advent of multi-messenger astronomy offers exciting prospects for exploring the extreme physics at play during such cosmic fireworks. We first focus on modelling dissipative fluids in relativity, and explore the arguably unique model that is ideally suited for describing dissipative multi-fluids in General Relativity. Modelling single fluids in relativity is already a hard task, but for neutron stars it is easy to argue that we need to understand even more complicated settings: the presence of superfluid/superconducting mixtures, for example, means that we need to go beyond single-fluid descriptions. We then consider turbulent flows and focus on how to perform ""filtering"" in a curved spacetime setting. We do so as most recent turbulent models in a Newtonian setting are based on the notion of spatial filtering. As the same strategy is beginning to be applied in numerical relativity, we focus on the foundational underpinnings and propose a novel scheme for carrying out filtering, ensuring consistency with the tenets of General Relativity. Finally, we discuss two applications of relevance for binary neutron star mergers. We focus on the modelling of ($\beta$-)reactions in neutron star simulations, and provide a discussion of the magneto-rotational instability that is suited to highly dynamical environments like mergers.

As a result, gravity-like effects appear in between entangled particles, whether they be real or virtual. Long range, massless gravity results from entanglement of massless virtual particles. Entanglement of massive virtual particles leads to massive gravity contributions at very smalls scales. Multi-folds mechanisms also result in a spacetime that is discrete, with a random walk fractal structure, and non-commutative geometry that is Lorentz invariant, and where spacetime nodes and particles can be modeled with microscopic black holes. All these recover General Relativity (GR) at large scales, and semi-classical models remain valid till smaller scale than usually expected. Gravity can therefore be added to the Standard Model resulting into what we define as SMG. This can contribute to resolving several open issues with the Standard Model without New Physics other than gravity, i.e. no new particles or forces, or with the standard cosmological model (ΛCDM), in terms of dark matter and dark energy. Multi-folds can be encountered in GR at Plank scales, in spacetime quantization starting from the Hilbert Einstein action, and in the equivalence principle of suitable quantum reference frames in relational quantum physics. Conversely, GR and Quantum physics can be recovered through different paths from multi-fold spacetime reconstruction and the W-type multi-fold hypothesis. In a multi-fold universe, GR and Quantum Physics are not incompatible, they are just different facets of multi-fold mechanisms, something that neither theory can well model.In QFTs, scattering amplitudes are perturbatively computed using Feynman diagrams. Recent work showed that classical scattering of massive or charged particles, or objects, and resulting wave radiation, are classically fully characterized by up to the five-point tree-level diagrams. All the loop and other order diagrams contribute quantum corrections. We explain such results in multi-fold universes. Furthermore, doing so we detail how gravitons are unphysical quasi-particles, a key difference with gauge interactions that also results into gravity QFT/EFT non renormalizability. Yang Mills theory and gravity have many commonalities, including the double copy behavior in scattering amplitude. Besides relating this behavior to Kaluza Klein, and space time matter induction, the paper shows not only how double copy is compatible with multi-fold mechanisms, but also argues that it implies the multi-fold emergence of gravity from (virtual) entangled particle pairs, which is at the core of the multi-fold mechanisms. Furthermore, gravity contains Yang Mills, as implication of its square root of scattering amplitudes. Also, it explains why one therefore also can derive, under the right conditions, Yang Mills from the Hilbert Einstein action, as are encountered by superstrings when adding a conformance condition. As announced by the title, we show how these results imply that GR is obtained, at the scale of the SM, from the kinematics of SM, i.e., from Yang Mills, (massless) particles. It validates one of the a priori arbitrarily imposed axiom of the multi-fold theory, and provides a microscopic explanation for the double copy behavior, which so far is unjustified in conventional QFT or superstrings. This way, the paper explains how Yang Mills contains gravity / GR, and, conversely, quantum gravity / GR contains Yang Mills, so that the E/G conjecture is satisfied.

Here, we study the ion-neutral drift velocity in a suite of chemodynamical, non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD), two-dimensional axisymmetric simulations of prestellar cores where we alter the temperature, cosmic-ray ionization rate, visual extinction, mass-to-flux ratio, and chemical evolution. Subsequently, we perform a number of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) radiative-transfer calculations considering various idealized and non-idealized scenarios in order to assess which factor (chemistry, radiative transfer, and/or observational difficulties) is the most challenging to overcome in our efforts to detect the ion-neutral drift velocity. We find that temperature has a significant effect in the amplitude of the drift velocity with the coldest modelled cores (T = 6 K) exhibiting drift velocities comparable to the sound speed. Against expectations, we find that in idealized scenarios (where two species are perfectly chemically co-evolving) the drift velocity ‘survives’ radiative-transfer effects and can in principle be observed. However, we find that observational challenges and chemical effects can significantly hinder our view of the ion-neutral drift velocity.

In this paper, the effects of moderate-energy (about 20 to 40 keV) HEs on the evolution of two-dimensional single-mode ablative Rayleigh–Taylor instability (ARTI) are studied through numerical simulations with a multigroup diffusion model in which the HE population is treated as a high-energy group launched from the boundary. With HEs present, it is found that ARTI linear growth rates are reduced even though the acceleration of the implosion shell is enhanced by HEs. The reduction in the linear growth rate is owing to the increase in the ablation velocity and the density scale length, and this stabilization effect is greater in the shorter-wavelength modes and/or higher-energy HE cases. The ARTI linear growth does not get mitigated monotonically as the HE number density increases for a given fixed HE kinetic energy.

The compressive and flexural strengths of pressed geopolymer reached 114.2 and 29.9 MPa after 28 d, higher than that of cast geopolymer (60.0 and 6.2 MPa, respectively). The strength reduction of pressed geopolymer (31.7%) after the accelerated efflorescence test was lower than that of cast geopolymer (60.2%). The ecological analysis inferred that pressed geopolymer was ecologically superior to the casting method in terms of embodied energy (EE) and embodied carbon dioxide emission (ECO2), in which 50% and 59% of reductions are acquired. Besides, the embodied carbon index (ECI) of pressed geopolymer was about 21% of cast geopolymer.",en,1,0.0,0,{},0.0

Optimizing the TPUs' structure is a useful method to adjustable uneven distribution of hard segments and enhance the performance of TPUs. In this work, a chain extender (BMB) embedded in carbamate‐derive units was successfully synthesized by 4,4′‐diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) and 1,4‐butanediol (BDO). Using BMB and as chain extender, a modified BMB‐TPU was prepared, and its properties were systematically evaluated. Compared with conventional thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer (BDO‐TPU), BMB‐TPU had a regular structure with uniform hard segments, narrower molecular weight distribution and stronger intra/inter‐chain hydrogen bonding interactions, and thus better microphase separation. The BMB‐TPU exhibited an excellent tensile strength of 35 MPa, 46% higher than 24 MPa for the control BDO‐TPU. Moreover, the heat resistance of BMB‐TPU was also reinforced compared to BDO‐TPU, with an increase of 7.2°C for the degradation temperature of 5% loss and 9.6°C for the viscous flow transition temperature.

Scanning electron microscope results revealed that the dispersion and filling effect of LGPs can improve the flowability of the resin, reducing the aggregation and shrinkage of the resin on the glass fabric surface, thereby facilitating better resin infiltration and coverage of the glass fabric surface. From the spectrum analysis, the binding of LGPs with epoxy resin was the physical combination, without new chemical groups generated during the curing process. The addition of LGPs improved the ratio of the crystalline phases in the composites, from 30.00% of the GF/epoxy to 57.50% of the GF/epoxy@2.2LGPs. Mechanical properties indicated that the composites exhibited greater tensile strength than pure GF, which progressively increased with increasing LGPs content until it reached 1.5 wt%, then the tensile strength starts to decrease. And the GF/epoxy@1.5 LGPs exhibited 136% enhancement in tensile strength compared to other carbon fillers reinforced composites, which achieved a satisfactory enhancement under relatively low loading content. Highlights The effect of the large‐size graphene platelets (LGPs) on the properties of glass fabric (GF)/epoxy composites.

Nevertheless, low elasticity and difficulties related to a high reduction in mechanical properties at even slightly elevated temperatures seem to limit this potential, due to existing fire safety requirements for buildings. Basalt FRP, which is the subject of this experimental study, is a relatively new type of non-metallic bars, and their environmental friendliness has been underlined in previous studies. The aim of this study is to determine the mechanical properties of BFRP bars, such as tensile and compressive strength and elasticity modulus, at normal and elevated temperatures up to 200 &deg;C. The medium values of compressive strength at room temperature were in the range of 441.2&ndash;466.8 MPa, and it was significantly lower than the tensile strength (930.5&ndash;1121.3 MPa). Additionally, low values of elasticity modulus, especially when comparing to steel bars (typically about 210 GPa), were found in both compression (mean values: 31.0&ndash;38.4 GPa) and tension (mean values: 43.3&ndash;44.6 GPa). Low elasticity modulus may lead to difficulties with excessive deflections and crack widths, when designing bent elements with such reinforcement.

The cutting material is obtained by hot pressing by direct transmission of electric current. The developed cutting material is characterised by high physical and mechanical properties, the absence of fusible components that could reduce high-temperature strength, and fracture toughness. In addition, it shows high efficiency in the processing of high-hard steels and ceramics, has high hardness, strength of interfacial and intergranular boundaries, high dispersion and uniform distribution of structural components, and a minimum size of defects that could be sources of fracture. Comparative studies of various cutting ceramic materials show that the main reasons for the high wear resistance of oxide-carbide ceramics, in particular the resulting nanocomposite, in steel processing are their fine-grained structure, as well as the substructural and dispersed strengthening mechanism. In white Al2O3 ceramics, the grains contain dislocations, i.e., the grains are not capable to store the deformation energy, which results in microfracture of Al2O3 grains in the surface layers of the tool. It follows that an increase in the resistance to brittle fracture of oxide-carbide ceramics and the stability of its cutting properties could be achieved by reducing the grain size of the matrix, which is observed when using additives in the form of carbides (TiC, WC, SiC). It was found, the optimal sintering temperature of the mixture under pressure is equals to 1600 °C. At a temperature of 1550 °C, the holding time is not sufficient, and at 1650 °C, the temperature of the Al2O3–WC interfacial interaction is exceeded, which could lead to the formation of CO and closed porosity. The pressing pressure is limited by the characteristics of graphite and equals 50 MPa. The maximum pressure is applied only when the maximum pressing temperature is reached to complete degassing of sorbed gases. It has been determined that the grain size of the structural components of ceramics in the range of 2...5 µm is not optimal and is formed not during the sintering process, but during the preparation of the mixture for hot pressing.",en,1,458655.9314781798,16,"{'Materials science': 129584, 'Chemistry': 11853, 'Engineering': 1659, 'Economics': 36, 'Geology': 76, 'History': 57, 'Geography': 27, 'Sociology': 197, 'Mathematics': 19, 'Art': 38, 'Environmental science': 76, 'Political science': 37, 'Psychology': 18, 'Medicine': 19, 'Physics': 75, 'Business': 19}",1.0

The machining method of milling was used to compare and analyze the surface quality, cutting force, tool wear, and chip shape of the specimens under different machining processes. The results have shown that the actual dimensions of the original holes formed by L-PBF are generally smaller than the theoretical ones, mainly due to the collapsed areas and powder adhesion zones. The best machining quality of the hole structure was obtained with the feed rate of 20 mm/min and the MQL-assisted process. The burr was relatively minimal, with an average dimensional error of only 77 μm. The overall cutting forces are high and fluctuate during dry cutting.

At a feed rate of 10 mm/min, the overall maximum radial cutting force is reduced by 72 %, and the overall average axial cutting force is reduced by 35 %. At a feed rate of 30 mm/min, the overall maximum axial cutting force is reduced by 37 %. The tool wear was severe, and many chips adhered to the tool under dry-cutting conditions.

One of the recommended ways to minimize these changes is the application of laser beam welding (LBW) as a lower heat input technology. Hence, this work compares and investigates the effects of laser beam welding on the properties of weld joints made of the steels S690QL, S960QL, S1100QL, S700MC, S960MC, and S1100MC.

When individual steels are compared, more obvious changes in the softening effect, grain growth, and the extent of the coarse-grain HAZ (CGHAZ) are evident. According to measured values it has been demonstrated that as the amount of Nb, V, and Ti in material decreases, the grain size in the coarse-grain HAZ (CGHAZ) and the zones’ overall width increases. It was also further demonstrated that the Cr and Mo content had a significant impact on the weld metal's hardness in laser-welded weld joints.

OpenAI, 2022https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/Date accessed: December 27, 2022Google Scholar Released to the public in November, 2022, ChatGPT is based on artificial intelligence (AI) technology and trained on data from the internet written by humans, including conversations. This AI-powered chatbot has vast capabilities ranging from poem composition, essay writing, solving coding issues, and explanation of complex concepts including “how can we fix the UK National Health Service?” Some consider that ChatGPT has advanced the online search to the next level;2Grant N Mets C A new chat bot is a code red for Google's search business.

Although still only a research preview, ChatGPT has shown impressive performance across multiple use cases. One potential area of ChatGPT's application could be to generate discharge summaries. Composition of high-quality discharge summaries containing the requisite information can be time consuming, with the burden usually falling on junior doctors. Therefore, when balanced against clinical commitments, discharge summaries are often left under-prioritised resulting in delays in patients' discharges or insufficient discharge summaries, which not only places pressure on an already stretched junior doctor workforce, but also presents potential patient safety issues in the transition of care from secondary to primary care.3Allen J Hutchinson AM Brown R Livingston PM Quality care outcomes following transitional care interventions for older people from hospital to home: a systematic review.BMC Health Serv Res. 2014; 14: 346Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar ChatGPT allows doctors to input a brief of the specific information to include, concepts to elaborate on, and guidance to explain, outputting a formal discharge summary in a matter of seconds (panel). Discharge summaries are an obvious choice for this technology because of their largely standardised format; this standardisation has previously been recognised through the creation of templates—eg, from the Royal College of Physicians.4Royal College of PhysiciansImproving discharge summaries—learning resource materials. RCP, London2021https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/guidelines-policy/improving-discharge-summaries-learning-resource-materialsDate accessed: December 27, 2022Google Scholar Automation of this process could therefore ease the work burden upon junior doctors allowing more time for the delivery of patient care and the seeking of training opportunities in often roles centered on service provision. ChatGPT could also improve the quality of the discharge summaries themselves, with previous literature showing discharge summaries that are written through traditional means often missing details.5Earnshaw CH Pedersen A Evans J Cross T Gaillemin O Vilches-Moraga A Improving the quality of discharge summaries through a direct feedback system.Future Healthc J. 2020; 7: 149-154Crossref PubMed Google ScholarPanelChatGPT's response to a simple discharge summary requestPrompt“Write me a discharge summary for John Doe, a 70-year-old man who has had a total hip replacement 5 days ago and now can leave hospital to go home.”Response *Although this summary is likely to be accurate for most patients, the additional information that was not included in the prompt was automatically generated by ChatGPT, highlighting the need for manual checking by clinical staff before finalisation. *Although this summary is likely to be accurate for most patients, the additional information that was not included in the prompt was automatically generated by ChatGPT, highlighting the need for manual checking by clinical staff before finalisation.“Patient: John DoeAge: 70 years oldDate of admission: [date]Date of discharge: [date]Reason for Admission: Total hip replacement surgerySummary of Hospital Course:Mr Doe was admitted to the hospital on [date] for a total hip replacement surgery.

Signed, [physician's name]” Although ChatGPT offers significant promise, deployment into clinical practice will require multiple barriers to be overcome. First, ChatGPT depends on the data it receives and therefore still necessitates salient information to be manually inputted. Future iterations might allow automatic scraping of data from the patient's electronic health record without the need for manual inputting of a brief. This practice, however, presents significant issues with respect to data governance. Previous use of AI within health care has been associated with failings that significantly damage patients' trust6Powles J Hodson H Google DeepMind and healthcare in an age of algorithms.Health Technol. 2017; 7: 351-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar and therefore care must be taken around data storage and access. Acceptability of this technology, from patients in particular, must be considered. The concern that automation might lead to depersonalisation of care could lead to resistance to this technology. Pilot trial data is therefore necessary to gather stakeholder views and ultimately show improvements in efficiency and quality of processes. Finally, the consequences of technology failure must be considered. Although asking trivial questions to a chatbot at home might have few consequences, incorrect or inadequate information concerning medication changes or follow-up can greatly affect patient care. Therefore, although ChatGPT can be considered as a first step in the writing process, manual checking of its output by a doctor will be required before completion. ChatGPT demonstrates the power of this next generation of chatbots powered by large language models. Although the use of chatbots within health care is by no means novel, having previously been applied to areas such as triage,7Baker A Perov Y Middleton K et al.A comparison of artificial intelligence and human doctors for the purpose of triage and diagnosis.Front Artif Intell. 2020; 3543405Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar this next generation aims to advance the field significantly through its generative capacities. Health care is an industry that has significant scope for automation, especially in areas of documentation. We should be reactive to these advances in technology and explore potential use cases and feasibility of using chatbots such as ChatGPT across diverse areas in health care. Proactive early adoption of this technology at a central level might also reduce the risk of issues in the future; parallels can be drawn with interoperability issues due to differing electronic health records adopted at a local level.8Centre For Public ImpactThe electronic health records system in the UK.https://www.centreforpublicimpact.org/case-study/electronic-health-records-system-uk/Date accessed: December 27, 2022Google Scholar The question for the future will be how, not if, we adopt this technology.

https://openalex.org/W4387753622,2023,Environmental science,"Developing the Next Generation of Clinician ScientistsClinician scientists are typically defined as clinically trained and qualified health care providers engaged in research and discovery. Their essential translational role in connecting biomedical research advances to improvements in human health is clear from past achievements. Some of the most important advances driven by clinician scientists include vaccinations, antibiotics, modern cataract surgery, and gene therapies, among many others. Nevertheless, clinician scientists currently comprise an estimated 1.5 to 2% of the total population of clinicians. Furthermore, this proportion is shrinking and has been since the 1970s. The aging academic workforce and economic variables are but two contributing factors in the declining population of clinician scientists. Most recently, the COVID-19 global pandemic has also contributed to further attrition. There is a need to develop the next generation of clinician scientists, to create the future workforce who will continue to drive innovation through discoveries in research and clinical practice. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has created numerous programs to attract, develop, and retain potential future clinician scientists. Because clinician scientists may train up to 20 years to become independent investigators, there are several training programs and early career awards to help support early-career investigators. This support includes loan repayment programs (https://www.lrp.nih.gov), individual research career development awards (K08, K23, K99/R00), fellowship grants (F30, F31), and institutional training grants (K12, T35, T32). For those interested in pursuing a career as a clinician scientist, there are many resources to support that career path. NEW R38 CLINICIAN SCIENCE TRAINING PROGRAM On June 27, 2023, the National Eye Institute recently added a new funding resource to support clinician scientist development when it became a participating sponsor of an existing training program. This R38 institutional training program is called Stimulating Access to Research in Residency, or StARR, and the full request for applications and instructions to apply can be found here: https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-HL-23-006.html. The National Eye Institute (NEI) intends to commit an additional $1,000,000 to support up to three new awards in fiscal year 2024. To quote from the NEI's public notice of participation: “…The goal of NEI's participation in this [R38] funding opportunity is to encourage institutions to provide research training opportunities to clinician residents from Ophthalmology, Optometry, DVM, or other medical fields (with MD or equivalent degrees) who intend to pursue careers as clinician scientists committed to research related to the mission of NEI.” This is the kind of support that can change the direction of someone's career and increase the population of clinician scientists. It is important to note that optometric clinician scientist training programs are eligible to compete for this funding. For institutions interested in this program, the next application deadline is March 15, 2024. This funding opportunity will support institutional programs that propose to engage resident-investigators in research. The R38 mechanism provides salary support for investigators in training as well as other institutional support for their development. The program is structured to attract early career candidates with a goal to accelerate their development as clinician scientists. The program will provide mentored research designed for residents to work with experienced investigators for a minimum of 1 to 2 years. As stated in the program announcement: “… Research projects that include concepts of hypothesis-based, rigorous and reproducible research, the fulfillment of discovery, and achievement of designated research milestones Support for Resident-Investigators for 80% of Post Graduate Yearly salary for a minimum of one contiguous year of research and a maximum of two years during residency training Support for a minimum of two and a maximum of four Resident-Investigators each year Support for supplementary research and professional development activities that will contribute to successful research independence. “The overall goal of the Stimulating Access to Research in Residency (StARR) program is to provide clinicians with in-depth research experiences early in their careers, in order to recruit, retain and accelerate independence of a pool of clinician-investigators with both clinical and research experience necessary to perform basic, clinical and/or translational research. Applications are encouraged that propose well-designed institutional programs that will provide Resident-Investigators with research opportunities that can stimulate investigative curiosity and foster transition to additional research and career development, while also meeting requirements for [board…eligibility].” The challenge to attract, develop, and retain successful clinician scientists is not new, and the competition for trained clinician scientists in academia and in industry is increasing. Much has been written by others who recognize the challenge and the opportunity. From the NIH program announcement's language, they are aware and clearly working to address this challenge: “There is a critical workforce need for physician-scientists/clinician-investigators, i.e., those with clinical experience who conduct research and offer skills and perspectives directly related to human health, disease conditions, clinical decision-making, diagnoses, prevention, and improving health outcomes. Relatively few physicians and other health professionals are pursuing research careers, and existing opportunities may not maintain adequate numbers or diversity of physician scientists (Advisory Committee to the Director, Physician Scientist Workforce Report, 2014). The overall size of the current clinician-investigator workforce constitutes only a small proportion of all NIH-funded research investigators, and this is particularly true for early-stage clinician investigators. Thus new approaches are needed to recruit, prepare and retain more clinician-investigators from the large pool of potential researchers with health professional doctorates. Among today's NIH-funded clinician-investigators, about 60% hold a single health professional degree and 40% hold both health professional and research doctorate degrees. Women and individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups represent a particularly low proportion of this workforce.” Program success will ultimately depend on the number of clinician scientists who continue to engage in both patient care and translational research after training. This is often measured through successful applications for research program grants, for example, R01 and other award mechanisms, to previous trainees. This is a helpful new step toward strengthening the clinician scientist training pool. I applaud the leadership of the NEI Director, Michael Chiang, for his vision and dedication to advancing our shared interests. Even a small increase in the number of successful trainees could significantly enhance the future clinician scientist workforce. Michael D.

https://openalex.org/W4320718690,2023,Environmental science,"NIn his review of the initial Broadway run of The Emperor Jones in the Negro World for June 1921, Hubert H. Harrison described O’Neill’s play as a “joint product of the genius of Eugene O’Neill and Charles Gilpin.” Harrison perhaps gestured at the struggle between the white playwright and the Black actor over the creation of the titular character—the subject of Adrienne Earle Pender’s vibrant play N. The regional premier of N at DC’s compact Keegan Theatre was a compelling investigation of race, white privilege, and the obstacles that African Americans face in having their voices heard in a white-dominated theatrical world.The Emperor Jones was one of O’Neill’s first forays into expressionism. Accordingly, O’Neill decided that, rather than adhering to the accepted practice of casting a white actor in blackface, he would cast a Black actor as Brutus Jones. As the play’s director, George Cram Cook, asserted, “A blacked up white is not in the spirit of this production.”1 Gilpin was cast because, among other things, he had a remarkable vocal range and an expert ability realistically to express the intense emotions of a low-born Pullman porter rising to grandeur, then falling into a state of near primitivism. Early in N, Gilpin—played by the charismatic and passionate Kevin E. Thorne II—excitedly tells his no-nonsense wife, Florence—played by Lolita Marie, exuding wisdom, strength, and groundedness—that he landed the role because the similarities between his experiences and Brutus’s came through in the audition: “Brutus was an ex-Pullman porter, like me! He worked hard, had odd jobs all his life, like me! I knew him, baby!” O’Neill was so impressed that he hired Gilpin on the spot.Gilpin predicts that his portrayal of Brutus Jones in a high-profile play by a renowned white man will elevate the status of Black actors beyond what white theater-makers deemed “appropriate” for them. When the first reviews appear, it seems that Gilpin’s optimism is vindicated. Virtually all the respected critics are effusive in their praise of Gilpin’s stunning performance, even as many of them express reservations about the play itself (some Black critics found The Emperor Jones insulting—one stating that it “plays to the worst of Negro stereotypes”). With Gilpin as the main attraction, The Emperor Jones is a hit with audiences. While Gilpin is basking in the reviews and reckoning that his success signals progress for Black actors, Florence is not so sanguine. She tells Gilpin that, while she is proud of him, his role is an exception to the rule of Black subordination and that once the play closes, theater will go back to being as it had been, with more blackface and fewer jobs for Black actors. Gilpin is unfazed, mistakenly believing that he has the power to convince O’Neill to change some of the racist dialogue in The Emperor Jones, particularly the repetitions of the “n-word” that gives the play its title.The subsequent confrontation between Gilpin and O’Neill—played by Jared H. Graham with authority and a convincing mixture of dry wit and cynicism—is electric and provocative, especially when the two men argue over O’Neill’s insistence that Brutus Jones speak the n-word when referring to other Black men. Gilpin forcefully declares that he does not want to do so because, as written by a white man, the locution is racist and demeaning. O’Neill rejects Gilpin’s argument by peremptorily insisting that an actor’s job is to recite a playwright’s lines, without alterations. The conflict intensifies as Gilpin exclaims that he created Brutus Jones because he has lived the part every day and because, as a talented actor, he is able to transform the character into something greater than O’Neill authored or imagined. O’Neill, enraged, vehemently asserts that he as the playwright created Brutus as he visualized him, having agonized over all aspects of the character. O’Neill exclaims, “Every thought in his head, every blink of his eyes, every sub-conscious instinct, every conscious decision [exists] because I put it there!” Director Nadia Guevara did a magnificent job of displaying the characters’ conflicting sentiments by skillfully managing their tense movements and tortured visages.There is more than a hint of O’Neill’s sense of white superiority in this scene. After disdainfully blowing off Gilpin’s concerns, O’Neill offers up a microaggression disguised as a recuperative compliment when he casually opines that Gilpin would make a great Othello. Gilpin asserts that there would be no challenge in Othello, outside of “the novelty of a colored man playing a colored man.” Then, as Gilpin skillfully recites one of Othello’s speeches, O’Neill falls into stunned silence. O’Neill fumbles as he expresses surprise that a Black man could exhibit such a command of “white plays,” especially those of Shakespeare. Gilpin’s exasperation is palpable as he tries to explain that he’s had training in Shakespeare and that he’d be a superior actor in any part regardless of the race of the playwright. This compels O’Neill quickly to exit the scene. Thorne’s subtle but powerful look of displeasure illustrated Gilpin’s realization that the white man O’Neill holds all the cards here—meaning, perhaps, that his role as Brutus Jones will not result in any real change for him or his fellow Black actors.Scenic designer Matthew J. Keenan created a captivating and economical set appropriate to this small theater. Gilpin’s living room was stage right and O’Neill’s office was stage left. In the middle sat the jungle set of The Emperor Jones. This juxtaposition vividly highlighted the friction between O’Neill and Gilpin, as well as the larger rifts between the races. Lighting designer Venus Gulbranson adroitly set the mood by illuminating the jungle with a light green and beige backdrop that appeared as a clearing behind the lush tropical trees and thus created a convincing illusory depth. The rest of the stage, except where the spotlight shone on the actors, was dimly lit, capturing the dark ambiance of the play as well as simulating a shadowy jungle.The production drove home Gilpin’s spiritual demise at the hands of the white playwright by cleverly tying in some of the theatrics from the death scene in The Emperor Jones. Standing on the set-within-a-set, Gilpin and O’Neill again clash, two years after their last encounter. O’Neill chastises Gilpin for having cut the racist locutions in the touring production of The Emperor Jones. Gilpin defends his decision by saying that the n-word is not only racist but also reflects O’Neill’s view that Black people are “shiftless criminals and savages.” O’Neill confirms Gilpin’s conclusion, asserting that that was his intention. This infuriates Gilpin. The two men continue a heated argument that culminates in O’Neill’s firing of Gilpin and his announcing that he is replacing Gilpin with another Black actor, Paul Robeson. O’Neill adds the final insult by informing Gilpin that Robeson, not Gilpin, was his first choice to play Brutus Jones, but Robeson had initially turned the part down. At this point, the tom-toms begin playing at a furious tempo, as they do when Brutus Jones is on the run for his life and is subsequently killed by the natives whom he had fleeced. As he exits, O’Neill coldly informs Gilpin that he is “done.”Gilpin died a few years later in relative obscurity. Marie made the most of her role as Florence in the final scene, set at Gilpin’s funeral. With a devastating calmness and intense sincerity, Florence chastises O’Neill for firing Gilpin and making him beg for another chance to play Brutus Jones, which O’Neill had refused because Gilpin was “rude.” Florence continues her indignation by recounting how Gilpin’s star rose spectacularly in both white and Black societies during his tour de force portrayal of Brutus Jones, only for him to lose virtually everything when O’Neill humiliated him by firing him. O’Neill claims that he understands what Florence is saying, even complimenting Gilpin for being the only actor who “ever fully realized a part as I heard it in my head, as I wrote it and imagined it from the beginning.” Florence will have none of it. She coolly reminds O’Neill that Gilpin’s brilliance in The Emperor Jones helped secure O’Neill’s place in history, but that history has already forgotten Gilpin.N is a convincing portrait of the relationship between O’Neill and Gilpin. While the play does not claim to a wholly factual account, it is clear that Pender, a descendent of Gilpin, knows the history of the association well. O’Neill wasn’t shy about expressing his dislike of Gilpin after firing him. In a letter to the playwright Michael Gold, O’Neill said that Gilpin was often drunk, called his acting “all ‘ham,’” and claimed that “he [O’Neill] had stood for more from him than from all the white actors I’ve ever known—simply because he was colored.” Gilpin’s temerity in thinking that “no one could be got to play his part” rankled the playwright as well. Hence, O’Neill declared, he had “corralled another Negro” to star in future productions of The Emperor Jones.2 This is the O’Neill that N mistrusts, and rightly so.More important, N is a timely play that, by providing a vivid example of the tortured history of Black actors in American theater, illustrates the factionalism that still exists today. As with other contemporary plays like Jeremy O. Harris’s groundbreaking Slave Play, N reminds us that many whites still loudly deny but subtly affirm their racism. Pender gives her audience an opportunity to confront—and, one hopes, to expunge—the primal drive that normalizes discrimination.",en,1,0.0,0,{},0.0

https://openalex.org/W4376868665,2023,Environmental science,"ReconnectingHello, dear readers of the Journal of the Dermatology Nurses' Association (JDNA)! I am so excited to be writing to you for this issue. Recently, I had the fortunate opportunity to attend the annual Dermatology Nurses' Association (DNA) annual convention in Savannah, GA. What a great experience to reconnect with so many of my friends and colleagues and to meet new dermatology nurses for the first time. To be honest, participation in the DNA's annual convention is always a highlight of my year. I had not been to an in-person DNA meeting since the COVID-19 pandemic started, and it was everything I remembered. There is something to be said for spending extended time, even if just a few days, at a meeting of smart, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic dermatology nurses! I want you to know that you all inspire me with your passion and excitement for dermatology nursing. During the annual convention in Savannah, Nancy Smail, RN, became the newest DNA president. During her welcome speech at the annual business meeting, she shared, “As President, I believe I can further the goals of the DNA by promoting the need for ongoing education, supported by furthering expanded offerings in the CE Center for dermatology nursing professionals so that they can be confident of their skill levels to provide quality care as well as providing the necessary support in these challenging times.” She then invited attendees to “take some time to discover what committees you'd like to join, the educational offerings available, the authorship possibilities with the JDNA, and the opportunities to promote awareness of issues and concerns in the area of health policy and advocacy. Your involvement is not dependent on the number of degrees or letters after your name but rather what experience and ideas you bring to the table.” Speaking as a representative of the organization, she said, “Our mission is to provide knowledge and expertise as well as practical assistance to make that possible. To that end, my theme for this next year is to expand our vision to further our mission and so I have named the theme ‘Exploring the Scenery.’” I would like you all to take a look around the DNA and prepare yourselves to be challenged, excited, and inspired by what you see. Don't limit your ability to explore and find something that suits you best” (personal communication, February 27, 2023). Will you join us in “Exploring the Scenery” of the world of dermatology nursing? As usual, I sit in each lecture at the annual convention and try to take notes about important dermatology knowledge. I find the speakers always seem to add something to my knowledge, even if the lecture is on a topic I consider myself to be knowledgeable about! As per annual tradition, here are a few of the learning points I noted during the DNA's 2023 annual convention in Savannah: Nurses are agents of change. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) is the systemic version of bullous impetigo. If you see mucositis in the emergency room, be sure to check other mucous membranes as well. Reactive infectious mucocutaneous eruption may worsen after virus, for example, after COVID. Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms affects internal organs but does present with mucositis. Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms typically will be seen ~3–6 weeks after new medications. Comorbidities that can been seen with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) include cardiovascular concerns, inflammatory disease, polycystic ovarian syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, psychological issues, and arthritis. In HS, having the patient use zinc 100 mg with copper 5 mg daily may be helpful. In severe HS, consider stacking medication or using more than one medication at a time. For example, use a combination of rifampin, moxifloxacin, and metronidazole, or rifampin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole. Consider referring patients with HS to a specialty clinic if their symptoms persist. One may see squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in areas with long-standing HS; be on the lookout for this, and don't hesitate to biopsy these areas, especially if there are lesions in the groin or buttock areas. These SCCs can be very aggressive and have a high mortality rate. Pediatric patients absorb Janus kinase inhibitors quicker than adults. Alopecia areata (AA) is associated with comorbidities such as metabolic disease, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and anxiety. There have been reports of growth of hair in patients with AA after fecal transplant. Interleukin-17E has had a positive correlation with depression, which has implications for patients with AA, atopic dermatitis, and psoriasis. Inverse psoriasis may have a glazed, smooth appearance. Six to nine percent of patients with breast cancer will have skin involvement. Inflammatory breast carcinoma will present with sudden pain, redness and swelling of the breast, and/or induration/edema (peau d'orange) and, in general, has a poor prognosis. After radiation for breast cancer, chronic radiation dermatitis may occur. Radiation morphea will present with firm, red to violaceous plaques. Angiosarcoma may occur secondary to radiation exposure or to chronic lymphedema, usually about 10 years after radiation. Mucous membranes of the vagina and non-hair-bearing sites of the vulva are resistant to steroid-induced atrophy. Lichen sclerosis presents with hypopigmentation and is more common in women than men. It presents in prepubertal and perimenopausal ages. Lichen sclerosis will present with atrophy, white parchment skin appearance, and itch; have a figure-8 pattern and a red border; and have erosions and maybe labial fusion and clitoral hooding. These patients are at a high risk for SCC development. Lichen simplex chronicus results in accentuated skin markings and has a chronic itch–scratch cycle. Cutaneous lupus erythematosus is not a systemic condition. Again, remember, a patient can develop SCC in areas of chronic inflammation, including cutaneous lupus. The “butterfly rash” of lupus will spare the nasolabial fold. Livedo reticularis is a cutaneous pattern that looks like a fishnet and is worse when patients are cold. If the patterns stay on the skin, this is called livedo racemosa and is associated with collagen vascular diseases. In a patient with clotting concerns, consider antiphospholipid syndrome and look at labs such as the lupus anticoagulant, beta-2 glycoproteins, and cardiolipin antibodies. Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors can cause drug-induced lupus. Skin cancer is the most common malignancy after transplant. After a transplant, there is a 4:1 presentation of SCC to basal cell carcinoma. Forty-four percent of patients with a transplant will develop multiple skin cancers. Nicotinamide 500 mg BID (not niacin) may be a good vitamin for patients after a transplant; this may help prevent skin cancers, but always check with the patient's transplant team first. Posttransplant, ultraviolet exposure is the only risk factor a patient can control. Ask them to avoid sun exposure, use sun-protective clothing, wear sunscreen, and avoid being outside at times when the ultraviolet index is high. Slip, Slap, Slop, and Wrap: Slip on a shirt, slap on a hat, slop on sunscreen, and wrap eyes with glasses. For posttransplant patients, consider referral to academic centers for those with a high burden of disease. They need frequent visits, consistent care, education, and multidisciplinary care. Educate your patients that pet deaths can occur if they are using Efudex. Have the patient take measure to ensure this does not happen. The best sunscreen is the one you are going to use. For post-organ-transplant patients with skin of color, the skin of the genital areas is the most common spot for cancer. Transplant Recipients International Organization is a good patient support organization; consider encouraging patients to look into this group. One definition of an emerging disease is “a disease that is appearing for the first time in a particular population or that existed previously but is now rapidly increasing or presenting in a different population.” Emerging diseases do not need to be tropical or communicable, and examples now might include diabetes or foot ulcers. A patient needs tyrosine to make melanin. More than 100 skin conditions associated with COVID-19 or COVID-19 vaccinations have been documented, for example, COVID toes. When taking photographs of a patient's skin, consider getting a consent; this consent should have a clause that allows for the consent to be revoked at any time, and this is an important feature of a patient consent form. If you are like me, you find the days at a convention to be busy and filled to the brim with dynamic interactions with others who love nursing, and in this case dermatology nursing, as much as you do. I can't say enough to complement the DNA's program planning committee; I know how much work it must take to identify experts on specific dermatology topics and then invite them to be part of the DNA's annual event each year. All members of the program planning committee should be commended. I am sure they are already planning the DNA's 42nd annual convention in San Diego, CA, from March 6 to 9, 2024 (Figure 1). The theme for the event next year will be “Exceeding the Vision,” and I would ask you to consider how you might incorporate this theme in your own dermatology nursing practice over the next year.FIGURE 1.: DNA's 42nd annual convention in San Diego, CA.Please consider setting aside time in your schedule to allow for you to attend this amazing event. I think you will also find this annual event to not only be educational but also offer the chance to reconnect with colleagues and friends and have potential to make new dermatology nurse connections as well! If you have good ideas for future DNA convention topics or speakers, I am sure the program planning committee would love to have your input; be sure to share your ideas with the DNA! As always, looking forward to hearing from you. Angela L.

To develop a methodology for assessing forest suitability for certain varieties of unproductive soils. Methods. There are used the classical methods of soil science, agrochemistry, forest science, forest management, typology and mathematical statistics. Results. The principles of forest typology are the basis for determining the suitability of soils for forestation. Its essence lies in a comprehensive study of soil properties (soil morphometry, chemical composition) and forestry characteristics of forest stands, as well as an analysis of the grass-shrub layer by ecomorphs. The results of studies of the combined study of the productivity of forest stands and the properties of the main varieties of unproductive soils (sandy, eroded and skeletal) in different natural zones of the plain part of Ukraine are presented. Determination of the suitability of soils for forestation was assessed according to three categories: 1) unsuitable for forestation and conditionally suitable for forestation (very dry, very poor, toxic, with a limited rhizosphere zone, inaccessible or hardly accessible for cultivation); 2) limited suitability for forestation (dry and poor soils); 3) suitable for forestation. Packages of markers have been developed, on the basis of which it is possible to assess both their forest suitability and determine the type of forest growth conditions of non-forest lands. When compiling markers, preference was given to such soil indicators, which, along with informativeness in relation to soil quality, did not require complex methods of determination. The composition of markers includes morphological, physical, agrochemical parameters and depends on the type of soil. Conclusions. The developed packages of markers are the basis for the scientifically based creation of forests on unproductive lands, on which forest vegetation did not grow before. Their use in afforestation increases its efficiency and makes forests more resistant to adverse environmental factors. The Methodology is intended for forestry specialists, it can be used at enterprises, institutions of the forest sector, forest design organizations, as well as in related industries concerned with the protection and rational use of natural resources. The methodological developments can be included in the curricula of secondary and higher forestry-oriented education institutions.",en,1,189672.2406945396,9,"{'Environmental science': 7315, 'Biology': 14894, 'Chemistry': 7847, 'Geography': 4188, 'Sociology': 589, 'Philosophy': 512, 'Geology': 19, 'Psychology': 19, 'Political science': 19}",1.0

https://openalex.org/W4385293568,2023,Environmental science,"What is predictable? A commentary on Tetlock et al. (2023)Is prediction possible in world politics—and, if so, when? Tetlock et al. (2023) report some of the first systematic evidence on long-range political forecasting. Asked to guess which countries would get nuclear weapons within 25 years and which would undergo border changes due to war or secession, both experts and educated generalists outperformed chance. On nuclear proliferation—but not border changes—the experts beat the generalists, and the difference grew as the time scale increased from 5 to 25 years. What are we to make of this? The authors see messages for both “skeptics,” who consider the political future irreducibly opaque, and “meliorists,” who acknowledge the difficulties but think expertise can still improve predictions. Moreover, they suggest progress could be made through adversarial collaboration between scholars of the two persuasions, which would push both to specify their priors and adopt falsifiable positions. It's hard not to admire a research paper that has been more than 25 years in the making—and one can only rejoice that picky referees did not insist the experiment be rerun from scratch. The results prompt two broader questions. First, what makes something easier or harder to predict? Second, when does expertise help? At the risk of restating the obvious, let me offer a few thoughts. For clarity, consider a task like those in the article.1 Respondents at time t must guess the value of a variable Y i , t + N ∈ { Yes , No } ${Y}_{i,t+N}\in \{\mathrm{Yes},\mathrm{No}\}$ , N years in the future, for I countries indexed by i. The “success rate” is the proportion of countries for which the respondent chooses correctly. A task of this kind, A, is “easier” for a given individual than another task, B, if that individual's success rate on A tends to be higher than his success rate on B. When will that be the case? The authors give a few examples of easy and difficult tasks. That New Zealand and Norway will not fight a war is “trivially obvious” (p. 1). That anyone could guess who will be US president in 25 years is “far-fetched” (p. 2). They sought challenges for their respondents that fell within the “Goldilocks zone of difficulty” (p. 2), but they do not say what principles or heuristics guided this choice. Prediction involves the marriage of information to causal models, explicit or intuitive. This suggests a three-way division of determinants. Difficulty of prediction should depend on: (1) the nature of the underlying causal process, (2) the quality of available models, and (3) the supply of available information. Getting a high success rate will be easier when the causal process is regular. Most simply, that requires that Y i , t + N ${Y}_{i,t+N}$ have a well-defined mean or linear trend, to which it regresses over time (the process is stationary, in the sense that: Y i , t = α + γ Y i , t − 1 + β X i , t + ε i , t ${Y}_{i,t}=\alpha +\gamma {Y}_{i,t-1}+\beta {X}_{i,t}+{\varepsilon }_{i,t}$ where 0 ≤ γ < 1 ; E ( ε i , t ) = 0 ; V a r ( ε i , t ) = σ 2 $0\le \gamma \lt 1;E({\varepsilon }_{i,t})=0;Var({\varepsilon }_{i,t})={\sigma }^{2}$ and X i , t ${X}_{i,t}$ is a vector of exogenous variables that may include a time trend). Extrapolation from past to future is then possible. With variables that follow a random walk, the value of past information depreciates rapidly. Prediction is also easier if the respondent has a well-tested causal model (in the authors' phrase, “relevant and durable principles of causality… to guide forecasters” (p. 18)). The more tests the model has undergone, the more confidence one can generally have in estimated parameters. Finally, applying a valid model requires information about the values of causal variables, X i , t ${X}_{i,t}$ . These points also suggest when expertise will make a difference. Experts are those who have studied similar cases to develop causal models. When a causal process is highly irregular, study will not help, so regularity is a condition not just for predictability but also for expertise to matter. However, if processes are too simple, even laymen may decode them, so a certain degree of complexity should boost the expertise premium. Models will be more reliable when there has been plenty of opportunity to test them. So another condition is a rich history of similar cases. Finally, expertise should also increase familiarity with relevant information, so experts will have an advantage when information is accessible, but not too easily available to laypeople. These expectations about when expert analysis will improve prediction overlap with conditions under which subconscious intuition should be most trustworthy. “When do judgments reflect true expertise?” Kahneman (2011) asks. Answer: When the environment is regular, and when the experts have had opportunity “to learn these regularities through prolonged practice.” His example of reliable intuitive judgment is chess; by contrast, “stock picking and long-term political forecasting” are “zero-validity environments.”2 Psychology also suggests another type of expertise that may improve forecasting—familiarity with common biases and practice in “taming intuitive predictions.” Does time frame, N, affect predictability? That we know more about tomorrow than about the distant future is a cliché. Often that's right. Whether a woman will win the 2024 US presidential election is easier to guess than the gender of the 2044 winner. But short-run is not always easier. Whether Joe Biden will be president in 2025 is harder to predict than whether he will be in 2030. If change tends to occur in one direction, the odds of transition may cumulate, eventually reducing uncertainty about the outcome (“in the long run, we are all dead”). Measurable structural factors may over time outweigh unmeasurable contingencies. Estimating the impact of economic development on democratization is easier in 20-year than in 1-year periods (Treisman, 2015). In autocracies with income close to $5000, the best prediction of regime type in year t + 30—“autocracy”—would be right 57% of the time. The best prediction in year t + 60—“democracy”—would have an 81% success rate.3 What about complexity? While this tends to make things harder and increase the expert advantage, the outcomes of complex macro-systems are sometimes easier to predict than microchoices. The level of demand for cars in the US next year may be easier to forecast than which individuals will buy one. Sometimes emergent properties of complex systems are more regular than the individual actions that comprise them. Some think human actions are less predictable than physical phenomena because of subjectivity. This, too, is not always true. Some human behavior is highly structured, while some physical phenomena are extremely irregular. Among the games humans play, some have single equilibria, making outcomes easy to forecast. Others—often involving asymmetric information and beliefs about the beliefs of others—have multiple equilibria even for the same observable parameters. When many sets of mutually consistent beliefs are possible, it is hard to know which will be “selected.” Expertise might help—for instance, to identify relevant “focal points”—but often it will not. These considerations are summarized in Table 1. Might these ideas explain the difference in results for nuclear proliferation and border change? Although both causal processes are complex, that for nuclear proliferation involves fewer key players (state governments), and their identities are known, as opposed to secessionist groups that might emerge in future. In both cases, experts will be more familiar with key information than generalists. But whereas nuclear experts tend to know something about all potential nuclear powers, scholars who publish on secession often specialize in limited geographical areas. Few have expertise on both the Kuril Islands and the Ethiopia–Somalia border. Both questions may turn on beliefs about beliefs. But secession—like most processes involving mass mobilization—is particularly prone to multiple equilibria. Few want to join a movement that is too small to be effective, even if many would join one large enough to succeed. Models of such processes go by names like “tipping” or “prairie fires” that evoke the speed with which one equilibrium can replace another (Kuran, 1989; Schelling, 1978). All these factors suggest why border changes may be harder to predict than nuclear proliferation and less subject to expertise. On the other hand, there are far fewer past instances of the latter from which to learn. Nine states have acquired nuclear weapons, while at least 817 border changes occurred between 1816 and 1996 (Tir et al., 1998). Here, the greater number of cases seems to have been more than offset by the first three considerations. Although prediction in politics is bound to remain difficult, perhaps thinking along these lines may improve our predictions about what can and cannot be predicted.

While the integration of Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOP) techniques with SODIS for drinking water treatment has been advocated for such communities often lacking not only clean water but also reliable energy, the status of knowledge on empirical testing of these advancements remains fragmented and yet to be fully understood. In this intervention, we synthesize the literature to understand the progress made so far, the cumulative effect of AOP integration with SODIS and remaining questions for future empirical studies on AOP integrations with SODIS for sustainable clean water supply for all. Using the PRISMA methodology, we included and analyzed data from 16 empirical testing of AOP and SODIS integration between 1991 to 2022 reported in 37 studies retrieved from databases including PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. Results show AOP integration with SODIS significantly reduces time for complete disinfection of contaminants in relation to SODIS alone; non-recovery of inactivated organisms as well as the inactivation of SODIS resistance organisms for improved water production. The availability of suitable catalyst (reagents), sunlight availability and intensity as well as simple operational designs are some factors that inform the feasibility and operation of SODIS systems and their integration with AOP. It is recommended that future development agenda and research on water systems should focus on laboratory-scale experiments to pilot projects and improving inactivation efficiency for different AOP and their combined effects on water contaminants.",en,1,0.0,1,{'Geography': 3895},0.0

The territories adjacent to the gorge are a refugium of tertiary moisture-loving Colchis relic forest ecosystems, which have been awarded the status of a UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site. Ongoing work on the construction of a cascade hydroelectric power station in the gorge poses a risk of loss of the natural habitats. The article presents studies of assessing the ecological state of forest ecosystems in locations: Shuakhevi settlement, Shuakhevi water intake and Shuakhevi hydroelectric power station (HPP). In order to evaluate the current ecological state in the Ajaristskali gorge, the phytoextraction capacity of the dominant tree species forming the main natural forest in this area was studied. The alkalization of the soil samples taken from the Ajaristskali gorge was observed at the Shuakhevi HPP intake and Shuakhevi HPP. The soils are poor in total humus and nitrogen evidencing their decreased fertility. Data of the soil pollution hazard ratio show that the hazard of pollution with heavy metals, As, Ba, Cd, and Pb, exceeds 1-near Shuakhevi HPP intake and Shuakhevi HPP; pollution with Mo, Zn is observed at Shuakhevi HPP location; and Mn pollution is observed at all three locations. Based on the calculation of biological absorption coefficient of heavy metals, we have identified the dominant tree species forming the main natural forests on the study sites, whose vegetative parts have a good phyto-extraction ability for toxic elements. Such plants are: pine (needles), oak (leaves), and alder (leaves).",en,1,0.0,0,{},0.0

In this study, a spatial‐temporal analysis was used to estimate soil organic carbon (SOC) change in topsoil/A horizon and subsoil/B horizon at National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) sites, USA over 30 years. To separate the effects of land‐use, environmental, and edaphic factors on SOC change, space‐for‐time substitution was used in combination with the Continuous Change Detection and Classification algorithm and Structural Equation Modeling. Results showed that (a) under natural vegetation, Spodosols and Inceptisols found in the eastern NEON sites had substantial topsoil SOC accumulation (+0.4 to +1.2 Mg C ha −1 year −1 ), while Inceptisols and Andisols in the west had a comparable magnitude of topsoil SOC loss (−0.5 to −1.8 Mg C ha −1 year −1 ); (b) Mollisols and Alfisols in the Central Plains sites were susceptible to significant SOC loss under farming and grazing; (c) Runoff/erosion and leaching potential, vertical translocation, and mineral sorption were the most important factors controlling SOC variation across the NEON sites.

Prospective development and validation of AutoML models for DR image classification. A total of 17 829 deidentified retinal images from 3566 eyes with diabetes, acquired using handheld retinal cameras in a community-based DR screening program. AutoML models were generated based on previously acquired 5-field (macula-centered, disc-centered, superior, inferior, and temporal macula) handheld retinal images. Each individual image was labeled using the International DR and diabetic macular edema (DME) Classification Scale by 4 certified graders at a centralized reading center under oversight by a senior retina specialist. Images for model development were split 8-1-1 for training, optimization, and testing to detect referable DR ([refDR], defined as moderate nonproliferative DR or worse or any level of DME). Internal validation was performed using a published image set from the same patient population (N = 450 images from 225 eyes). External validation was performed using a publicly available retinal imaging data set from the Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society (N = 3662 images). Area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), accuracy, and F1 scores. Referable DR was present in 17.3%, 39.1%, and 48.0% of the training set, internal validation, and external validation sets, respectively. The model’s AUPRC was 0.995 with a precision and recall of 97% using a score threshold of 0.5. Internal validation showed that SN, SP, PPV, NPV, accuracy, and F1 scores were 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.884–0.99), 0.98 (95% CI, 0.937–0.995), 0.96 (95% CI, 0.884–0.99), 0.98 (95% CI, 0.937–0.995), 0.97, and 0.96, respectively. External validation showed that SN, SP, PPV, NPV, accuracy, and F1 scores were 0.94 (95% CI, 0.929–0.951), 0.97 (95% CI, 0.957–0.974), 0.96 (95% CI, 0.952–0.971), 0.95 (95% CI, 0.935–0.956), 0.97, and 0.96, respectively. This study demonstrates the accuracy and feasibility of code-free AutoML models for identifying refDR developed using handheld retinal imaging in a community-based screening program. Potentially, the use of AutoML may increase access to machine learning models that may be adapted for specific programs that are guided by the clinical need to rapidly address disparities in health care delivery.

In this study, we determined the role of Rho GTPase Activating Protein 30 (ARHGAP30) in OC progression. We measured ARHGAP30 abundance in OC tissue samples and cells using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and RT-qPCR. EdU, transwell, and annexin V/PI apoptosis assays were used to evaluate proliferation, invasiveness, and apoptosis of OC cells, respectively. The results showed that ARHGAP30 was overexpressed in OC tissue samples and cells. Inhibition of ARHGAP30 suppressed growth and metastasis of OC cells, and enhanced apoptosis. Knockdown of ARHGAP30 in OC cells significantly inhibited the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Treatment with the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibitor buparlisib simulated the effects of ARHGAP30 knockdown on growth, invasiveness, and apoptosis of OC cells.

To elucidate the effects of saline-alkali conditions on denitrification, incubation experiments with five salt and salt-alkali gradients and three nitrogen addition levels were conducted in a saline-alkali soil followed by determination of denitrification rates and the associated functional genes (i.e., nirK / nirS and nosZ Clade I) via N 2 /Ar technique in combination with q PCR. The results showed that denitrification rates were significantly decreased by 23.83–50.08%, 20.64–57.31% and 6.12–54.61% with salt gradient increasing from 1 to 3‰, 8‰, and 15‰ under 0.05‰, 0.10‰ and 0.15‰ urea addition conditions, respectively. Similarly, denitrification rates were significantly decreased by 44.57–63.24% with an increase of the salt-alkali gradient from 0.5 to 8‰. The abundance of nosZ decreased sharply in the saline condition, while a high salt level significantly decreased the abundance of nirK and nirS . In addition, the increase of nitrogen concentration attenuated the reduction of nirK , nirS and nosZ gene abundance. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) models demonstrated that salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO) in the overlying water, N concentration, and denitrifying gene abundance were key determinants of the denitrification rate in the saline environment, while pH was an additional determinant in the saline-alkali environment. Taken together, our results suggest that salinity and high pH levels decreased the denitrification rates by significantly inhibiting the abundance of the denitrifying genes nirK , nirS, and nosZ , whereas increasing nitrogen concentration could alleviate this effect. Our study provides helpful information on better understanding of reactive N removal and fertilizer application in the coastal areas.",en,2,0.0,0,{},0.0

ACFs has micropores, high surface area, and oxygen functional groups. The nucleophilic oxygen functional groups assist electrophilic CWAs adsorption by H-bonding and nucleophilic interaction. Due to many oxygen functional groups, ACF exhibit excellent CWAs adsorption performance. However, they are sensitive to moisture and difficult to selectively adsorb because of their characteristics, which limit their practical use and storage. Herein, we report a hydrophobic out-coating method that imparts hydrophobicity to only the ACF surface while maintaining the inherent structure and microporosity. The hydrophobic out-coated ACF (NML-F) is prepared by self-assembling hydrophobic agents on the ACF surface through a selective urethane reaction with the water affinity groups. NML-F is prepared by immersing ACF in a precursor solution. NML-F has a hydrophobic surface without blocking the microporous structure of ACF by controlling the reaction time. The hydrophobic surface of NML-F enables anti-moisture adsorption and selective adsorption.

Recent evidence suggests a rising incidence of both EOPC and LOPC. However, there are few data about their specific characteristics. The aim of our study is to determine the incidence of EOPC and LOPC and their correlation with epidemiological and clinicopathological features. Real world data were extracted and analyzed by the Gemelli GENERATOR within the Gemelli Science and Technology Park (G-STeP). Study population was identified from health records matching main inclusion criteria: hospitalized pts with a diagnosis of PC (International Classification of Disease 9, ICD-9 codes captured from structured data source) or pts with at least one anatomic pathology report including PC evidence (selected using clinically validated text mining techniques from unstructured data source). Two subgroups were defined: EOPC ( 75 years old) pts. Epidemiological and clinicopathological variables (gender; age, BMI, diabetes, history of pancreatitis, histology, primary tumor site, primary tumor surgery) were extracted using SAS (SAS(R) Institute suite for ETL). Statistical analyses were conducted using R (v4.2.1). From January 2018 to December 2020, a total of 1606 PC pts treated at our Institution were included in the analysis. The median age was 69 years, 51% were male and the median BMI was 25. Regarding comorbidities, only 4% and 3% of pts had diabetes and history of pancreatitis, respectively. Adenocarcinoma (1120/1126; 99%) was the most common histotype and pancreatic head (576/901, 64%) was the most frequent primary tumor site. Two hundred and ninety-three pts (18%) underwent primary tumor surgery. Concerning the two subgroups, 92 (6%) pts had EOPC and 510 (32%) had LOPC. The median age was 43 years in EOPC group and 81 years in LOPC group. No difference between the two groups was found in gender (p 0.83), BMI (p 1) and tumor histology (p 1). Diabetes was present in 1% and 7% of EOPC and LOPC pts (p 0.07) and pancreatitis history in 3% and 2% (p 0.79), respectively.

Evidence regarding its feasibility and safety is still sparse and does not include a subclassification for level III thrombi. We aim to compare the safety of laparoscopic vs open surgery in patients with levels I-IIIa thrombus. Materials and Methods: This is a cross-sectional comparative study using single-institutional data on adult patients treated surgically between June 2008 and June 2022. Participants were categorized into open and laparoscopic surgery groups. Primary outcome was difference in the incidence of 30-day major postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo III-V) between groups. Secondary outcomes were differences in operative time, length of hospital stay, intraoperative blood transfusions, delta hemoglobin level, 30-day minor complications (Clavien-Dindo I-II), estimated overall survival, and progression-free survival between groups. A logistic regression model was performed including adjustment for confounding variables. Results: Overall, 15 patients in the laparoscopic group and 25 patients in the open group were included. Major complications occurred in 24.0% of patients within the open group and 6.7% of patients were treated laparoscopically (p = 0.120). Minor complications arose in 32.0% of patients treated with open surgery and in 13.3% of patients treated in the laparoscopic group (p = 0.162). Although not significant, there was a higher perioperative death rate within open surgery cases. The laparoscopic approach presented a crude odds ratio for major complications of 0.22 (95% confidence interval 0.02-2.1, p = 0.191) compared with open surgery.

Drug resistance in cancer is one of the limiting factors contributing to unsuccessful therapies; therefore, understanding how cancer cells acquire this resistance is essential to help cure individuals affected by cancer. Recently, the altered microbiome was observed to be an important hallmark of cancer and therefore it represents a promising topic of cancer research. Our review aims to provide a global perspective of some cancer hallmarks, for instance how genetic and epigenetic modifications may be caused by an altered human microbiome.

Brazilein is a natural compound extracted from Caesalpinia sappan L., and has been demonstrated to be an anti-inflammatory anti- proliferative and apoptosis-inducer in various cancer cells. Here, we investigated the effect of brazilein on EMT and PD-L1 expression in breast cancer cells and its related molecular mechanisms using MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells as a model. Since the AKT, NF-κB, and GSK3β/β-catenin signaling were reported to be important mechanisms in immune escape and metastasis, the effect of brazilein on these signaling pathways were also found out in our study. Firstly, brazilein was treated on breast cancer cells at various concentrations to study cell viability, apoptosis, and apoptosis proteins. Then, breast cancer cells were treated with non-toxic concentrations of brazilein to study its influence on EMT and expression of PD-L1 protein using MTT, flow cytometry, western blot, and wound healing analysis, respectively. We found that brazilein exerts an anti-cancer effect by reducing cell viability via induction of apoptosis, while it also downregulated EMT and PD-L1 through suppression of phosphorylation of AKT, NF-κB, and GSK3β/β-catenin. Moreover, the migration ability was diminished by inhibiting the activation of MMP-9 and MMP-2.

Previously, we have demonstrated that H-Ras GTPase cycle activity is photoreversibly regulated by photochromic H-Ras, which is modified with 4-chloroacetoamido-4-sulfo-azobenzene (CASAB). However, the efficiency of photoregulation was not sufficient to utilize as a photo-switching.

However, as new biomarkers have been slow to be brought to clinical practice, we have developed a diagnostic algorithm that utilizes commonly used clinical measurements in those at risk of developing HCC. Briefly, as α-fetoprotein (AFP) is routinely used, an algorithm that incorporated AFP values along with four other clinical factors was developed. Discovery analysis was performed on electronic data from patients who had liver disease (cirrhosis) alone or HCC in the background of cirrhosis. The discovery set consisted of 360 patients from two independent locations. A logistic regression algorithm was developed that incorporated log-transformed AFP values with age, gender, alkaline phosphatase, and alanine aminotransferase levels. We define this as the Doylestown algorithm. In the discovery set, the Doylestown algorithm improved the overall performance of AFP by 10%. In subsequent external validation in over 2,700 patients from three independent sites, the Doylestown algorithm improved detection of HCC as compared with AFP alone by 4% to 20%. In addition, at a fixed specificity of 95%, the Doylestown algorithm improved the detection of HCC as compared with AFP alone by 2% to 20%. In conclusion, the Doylestown algorithm consolidates clinical laboratory values, with age and gender, which are each individually associated with HCC risk, into a single value that can be used for HCC risk assessment. As such, it should be applicable and useful to the medical community that manages those at risk for developing HCC. &lt;i&gt;Cancer Prev Res; 9(2); 172–9. ©2015 AACR&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",en,2,15491752.220541293,19,"{'Medicine': 20764, 'Psychology': 56164, 'Political science': 44365, 'Biology': 14215, 'Geography': 50260, 'Sociology': 78243, 'Philosophy': 54786, 'Engineering': 10699, 'Business': 23892, 'Art': 44437, 'Materials science': 5912, 'History': 84892, 'Environmental science': 72260, 'Computer science': 24405, 'Economics': 13052, 'Mathematics': 8184, 'Geology': 3414, 'Chemistry': 4727, 'Physics': 2445}",1.0

Methods: Our study is a cross-sectional analysis of population-representative surveys conducted between November 2019 and August 2020 among women aged 18–44 years in Arizona (N = 885), New Jersey (N = 952), and Wisconsin (N = 967). We use multivariable logistic regression to identify characteristics associated with each of five contraception source preference groups (in-person via health care provider, offsite with a provider via telemedicine, offsite without a provider via telehealth, at a pharmacy, or via innovative strategies), and we examine associations between contraceptive care experiences and perceptions and each preference group. Results: Across states, most respondents (73%) expressed preferences for obtaining contraception via more than one source. One quarter indicated a narrow preference for obtaining contraception in-person from a provider, 19% expressed interest in doing so offsite with a provider via telemedicine, 64% for doing so offsite without a provider via telehealth, 71% reported interest in pharmacy-based contraception, and 25% indicated interest in getting contraception through innovative strategies. Those who had experienced nonperson-centered contraceptive counseling reported higher levels of interest in telehealth and innovative sources, and those who expressed mistrust in the contraceptive care system had higher levels of preferring to obtain contraception offsite, via telemedicine, telehealth, and other innovative avenues. Conclusions: Policies that ensure access to a diversity of contraceptive sources, which acknowledge and address people's past experiences of contraceptive care, have the greatest likelihood of closing the gap between people's contraceptive access preferences and realities.",en,2,0.0,0,{},0.0

With more advanced care options including ever-evolving technology, allocation of resources becomes increasingly important to guarantee equal care for all. Therefore, we investigated healthcare resource utilization, hospital costs, and its determinants in Dutch children with diabetes.We conducted a retrospective, observational analysis with hospital claims data of 5,474 children with diabetes mellitus treated in 64 hospitals across the Netherlands between 2019-2020.Total hospital costs were €33,002,652 per year, and most of these costs were diabetes-associated (€28,151,381; 85.3%). Mean annual diabetes costs were €5,143 per child, and treatment-related costs determined 61.8%. Diabetes technology significantly increased yearly diabetes costs compared to no technology: insulin pumps € 4,759 (28.7% of children), Real-Time Continuous Glucose Monitoring € 7,259 (2.1% of children), and the combination of these treatment modalities € 9,579 (27.3% of children). Technology use increased treatment costs significantly (5.9 - 15.3 times), but lower all-cause hospitalisation rates were observed. In all age groups, diabetes technology use influenced healthcare consumption, yet in adolescence usage decreased and consumption patterns changed.These findings suggest that contemporary hospital costs of children with diabetes of all ages are driven primarily by the treatment of diabetes, with technology use as an important additive factor. The expected rise in technology use in the near future underlines the importance of insight into resource use and cost-effectiveness studies to evaluate if improved outcomes balance out these short-term costs of modern technology.",en,2,37361700.45786859,19,"{'Medicine': 38831, 'Biology': 18210, 'Philosophy': 130711, 'Political science': 111776, 'Engineering': 29727, 'Computer science': 56997, 'Mathematics': 39152, 'Art': 104724, 'Environmental science': 185821, 'Sociology': 183121, 'Economics': 57172, 'History': 237698, 'Psychology': 62521, 'Geology': 14106, 'Geography': 131690, 'Business': 87475, 'Materials science': 14291, 'Physics': 7055, 'Chemistry': 5801}",1.0

Conventional synthetic methods for producing bimetallic alloy nanoparticles often produce unalloyed and bulky particles that do not exhibit desired characteristics. Alloys, when prepared with advanced nanoscale methods, give higher surface area, activity, and selectivity than individual metals due to changes in their electronic properties and reduced size. This review demonstrates the synthesis methods and principles to produce and characterize highly dispersed, well-alloyed bimetallic nanoalloy particles in relatively simple, effective, and generalized approaches and the overall existence of conventional synthetic methods with modifications to prepare bimetallic alloy catalysts. The basic concepts and mechanistic understanding are represented with purposely selected examples. Herein, the enthralling properties with widespread applications of nanoalloy catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis are also presented, especially for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER), Oxidation Reduction Reaction (ORR), Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), and alcohol oxidation with a particular focus on Pt and Pd-based bimetallic nanoalloys and their numerous fields of applications.

Subregion analyses evaluated number of bleeding sites and plaque reduction.This meta-analysis included 21 gingivitis RCTs and 25 plaque RCTs. Relative to manual and sonic brushes, oscillating-rotating brushes had a higher percentage of participants who transitioned to gingival health (72% vs 21% and 54%; P < .001). Compared with manual and sonic brushes, respectively, oscillating-rotating brushes demonstrated greater bleeding site reductions (by 52% and 29%; P < .001) and superior plaque reductions (by 19% and 5%; P < .001). Oscillating-rotating brushes provided faster transitions to health than sonic brushes and showed greater efficacy across subregions. The most advanced oscillating-rotating brush demonstrated statistically significantly greater efficacy compared with traditional oscillating-rotating, manual, and sonic brushes when analysed separately.

In this case, adjuvant therapy can be used to reduce the risk of recurrence. One of the types of maintenance cancer therapy is cell-based immunotherapy, in which immune cells, such as T-cells, NKT-cells, B cells, NK cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells are used to recognize and mobilize the immune system to kill cancer cells.

In the TODAY study of youth with T2D, we measured sRAGE 3 times at: randomization (T1), glycemic failure (HbA1c≥8%) on randomized treatment or midpoint in study (T2), and end of follow-up (T3). Of TODAY subjects, 165 lost glycemic control with HbA1c ≥ 8% (G1) and 135 maintained HbA1c &amp;lt; 8% (G2)]. Controls [n=99, HbA1 5% (4.9, 5.2), with similar obesity, sex (60% female), race-ethnicity, median age 24 (21, 27) years as the TODAY cohort at T3] had sRAGE measured once. Multivariable models examined the relationship of sRAGE with nephropathy [urine albumin: creatinine (UACR) ≥30 mg/g, hyperfiltration (eGFR ≥135 ml/min/1.73m2)] and vascular measures [pulse wave velocity (PWV), augmentation index (AI)], adjusting for treatment, diabetes duration, HbA1c, BMI, age, sex, and race-ethnicity. At T1, the T2D youth groups had similar age (13.9 yrs), diabetes duration (0.7 yrs), and sex (60% female). sRAGE concentrations were lower in T2D vs. controls (752.8±308.3 vs. 954.4 ± 356.7 pg/ml, p&amp;lt;0.0001) at T3. By T3 (mean duration 7 yrs), sRAGE levels decreased compared with T1 and T2 in G1 vs. G2 (p&amp;lt;0.05). sRAGE concentrations were 711.9±294.1 vs. 802.7±318.9 pg/ml, p=0.0032 in G1 vs. G2 at T3, with no significant difference by treatment. HbA1c was inversely related with sRAGE. Higher sRAGE concentrations were associated with a lower risk of hyperfiltration (HR=0.93, 95% CI 0.86-0.99, p=0.03) and inversely related to eGFR (p&amp;lt;0.001); no relationships were observed with UACR, PWV, or AI. sRAGE levels decline overtime in youth with T2D, are inversely related to glycemia, and may serve as a biomarker of kidney function.

(1996) experiment is revisited to suggest an alternative model of a single photon. Photon-counting experiments using spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) show that not every single-photon incident on a detector triggers it, and that coincident triggering of detectors can occur during a single gate. The latter is usually interpreted as being caused by spurious photons entering the gate from different SPDC events. However, a pseudo-classical-type model is suggested which dispenses with these intruder photons. Here, a single-photon manifests as a transversely-iterated front of non-rotating screw threads. Each advancing thread has the potential to trigger a detector, and each allows the transfer of spin angular momentum (SAM).

Aiton) is cultivated as a commercial floricultural crop in many countries around the world (Gao et al. 2020). From June to August 2020, leaf spots on jasmine were observed on a jasmine plantation in Hengzhou, Guangxi province. Over 40% of the plants in 6 ha fields were infected. This disease was prevalent in jasmine production areas of China (Chen et al. 2012; Du et al. 2020). Symptoms began as chlorotic regions (from 5 to 10 mm in diameter) with light brown necrotic centers, which gradually expanded to the entire leaf. Eventually, the disease led to defoliation and dieback. The edges of affected parts from diseased leaves were cut into pieces (3 mm2). Pieces were treated with 75% ethanol for 10 s, soaked in 2% NaClO solution for 1 min, washed three times with sterile water, and incubated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates at 28°C for 5 days in the dark. Fungal cultures that showed similar morphological characteristics were isolated, and three representative isolates (HL6-1 to HL6-3) were purified following Mo et al. (2018). The cultures on PDA changed from white to dark gray after 7 days and produced conidiomata after 14 days. Conidia were hyaline, one celled, guttulate, cylindrical, and 12.07 to 18.09 × 4.04 to 8.05 μm, 13.17 to 16.35 × 4.22 to 6.13 μm, and 10.11 to 22.17 × 3.65 to 8.1 μm for HL6-1, HL6-2, and HL6-3, respectively. Gray-brown or dark brown appressoria formed from conidia were subglobose or elliptical. Conidial appressoria and mycelial appressoria were 5.53 to 13.96 × 3.58 to 13.95 μm and 4.24 to 14.01 × 2.4 to 10.86 μm. Genomic DNA was extracted from three isolates and the partial internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions, intergenic region of apn2 and MAT1-2-1 (ApMAT), and fragments of actin (ACT), glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), chitin synthase (CHS-1), and β-tubulin (TUB2) genes were amplified, sequenced, and submitted to GenBank (ITS, ON115173 to ON115175; ApMat, ON156517 to ON156519; ACT, ON146469 to ON146471; GAPDH, ON156502 to ON156504; CHS-1, ON156507 to ON156509; TUB-2, ON156512 to ON156514). A phylogenetic tree was constructed with MrBayes v. 3.2.6 and MEGA v. 10.1.5 based on the concatenation of multiple sequences. The three isolates were grouped with strain Colletotrichum siamense ICMP 18578. Results indicated the three isolates were identified as C. siamense Prihastuti, L. Cai & K.D. Hyde. To confirm the pathogenicity of the three isolates, four sets (five plants per set) of 160 healthy leaves of 2-year-old plants (J. sambac, eight leaves per plant) were slightly scratched with a sterilized toothpick at each of eight locations. Conidial suspensions (1 × 106 conidia/ml) in 0.1% Tween 20 were inoculated onto each wounded spot of three sets as the treatment groups, and wounded leaves treated with sterile water were the control. All plants were covered with plastic bags and cultivated in a phytotron (12 h/12 h light/dark, 28°C). After 7 days, irregular chlorotic regions with brown lesions were observed on inoculated leaves while no symptoms appeared on controls. The same fungi were reisolated from inoculated leaves and confirmed by morphological and molecular identification, fulfilling Koch’s postulates. C. siamense has been associated with leaf anthracnose of J. sambac in Vietnam (Wikee et al. 2011) and Jasminum mesnyi in China (Zhang et al. 2019). To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. siamense causing jasmine anthracnose in China, which provides a reference for the management of this disease.The author(s) declare no conflict of interest.References:Chen, Y.

Most of these monuments preserve wooden elements: whether structural, decorative or furnishings. Many preserve wall paintings that are considered among the best examples of Byzantine and Medieval art in the Eastern Mediterranean. The dating of these paintings as well as the church buildings themselves, has been based mainly on style, with occasional dedicatory inscriptions and related historical interpretation.

Disturbed BMPR2/TGFβ signaling is a driver of disease progression. Inhibition of Histone deacetylases (HDACs) using small molecule inhibitors attenuated vascular remodeling, however, they worsened RV function in animal models of PAH. <b>Objectives:</b>&nbsp;The aim of this study is to validate if the selective HDAC inhibitor Quisinostat reverses pulmonary vascular remodeling and improves RV function. <b>Methods and results:</b>&nbsp;We found that protein levels of HDAC1 are increased in the lungs of PAH patients. Treating microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs) and smooth muscle cells of PAH patients with Quisinostat significantly decreased TGF-β signaling and strongly decreased cell proliferation and the levels of inflammatory cytokines. In the MCT-shunt and Sugen Hypoxia rat models of severe angioproliferative PAH, Quisinostat reversed abnormal vascular remodeling and improved RV function. Furthermore, Quisinostat&nbsp;could be combined safely with the contemporary PAH standard of care. Finally, Quisinostat improved the RV function in rats with RV pressure load induced by pulmonary artery banding, and no systemic or cardiotoxic effects were observed. <b>Conclusions:</b>&nbsp;Our data demonstrate that selective inhibition of HDACs reverses pulmonary vascular remodeling and improves RV function. These data support the establishment of a clinical trial with Quisinostat in patients with PAH.",en,2,0.0,0,{},0.0

In the last two decades, significant advances have been made in management of World Health Organization (WHO) group 1 PH. However, there are no approved targeted pharmacotherapies for PH secondary to left-sided heart diseases or chronic hypoxic lung diseases which are thought to account for more than 70-80% of the disease burden. No recent investigation has analyzed and compared the mortality burden related to WHO group 1 PH with the mortality burden with WHO groups 2-5 PH at the national level in the United States (US). We hypothesize that WHO group 1 PH-related mortality has improved over the last two decades in comparison to WHO groups 2-5 PH.In this study, we used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (CDC WONDER) the underlying cause of death database to study age-standardized mortality rates related to PH in the US from 2003 to 2020.A total of 126,526 deaths were recorded from PH in the US between 2003 and 2020.

We estimated the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the preceding 14-day period. Respondents were asked about SARS-CoV-2 testing, testing outcomes, COVID-like symptoms, and contact with SARS-CoV-2 cases. SARS-CoV-2 prevalence estimates were age- and sex-adjusted to the 2020 U.S.We triangulated survey-based prevalence estimates with contemporaneous official SARS-CoV-2 counts of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, as well as SARS-CoV-2 wastewater concentrations.We show that 22.1% (95% CI 17.9-26.2%) of respondents had SARS-CoV-2 infection during the two-week study period, corresponding to ~1.5 million adults (95% CI 1.3-1.8 million). The official SARS-CoV-2 case count during the study period is 51,218. Prevalence is estimated at 36.6% (95% CI 28.3-45.8%) among individuals with co-morbidities, 13.7% (95% CI 10.4-17.9%) among those 65+ years, and 15.3% (95% CI 9.6-23.5%) among unvaccinated persons. Among individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 infection, hybrid immunity (history of both vaccination and infection) is 66.2% (95% CI 55.7-76.7%), 44.1% (95% CI 33.0-55.1%) were aware of the antiviral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, and 15.1% (95% CI 7.1-23.1%) reported receiving it. Hospitalizations, deaths and SARS-CoV-2 virus concentrations in wastewater remained well below that during the BA.1 surge.Our findings suggest that the true magnitude of NYC's BA.2/BA.2.12.1 surge may have been vastly underestimated by routine case counts and wastewater surveillance. Hybrid immunity, bolstered by the recent BA.1 surge, likely limited the severity of the BA.2/BA.2.12.1 surge.It is difficult to assess the true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, due to changes in testing practices and behaviors, including increasing at-home testing and decreasing healthcare provider-based testing. We conducted a population-representative survey in New York City to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 during the second Omicron surge in spring 2022. We compared survey-based SARS-CoV-2 prevalence estimates with data on diagnosed cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and SARS-CoV-2 concentration in wastewater. Our survey-based estimates were nearly 30 times higher than official case counts and estimates of immunity among those with active infection were high. Taken together, our results suggest that the magnitude of the second Omicron surge was likely significantly underestimated, and high levels of immunity likely prevented a major surge in hospitalizations/deaths.

Despite the area's importance, not much is known regarding the spatio-temporal variation of human diets and the associated subsistence practices during the Bronze Age. This dearth of information is largely due to the absence of key evidence from the EASR during 3000–2200 years before present (yr B.P.). In this study, we report new carbon and nitrogen isotopic data, including radiocarbon dates of human and animal bones unearthed from the Shijia-Yucun (SJ-YC) site in the EASR, dated between ∼2700 and 2500 yr B.P. During our target period of study, the humans, pigs and dogs living in SJ-YC mainly consumed C4 foods (millets and millet by-products), while herbivorous livestock consumed a mix of C3 and C4 plants. Combined with published isotopic and archaeobotanical data, we detected an asynchronous transformation of dietary patterns in different regions of the EASR during the Bronze Age. Between 3500 and 2200 yr B.P., staple foods for most western EASR humans shifted from C4 to mixed C3 and C4 foods. In the eastern EASR, C4 foods remained dominant in human diets throughout the Bronze Age. Patterns in dietary changes are not completely consistent with the various trajectory of crop cultivation. We propose that, in the context of Bronze Age trans-Eurasian exchanges, humans adopted different livelihoods throughout the EASR to deal with the survival pressures and social customs associated with variations in climate, population, and geopolitical factors.

In general, the stoma is closed 3 months after the initial operation. The diverting stoma reduces the rate of anastomotic leakage as well as the severeness of a potential leakage itself. Nevertheless, anastomotic leakage is still a life-threatening complication and might reduce the quality of life in the short and long term. In case of leakage, the construction can be converted into a Hartmann situation or it could be treated by endoscopic vacuum therapy or by leaving the drains. In recent years, endoscopic vacuum therapy has become the treatment of choice in many institutions. In this study, the hypothesis is to be evaluated, if a prophylactic endoscopic vacuum therapy reduces the rate of anastomotic leakage after rectal resections. Methods A multicenter parallel group randomized controlled trial is planned in as many as possible centers in Europe. The study aims to recruit 362 analyzable patients with a resection of the rectum combined with a diverting ileostoma. The anastomosis has to be between 2 and 8 cm off the anal verge. Half of these patients receive a sponge for 5 days, and the control group is treated as usual in the participating hospitals. There will be a check for anastomotic leakage after 30 days. Primary end point is the rate of anastomotic leakages. The study will have 60% power to detect a difference of 10%, at a one-sided alpha significance level of 5%, assuming an anastomosis leakage rate of 10%–15%.

DNA methylation variations were introduced into the parasite vector snail Biomphalaria glabrata with low genetic diversity by chemical treatment in F0 and followed over 3 generations using epigenetic recombinant inbred lines (epiRILs). We observed phenotypic variation in complex traits such as fecundity and susceptibility to infestation by Schistosoma mansoni and DNA methylation differences in F3. Both, increase and decrease of infestation success (up to 100% and down to 20% prevalence in epiRILs and from 86% to 94% in control RILs) indicated variation in complex resistance/compatibility trait. Average prevalence in control RILs was 84±5% but only 68±21 % in epiRILs. Fecundity also changed and was in average 47±7% in control RILs and 59±18% in epiRILs, being 12% higher in epiRILs.

However, there are very few research works in the open literature studying the mixture flow boiling in plate heat exchangers, and none of the existing works address high temperature boiling, which is the prevailing working condition in the evaporator of organic Rankine cycle systems. This paper presents an experimental study of high temperature flow boiling of zeotropic mixtures of R134a/R245fa in a plate heat exchanger. Five compositions were tested at the reduced pressures 0.45, 0.55 and 0.65 and various heat fluxes and mass fluxes. In addition, the predictive performance of several existing prediction methods for the heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop were evaluated, and based on the results, new heat transfer and pressure drop prediction methods were developed. The experimental results suggest that the heat transfer is dominated by the nucleate boiling. The mixture having a 0.427/0.573 mass composition presents the largest heat transfer degradation, up to 42 %, compared with the pure fluids. As far as the pressure drop is concerned, the results suggest that the zeotropic mixtures have the same pressure drop characteristics as the pure fluids, and the five mixtures have almost the same frictional pressure drop due to their similar thermo-physical properties. Existing methods provide a good prediction of the heat transfer data. The new heat transfer correlations enable an even better predictive performance than those available in the literature, however, it remains to evaluate the predictive performance of the new correlation for other working fluids, plate heat exchanger geometries and working conditions than those considered in the paper.",en,2,145037.18753100216,13,"{'Materials science': 24507, 'Physics': 5354, 'Chemistry': 2296, 'Engineering': 2158, 'Geology': 152, 'History': 114, 'Geography': 54, 'Sociology': 356, 'Mathematics': 38, 'Art': 76, 'Environmental science': 114, 'Political science': 74, 'Psychology': 36}",1.0

Here, we demonstrate that the receptor tyrosine kinases, Ltk and Alk, are required for proper neuronal polarization. In isolated primary mouse embryonic neurons, loss of Ltk and/or Alk yields a striking multiple axon phenotype. In mouse embryos and newborn pups, the absence of Ltk and Alk results in a delay in neuronal migration and subsequent cortical patterning. In adult cortices, neurons with aberrant neuronal projections are evident and there is a disruption of the axon tracts in the corpus callosum. Mechanistically, we show that loss of Alk and Ltk increases cell surface expression and activity of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (Igf-1r), which acts to activate downstream PI3 kinase signalling to drive the excess axon phenotype.

The most efficient solution uses the memory bank extracted from the nominal samples to detect outliers. We approach our strategy, the multi-category decomposition editing network (MCDEN), from a similar viewpoint. Notably, we do not use defect-free samples. Instead, we use virtual results to construct a defect library. MCDEN decomposes abnormalities to basic elements from the library while editing outlier features to reconstruct the texture normality, offering a rational segmentation map through decomposition and reconstruction. Based on this strategy, MCDEN is more interpretable than most neural network methods since interpretability is particularly important in industrial production to ensure stability; however, the existing deep learning methods are similar to a black box structure, which makes MCDEN more appropriate in industry. Experiments on texture surface samples from the MVTec anomaly detection (MVTAD) dataset confirm the efficacy of MCDEN with a pixel-level area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) score of 96.6%.

The inherent difficulties co-existing in network traffic datasets, such as class imbalance, class overlapping, and noises, limit detection accuracy. However, existing research has only focused on the disproportion between classes. Considering these difficulties, a novel ensemble method is proposed for network intrusion detection called DUEN. Dynamic undersampling is incorporated into the Boosting framework to provide a relatively balanced training subset for each iteration to achieve a strong ensemble. In dynamic undersampling, the sampling number is determined based on data distribution learning to cope with the small sample overfitting problem caused by simple undersampling. The concept of classification hardness for integrating data difficulties is employed to identify samples as easy, borderline, and noisy types. Boundary samples importance enhancement mechanism is proposed for the undersampling process, preventing overfitting noise samples. The proposed sampling method does not involve distance calculation, achieving very low computational costs. Experiments show the effectiveness of DUEN with multiclass classification on two widely used datasets for evaluating intrusion detection. DUEN has high detection accuracy for both minority and majority class samples and a significant time efficiency advantage. The Macro.F1 of NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasets reached 70.7% and 50.1%, achieving 6.32% and 1.42% improvement compared with the suboptimal network intrusion detection methods.

Considering the existing vaccine inefficiency rate of 0.1, the model estimates there are 449,535 (95%CI [415,651, 483,420]) potentially infectious hepatitis B virus infections, constituting 30.49% of total hepatitis B cases. Date fitting using MATLAB reveals that increasing the rate of hepatitis B vaccinations can effectively reduce the number of infections.the results reveal that the number of potential infectious hepatitis B virus infections is so high that the number of hepatitis B patients persistently rises in China. To better control the transmission of the hepatitis B virus, an optional prevention and control strategy is needed to increase the vaccination of different age groups, and it is necessary to help the public correctly understand the transmission of hepatitis B and ensure adequate protection.",en,2,0.0,0,{},0.0

However, the trajectory and inter-relationship between these factors are unknown.Part&Sed is a research project based on an observational study design with 6 and 12 months of follow-ups in stroke survivors. In addition, a qualitative analysis of the impact of the stroke on the stroke survivor, validation of the Satisfaction with Daily Occupation-Occupational Balance assessment tool and analysis of the reliability of the Fitbit Inspire 2 activity tracker wristband will be carried out. Participants will be chronic stroke survivors with independent walking capacity. Sociodemographic and clinical data, physical activity, ambulation, sleep, quality of life, anxiety and depression, community participation, and occupational satisfaction and balance, as well as data provided by the activity tracker wristband, will be collected. In addition, if the participant has a primary caregiver, the caregiver will also be monitored. A minimum of 130 participants will be recruited to conduct a random-effects multiple regression model. Mixed models for repeated measures will assess the variation over time of the different variables associated with participation and sedentary behaviour. Psychometric properties (eg, internal consistency, construct validity, test-retest reliability) of the Satisfaction with Daily Occupation-Occupational Balance will be determined. Additionally, intraclass correlation coefficients and minimum detectable change will be calculated to assess intrasubject reliability of physical activity and sleep parameters recorded by the Fitbit Inspire 2.

Firstly, a geometric lattice is associated to any discrete L -algebra. Monoids of I-type are obtained as a special case where the perspectivity relation is trivial. Secondly, the structure group of a non-degenerate discrete L -algebra X is determined and shown to be a complete invariant. It is proved that X ∖ {1} is a projective space with an orthogonality relation. A new definition of non-symmetric quantum sets, extending the recursive definition of symmetric quantum sets, is provided and shown to be equivalent to the former one. Quantum sets are characterized as complete projective spaces with an anisotropic duality, and they are also characterized in terms of their complete lattice of closed subspaces, which is one-sided orthomodular and semimodular.

Since traditional ways of taking attendance are not that useful as it is highly time-consuming to mark the attendance of every student by calling their names as well as the use of papers to mark the attendance also affects our environment, therefore our system helps to save time as well as its eco-friendly as no paper is needed, helps to solve problems of fake attendance and proxies. The Haar Cascade & LBPH algorithms are used in this work to develop a Student’s Attendance System with facial recognition technology. Face detection and recognition are two steps in realtime human face recognition. As of Haar Cascades algorithm’s excellent precision and high real-time permit rate, which is implemented in OpenCV via the Python language, we use it for face detection. The training phase and evaluation phase are two categories taken into consideration in face recognition. The algorithm is trained during the training phase using samples of the image to be learned and the test image is compared across all trained samples in the dataset during the estimate step. By using Local Binary Patterns Histogram(LBPH), the live stream’s faces are recognized & the face characteristics are taken out. Face recognition is completed using the Euclidean distance classifier using the LBPH. The control of the system in computer-based communication is significantly impacted by authentication.

The low aluminium mole concentration decreases the surface defects which reduces the leakage current, thereby increasing the breakdown voltage of the device. To validate the simulation results, calibration of the device models has been performed with experimental results. Results present that the proposed device exhibits high breakdown voltage, high transconductance and low small signal capacitances. The proposed device achieves improvement in breakdown voltage, transconductance and small signal capacitances as compared to the conventional hybrid buffer high electron mobility transistor (HB-HEMT).

https://openalex.org/W4381849203,2023,"['Medicine', ' Political science']","Laser-assisted cataract surgery versus standard ultrasound phacoemulsification cataract surgeryBackground Cataract is the leading cause of blindness in the world and, as such, cataract surgery is one of the most commonly performed operations globally. Surgical techniques have changed dramatically over the past half century with associated improvements in outcomes and safety. Femtosecond lasers can be used to perform the key steps in cataract surgery, such as corneal incisions, lens capsulotomy and fragmentation. The potential advantage of femtosecond laser‐assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) is greater precision and reproducibility of these steps compared to manual techniques. The disadvantages are the costs associated with FLACS technology. Objectives To compare the effectiveness and safety of FLACS with standard ultrasound phacoemulsification cataract surgery (PCS) by gathering evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2022, Issue 5); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; LILACS; the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov; the WHO ICTRP and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website. We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 10 May 2022. Selection criteria We included RCTs where FLACS was compared to PCS. Data collection and analysis Three review authors independently screened the search results, assessed risk of bias and extracted data using the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcome for this review was intraoperative complications in the operated eye, namely anterior capsule, and posterior capsule tears. The secondary outcomes included corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), quality of vision (as measured by any validated patient‐reported outcome measure (PROM)), postoperative cystoid macular oedema complications, endothelial cell loss and cost‐effectiveness. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Main results We included 42 RCTs conducted in Europe, North America, South America and Asia, which enrolled a total of 7298 eyes of 5831 adult participants. Overall, the studies were at unclear or high risk of bias. In 16 studies the authors reported financial links with the manufacturer of the laser platform evaluated in their studies. Thirteen of the studies were within‐person (paired‐eye) studies with one eye allocated to one procedure and the other eye allocated to the other procedure. These studies were reported ignoring the paired nature of the data. There was low‐certainty evidence of little or no difference in the odds of developing anterior capsular tears when comparing FLACS and PCS (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 1.72; 5835 eyes, 27 studies) There was one fewer anterior capsule tear per 1000 operations in the FLACS group compared with the PCS group (95% CI 4 fewer to 3 more). There was low‐certainty evidence of lower odds of developing posterior capsular tears with FLACS compared to PCS (Peto OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.00; 5767 eyes, 26 studies). There were four fewer posterior capsule tears per 1000 operations in the FLACS group compared with the PCS group (95% CI 6 fewer to same). There was moderate‐certainty evidence of a very small advantage for the FLACS arm with regard to CDVA at six months or more follow‐up, (mean difference (MD) ‐0.01 logMAR, 95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.00; 1323 eyes, 7 studies). This difference is equivalent to 1 logMAR letter between groups and is not thought to be clinically important. From the three studies (1205 participants) reporting a variety of PROMs (Cat‐PROMS, EQ‐5D, EQ‐SD‐3L, Catquest9‐SF and patient survey) up to three months following surgery, there was moderate‐certainty evidence of little or no difference in the various parameters between the two treatment arms. There was low‐certainty evidence of little or no difference in the odds of developing cystoid macular oedema when comparing FLACS and PCS (Peto OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.28; 4441 eyes, 18 studies). There were three fewer cystoid macular oedema cases per 1000 operations in the FLACS group compared with the PCS group (95% CI 10 fewer to 6 more). In one study the incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio (ICER) (cost difference divided by quality‐adjusted life year (QALY) difference) was GBP £167,620 when comparing FLACS to PCS. In another study, the ICER was EUR €10,703 saved per additional patient who had treatment success with PCS compared to FLACS. Duration ranged from three minutes in favour of FLACS to eight minutes in favour of PCS (I2 = 100%, 11 studies) (low‐certainty evidence). There was low‐certainty evidence of little or no important difference in endothelial cell loss when comparing FLACS with PCS (MD 12 cells per mm2 in favour of FLACS, 95% CI ‐40 to 64; 1512 eyes, 10 studies). Authors' conclusions This review of 42 studies provides evidence that there is probably little or no difference between FLACS and PCS in terms of intraoperative and postoperative complications, postoperative visual acuity and quality of life. Evidence from two studies suggests that FLACS may be the less cost‐effective option. Many of the included studies only investigated very specific outcome measures such as effective phacoemulsification time, endothelial cell count change or aqueous flare, rather than those directly related to patient outcomes. Standardised reporting of complications and visual and refractive outcomes for cataract surgery would facilitate future synthesis, and guidance on this has been recently published.",en,2,0.0,0,{},0.0

This article analyses the impact of the company's performance after the IPO, starting with operating capacity, profitability and growth capacity, and comparing the data before and after the IPO. The comparison reveals that the overall operating capacity is slightly lower than before the IPO, and the company's profitability also shows a decline and a significant decline in growth capacity, indicating a reduction in the scale of the company's development. Regarding the correlation between regulatory enquiries and share price performance, the number of enquiries made to all GEM-listed companies under the registration system and the price suppression rate is statistically significant.

The researcher aims to examine the dynamic paraphernalia of fiscal policy shocks on real GDP growth and interest rates, as well as to provide insights into the transmission mechanisms and policy implications. The analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset comprising key fiscal policy indicators, tax revenue, government expenditure, real interest rates, and real GDP growth for Kenya from 1998 to 2023. The VAR model is estimated, and robustness of results was assessed through various tests. The findings reveal that increases in government expenditure and tax revenue positively impact economic growth, while fiscal policy variables also influence interest rate dynamics. These results have important implications for policymakers in designing effective fiscal and monetary policies to stimulate economic growth and maintain financial stability.

The proposed circuit possess 11 switches, 2 diodes, and 3 capacitors. A simple level‐shifted modulation method has been used to generate the switching signals. The key feature of the proposed circuit is the presence of common ground between the input and output. The CG configuration eliminates the leakage current problem encountered in photovoltaic (PV) applications, which means the proposed circuit is suitable for use in PV applications. Moreover, the circuit also possesses reduced overall components and voltage stress on switches. At the same time, the dual boosting feature is another salient feature of the proposed MLI. This means the input voltage is stepped up two times and we get boosted/increased voltage at the output. The various simulation and experimental conditions have been tried to test the circuit under different load situations. Moreover, the loss analysis using PLECS software tool has been done to get information about the circuit losses. The results are shown and explained in the concerned sections of the paper.

In May 2020, a leaf spot disease of M. macclurei was found on the campus of Jiangxi Agricultural University (28°45′56″N, 115°50′21″E). Approximately 25% (9 out of 35) of 32-year-old M. macclurei trees showed the leaf spot disease. On average, 40% of the leaves per individual tree were affected. The symptoms began as small dark brown lesions formed along the leaf margins and tips. Lesion centers were sunken with a dark brown border as the disease developed. Thirty pieces (5 × 5 mm) from lesion margins were surface sterilized in 70% ethanol (30 s) and 3% NaOCl (1 min) and rinsed three times with sterile water. Leaf pieces were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated at 25°C. Pure cultures were obtained by monosporic isolation. Sixteen strains with similar morphological characterizations were isolated, and three representative isolates (HX-1, HX-2, and HX-3) were used for morphological and molecular characterization. The three isolates were white, cottony, and light gray on the reverse, producing dark-green pigmentation near the center. The conidia were single celled, straight, hyaline, cylindrical, clavate, and 12.8 to 17.5 × 4.5 to 5.7 μm (14.7 ± 1.2 × 4.8 ± 0.2 μm, n = 100). Appressoria were brown to dark brown, ovoid to clavate, and 5.9 to 8.8 × 4.4 to 6.7 μm (7.1 ± 0.6 × 5.6 ± 0.6 μm, n = 100). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions, actin (ACT), calmodulin (CAL), chitin synthase (CHS-1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and beta-tubulin2 (TUB2) were sequenced using the primers ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), ACT-512F/ACT-783R, CL1/CL2, CHS-79F/CHS-345R, GDF/GDR, and T1/Bt2b, respectively (Weir et al. 2012). The sequences were deposited into GenBank (accession nos. MZ323328, MZ323329, MW581269 for ITS; MZ889002, MZ889003, MW661166 for ACT; MZ889004, MZ889005, MW661167 for CAL; MZ889006, MZ889007, MW661168 for CHS-1; MZ889008, MZ889009, MW661169 for GAPDH; MZ889010, MZ889011, MW661170 for TUB2). Maximum likelihood and Bayesian posterior probability-based analyses using IQ-tree v. 1.6.8 and Mr. Bayes v. 3.2.6 with the concatenated sequences (ITS, ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, and TUB2) placed three isolates in the clade of Colletotrichum siamense Prihastuti, L. Cai & K. D. Hyde. Based on the morphological characteristics and molecular data, three isolates were identified as C. siamense (Fu et al. 2019). The pathogenicity of each isolate was tested on potted 2-year-old seedlings of M. macclurei grown in a greenhouse at 25°C, 70% relative humidity, with a 12-h photoperiod. Twenty healthy leaves on 10 M. macclurei plants were inoculated with 10 μl of spore suspension (106 conidia/ml). Another 20 healthy leaves were inoculated with sterile water as the control. All leaves were wounded with a sterile needle (Φ = 0.5 mm). The resulting symptoms were similar to those on the original infected plants, whereas the control leaves remained asymptomatic for 8 days after inoculation. C. siamense was consistently reisolated only from the diseased leaves, fulfilling Koch’s postulates. C. siamense can cause leaf diseases in a variety of hosts, such as Salix matsudana (Zhang et al. 2021), Liriodendron chinense [Hemsl.] Sarg. × tulipifera L. (Zhu et al. 2019), and Magnolia grandiflora (Zhou et al. 2022). This is the first report of C. siamense associated with leaf spot disease on M. macclurei in China, and its potential threat should be evaluated in the future. These results will help to develop effective strategies for appropriately managing this newly emerging disease.The author(s) declare no conflict of interest.References:Fu, M., et al. 2019.

Attempts to identify markers closely linked to Sr48 using available genomic resources were futile. This study used an Arina/Cezanne F5:7 RIL population to identify markers closely linked with Sr48. Using the Arina/Cezanne DArTseq map, Sr48 was mapped on the short arm of chromosome 2D and it co-segregated with 12 markers. These DArTseq marker sequences were used for BlastN search to identify corresponding wheat chromosome survey sequence (CSS) contigs, and PCR-based markers were developed. Two simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, sun590 and sun592, and two Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR (KASP) markers were derived from the contig 2DS_5324961 that mapped distal to Sr48. Molecular cytogenetic analysis using sequential fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) identified a terminal translocation of chromosome 2A in chromosome 2DL of Forno. This translocation would have led to the formation of a quadrivalent involving chromosomes 2A and 2D in the Arina/Forno population, which would have exhibited pseudo-linkage between Sr48 and Yr1 in chromosome 2AL. Polymorphism of the closet marker sunKASP_239 among a set of 178 wheat genotypes suggested that this marker can be used for marker-assisted selection of Sr48.",en,2,8634980.130985836,19,"{'Biology': 51981, 'Sociology': 54976, 'Philosophy': 50113, 'Environmental science': 28477, 'Geology': 4069, 'Psychology': 10565, 'Geography': 21952, 'Political science': 19359, 'Art': 27794, 'Medicine': 13049, 'History': 41214, 'Chemistry': 7027, 'Mathematics': 3869, 'Economics': 5910, 'Computer science': 17079, 'Business': 8401, 'Materials science': 1327, 'Engineering': 3474, 'Physics': 2490}",1.0

Game theory is suitable to manage the interactive driving decision modelling, however, common approaches of multi-player game formulation is computationally complex for dynamic and intense interactions. To overcome this challenge, a global sorting-local gaming framework, namely GLOSO-LOGA, is proposed to solve the intersection interaction problem for autonomous driving, which can comprehensively consider the advantages of multi-vehicle collaboration and single-vehicle intelligence approaches. Further, an interaction disturbance function is used to quantify the impact of indirect interactions on ego vehicle.

This paper considers the implementation and test of a software and hardware framework for decentralised control of aerial vehicles within intensely used airspace. Up to 10 rotary wing vehicles of maximum all up mass of 1 kg are flown in an outdoor volume with length scale of 100 m with GPS and WiFi connectivity. Flight control is implemented using a Pixhawk 4 flight controller running the PX4 firmware with guidance algorithms run on a separate onboard companion computer. Deconfliction is implemented using a simple elastic repulsion model with a guidance update rate of 10 Hz . Traffic structures are constructed from a path of directed waypoints and associated cross sectional geometry. Junctions are implemented when two paths converge into one or when one path diverges into two. Agents engage with structures through execution of flow, merge and swirl velocity rules. Calibration experiments showed that the worst case latency in agents sharing position information was of the order of 0 . 5 s made up from delays due to finite guidance update rate, WiFi processing and centralised message processing. A choice of vehicle cruise speed of 2 m/s and conflict radius of 2 . 5 m provided an acceptable compromise between experiment time efficiency (speed) and spatial efficiency (resolution) within the test volume. Results from recirculating junction experiments show that peak deconfliction activity occurs at the junction node, however biased distribution of agents within a corridor means the peak intensity is pushed ahead of the node. Use of meshed helical junction structures significantly reduces the intensity of conflict at the expense of reduced junction time efficiency.",en,2,11224360.84294007,19,"{'Computer science': 66303, 'Political science': 27859, 'Engineering': 18024, 'Environmental science': 40355, 'Geography': 34813, 'History': 49446, 'Medicine': 10839, 'Mathematics': 47362, 'Psychology': 17814, 'Art': 21665, 'Physics': 2688, 'Sociology': 50715, 'Business': 14847, 'Economics': 10300, 'Geology': 1758, 'Materials science': 2029, 'Philosophy': 22807, 'Biology': 3768, 'Chemistry': 2392}",1.0

Several previous works have proposed concepts and algorithms that help maintain high quality CSI even in the presence of high mobility and channel aging, such as temporal prediction schemes that employ neural networks. However, it is still unclear which neural network-based scheme provides the best performance in terms of prediction quality, training complexity and practical feasibility. To investigate such a question, this paper first provides an overview of state-of-the-art neural networks applicable to channel prediction and compares their performance in terms of prediction quality. Next, a new comparative analysis is proposed for four promising neural networks with different prediction horizons. The well-known tapped delay channel model recommended by the Third Generation Partnership Program is used for a standardized comparison among the neural networks.

The model first utilizes Gaussian interaction kernel similarity for data filling to reduce data sparsity, and inputs each similarity data into the graph convolutional network module for feature embedding. Each embedding is considered as a channel, ultimately forming multiple channels of miRNA and disease mixed data; Next, the effective channel attention module is used to obtain the weights of each channel, and the channel features and attention weights are multiplied before nonlinear activation to obtain the updated feature map; Finally, an information aggregator is used to aggregate the embeddings output from each channel and input them into the classifier to obtain the corresponding prediction score.

However, while standard Cosmological Constant Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model has been well constrained and parts of extended cosmology have been intensively studied, the physics behind them aspects restrains our possibilities of selecting the best cosmological model that can show a significant difference from the first model. Therefore, to explore a possible deviation from a such model that can explain the current discrepancy on the $H_0$ value, in this work we consider adding the current local observables, e.g. Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa), $H(z)$ measurements, and Baryon Acoustic Observations (BAO) combined with two new calibrated Quasars (QSO) datasets using ultraviolet, x-ray and optical plane techniques. While these can be identified as part of the high-redshift standard candle objects, the main characteristics of these are based on fluxes distributions calibrated up to $z \sim 7 $. We consider five $H_0$ prior scenarios to develop these calibrations. Furthermore, we found that our estimations provide the possibility to relax the $H_0$ tension at 2$\sigma$ using a QSO ultraviolet sample in combination with late measurements showing higher values of $H_0$.

Loosely speaking, a $G$-torsor over $k$-variety is said to be versal if it specializes to every $G$-torsor over any $k$-field. The existence of versal torsors is well-known. We show that there exist $G$-torsors that admit even stronger versality properties. For example, for every $d\in\mathbb{N}$, there exists a $G$-torsor over a smooth quasi-projective $k$-scheme that specializes to every torsor over a quasi-projective $k$-scheme after removing some codimension-$d$ closed subset from the latter. Moreover, such specializations are abundant in a well-defined sense. Similar results hold if we replace $k$ with an arbitrary base-scheme. In the course of the proof we show that every globally generated rank-$n$ vector bundle over a $d$-dimensional $k$-scheme of finite type can be generated by $n+d$ global sections. When $G$ can be embedded in a group scheme of unipotent upper-triangular matrices, we further show that there exist $G$-torsors specializing to every $G$-torsor over any affine $k$-scheme. We show that the converse holds when $\operatorname{char} k=0$. We apply our highly versal torsors to show that, for fixed $m,n\in\mathbb{N}$, the symbol length of any degree-$m$ period-$n$ Azumaya algebra over any local $\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{n},e^{2\pi i/n}]$-ring is uniformly bounded.

It well solves the dependence among the nonstationary variates while classic multivariate linear regression dose not. The real-world applications demonstrate its versatility and robustness. However, the statistical significance of this new model needs to be further improved mathematically not just empirically. Hence, the main motivation of this paper is to provide a solid theoretical basis for the latest regression framework. Specifically, four propositions and three theorems are deduced theoretically to support the statistical significance test of detrending-moving-average-based multivariate linear regression model. These propositions and theorems revolve around hypothesis testing of each partial regression coefficients and regression model. They can examine the statistical significance at every given scales. Moreover, we also resort to synthetic time series to verify the performances of the proposed statistical test procedure.

Its strong destructive force often causes serious damage to submarine utilities on its course of movement. The sediment concentration of the sediment flow determines its density difference with the ambient seawater, and this density difference determines the flow ability of the sediment flow, and thus affects the final deposition locations of the transported sediment. In this paper, sediment flows of different sediment concentration with various silt and clay weight ratios (referred to as silt/clay ratio) are studied using flume tests. Our test results indicate that there is a critical sediment concentration at which sediment flows travel the fastest for a specific sediment composition. The critical sediment concentrations and their corresponding maximum velocities for each of the four silt/clay ratios are obtained. The results further indicate that the clay content is linearly negatively correlated with the critical sediment concentration. As the sediment concentration increases, the flow behaviors of sediment flows transform from the flow state to the collapsed state, and the fluid properties of the two turbid suspensions with changing flow behaviors are both Bingham fluids.

It is abundant and continuously replenished in the paranasal sinuses of the respiratory system in healthy adults. Studies have demonstrated that nasal Nitric Oxide levels in the airways increase multifold during humming compared to quiet nasal exhalation. Humming during exhalation is an integral part of Bhramari Pranayama. Objectives: This review is to understand how humming is associated with Nitric Oxide production, and evaluate the suitability of Bhramari Pranayama, and the classical version of Bhramari Pranayama, which has humming as its integral part, for the application of maintenance of the airway integrity. Method: We have searched relevant current scientific literature pertaining to Nitric Oxide, voice production especially humming. We also reviewed the classical yoga texts where Bhramari Pranayama is elaborated. We tried to correlate how Bhramari Pranayama may help to endogenously produce Nitric Oxide and thereby regulate various respiratory functions. We made special efforts to distinguish between general and classical versions of the practice of Bhramari Pranayama. Findings: Experimental evidence suggests that humming significantly influences Nitric Oxide production. Bhramari Pranayama which has humming as its integral part may therefore facilitate Nitric Oxide production endogenously, both during inhalation and exhalation, and thereby help in the regulation of respiratory processes. Novelty: Research to date, has been done on increased expression of Nitric Oxide during humming (during exhalation). The classical version of Bhramari Pranayama which also includes humming during inhalation also known as inhalation phonation, alternating with humming during exhalation seems to offer a wholesome solution for increased stimulation of Nitric Oxide as well as the optimal end use of the much sought-after molecule.

The use of concrete with a clinker-free binder in construction makes it possible to reduce the need for a scarce building material – cement. Studies of the physical and mechanical properties of glass-slag expanded clay concrete grades M50+M150 with a bulk density of 1,000–1,400 kg/m3 were carried out under a short-term static load. At the same time, the strength and deformation properties of glass-slag expanded clay concrete were studied under short-term action of compressive and tensile loads. The use of any new building material must be preceded by a comprehensive study of it – determination of its strength properties, study of concrete in the structure under load, etc. Building codes and regulations are adopted for the standard construction material, the properties of aggregates are not taken into account. Our studies show that the properties of fillers increase the strength properties of the structure when using claydite concrete on a glass-slag binder in reinforced concrete structures",en,2,45705603.469329,19,"{'Engineering': 47512, 'Geography': 120851, 'Sociology': 186609, 'Mathematics': 36013, 'Art': 102783, 'Environmental science': 142852, 'Political science': 99539, 'History': 226181, 'Materials science': 201953, 'Psychology': 61121, 'Chemistry': 40718, 'Geology': 22966, 'Philosophy': 142637, 'Business': 100221, 'Physics': 13031, 'Economics': 48309, 'Computer science': 50897, 'Medicine': 20255, 'Biology': 7116}",1.0

Situated in the western Hindu Kush zone, these marbles are part of the Afghanistan-North Pamir Folded Region, surrounded by faulted structural units. Despite the lack of detailed information from the Afghanistan Geological Survey, including maps and reserve estimates, there has yet to be a comprehensive evaluation of the marble's quality, physical-mechanical properties, or material composition. Furthermore, research and exploration efforts in this area have been limited. The paper aims to discuss and provide conclusions and suggestions regarding petrographic properties, mineral paragenesis, and physical-mechanical characteristics. The marbles predominantly comprise calcite, constituting around 99% of the composition. Spectrometry analysis reveals the presence of elements and oxides such as calcium, aluminum, iron, magnesium, sodium, silicon, and strontium. The physical-mechanical properties of the Salang marbles, including specific gravity (2.70), bulk density (2.69 g/cm3), marble durability index (98.52 MPa), and resistance to impact value (16.38 GPa) of marble aggregates, are analyzed. This research involves collecting specimens from the mine area and conducting mechanical tests and petrographic studies following established norms and standards.

Using spatial analysis and data from geocoded World Bank aid projects, this article investigates international aid effectiveness and aid spillovers at the sub-national level in 3,764 second-order administrative divisions (ADM2) in 48 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa over the period of 1995–2014. The empirical analysis is based on an instrumental variable approach and relies on nightlights data as a proxy for economic activity. The empirical results reveal three previously undocumented findings on aid effectiveness. First, we find that aid at the local level (ADM2) promotes economic growth at an economically and statistically significant level. Second, we uncover significantly positive aid spillovers across adjacent localities (ADM2). Third, aid flows at more aggregate levels (ADM1 and country level) have the opposite effect and reduce economic growth. The net effect of all aid variables is near zero and is within the range of coefficient estimates reported at the country level by previous papers.

Kuntze is widely cultivated in China for its ornamental and economic value. In August 2019, leaf spot was observed on N. nagi plants at the campus of Jiangxi Agricultural University (28°45′56″N, 115°50′21″E). Disease incidence was about 35%, and the diseased leaf rate was above 40%. The early symptoms were small spots on the edge or tip of leaves. The spots gradually expanded and became reddish-brown, eventually developing large irregular lesions. Leaf pieces (5 × 5 mm) from the lesion borders were surfaced sterilized in 70% ethanol for 30 s, followed by 2% NaOCl for 1 min, and rinsed three times with sterile water. Tissues were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated at 25°C (Zhang et al. 2021). Pure cultures were obtained by transferring hyphal tips to new PDA plates. Twenty-six isolates of Colletotrichum spp. were obtained (isolation frequency about 82%). Three representative single-spore isolates (ZB-1, ZB-3, and ZB-7) were used for morphological studies and phylogenetic analyses. Colonies on PDA medium of the three isolates were white to gray with cottony mycelia. Conidia were single celled, straight, hyaline, cylindrical, clavate, and 14.1 to 17.9 × 4.4 to 6.8 μm (15.6 ± 1.2 × 5.4 ± 0.3 μm, n = 100). Appressoria were brown to dark brown, ovoid to clavate, slightly irregular to irregular, and 5.7 to 9.3 × 4.6 to 6.9 μm (7.8 ± 0.2 × 5.6 ± 0.3 μm, n = 100). Morphological features were similar to the Colletotrichum siamense complex (Weir et al. 2012). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions, actin (ACT), calmodulin (CAL), β-tubulin 2 (TUB2), chitin synthase (CHS-1), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were amplified from genomic DNA for the three isolates using primers ITS1/ITS4, ACT-512F/ACT-783R, CL1/CL2, T1/Bt2b, CHS-79F/CHS-354R, and GDF/GDR (Weir et al. 2012), respectively. Sequences were deposited in GenBank under OL826760 to OL826762 (ITS), OL830205 to OL830207 (ACT), OL830196 to OL830198 (GAPDH), OL830193 to OL830195 (TUB2), OL830199 to OL830201 (CHS-1), and OL830202 to OL830204 (CAL). A BLAST search of GenBank showed that the ITS, ACT, GAPDH, TUB2, CHS-1, and CAL sequences of the three isolates were identical to C. siamense at a high level. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian posterior probability analyses using IQtree v. 1.6.8 and Mr. Bayes v. 3.2.6 with the concatenated sequences placed ZB-1, ZB-3, and ZB-7 in the clade of C. siamense. Based on the multilocus phylogeny and morphology, the three isolates were identified as C. siamense. The pathogenicity of the three isolates was tested on six N. nagi plants (three for inoculation, three for controls), which were grown in the field. Six healthy leaves were wounded with a sterile needle and inoculated with 10 μl of conidial suspension (1 × 106 conidia/ml) per plant. Healthy leaves were inoculated with ddH2O as a control by the same method. All the inoculated leaves were covered with plastic bags to keep a high-humidity environment for 2 days. The experiment was repeated three times. All the inoculated leaves showed similar symptoms to those observed in the field, but control leaves were asymptomatic for 8 days. C. siamense was reisolated from the lesions, but no fungus was isolated from control leaves. Cephleuros virescens, Pestalotiopsis longisetula, Alternaria tenuissima, A. alternata, and Phoma glomerata have been known to infect N. nagi (Zhang et al. 2016; Zhou et al. 2015) and cause leaf spots in China. To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. siamense causing leaf spots on N. nagi worldwide.

In September 2020, a survey was undertaken to identify pathogenic fungi associated with corn ear rot in Suihua city (46.63°N and 126.98°E), Heilongjiang Province, China. The average disease incidence was 14.2 and 15.6% in each of two fields sampled (∼5 ha) using a five-point method (100 plants/point). Twenty tissue samples from 20 diseased ears, showing white or pink mold on the surface of corn ears, were surface disinfected in 0.5% NaOCl for 5 min and rinsed three times in autoclaved distilled water. After drying, four treated corn kernels (one kernel/ear) were placed onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with 50 μg/ml of streptomycin. The plates were sealed with Parafilm and cultured in the dark at 26°C with 80% RH for 3 days in an incubator. A total of 12 morphologically similar fungal isolates were obtained and subcultured by transferring hyphal tips for 3 to 5 days. Single-conidium isolates were generated with methods reported previously (Leslie and Summerell 2006). Colonies on PDA, reaching 20.3 to 20.9 mm·day−1 at 26°C, consisted of white to pale yellow, flocculent, lush, dense aerial mycelium with red to apricot color. Macroconidia of six isolates randomly selected on carnation leaf agar (CLA) were falciform with a foot cell, three to six septate, and 12.6 to 67.2 × 2.6 to 5.4 μm (n = 100) in the dark at 26°C with 80% RH for 5 days. No microconidia were observed. Based on these characteristics, the isolates were preliminarily identified as Fusarium asiaticum (Chang et al. 2020; Leslie and Summerell 2006). Genomic DNA of three representative isolates, YSF2, YSF4, and YSF7, were extracted and the translation elongation factor 1-α (TEF-1ɑ) gene was amplified and sequenced using the primers EF1-728F/EF1-986R (Carbone and Kohn 1999). The DNA sequences of YSF2, YSF4, and YSF7 were deposited in GenBank (OL631287.1, OP272129, and OP272130). Analysis of TEF-1ɑ sequences of YSF2, YSF4, and YSF7 showed that they were 100% identical to F. asiaticum isolates NRRL 26156 (AF212452.1) in NCBI and NRRL 13818 (AF212451.1) in Fusarium MLST. A pathogenicity test was performed on corn cv. Xinxin 1. Four days after silk emergence, 3 ml of conidial suspension (106 macroconidia/ml) of each of the 12 isolates was individually injected into the center of the ear through the husk sideways, penetrating the kernels to a depth of about 5 mm (6 ears/isolate) in the field (Guo et al. 2020). Six corn ears treated with sterile distilled water were used as the control. After inoculation, normal field management was carried out. All inoculated ears showed symptoms similar to those observed in the field 50 days after inoculation, while no symptoms were observed on the blank control ears. Five fungal isolates with the same colony morphology as the naturally occurring ear rot in the field were reisolated from the inoculated corn kernels and confirmed to be F. asiaticum according to morphological characteristics and sequence analysis of five fungal isolates. F. asiaticum has previously been reported to cause corn ear rot in Japan (Kawakami et al. 2015). To our knowledge, this is the first report of F. asiaticum causing corn ear rot in Northeast China. Corn ear rot poses a threat to significantly reduce the quality of corn in a major production zone of maize in China. Therefore, its distribution needs to be investigated and effective disease management strategies developed.The author(s) declare no conflict of interest.References:Carbone, I., and Kohn, L. M. 1999.

This article, inspired by the perspective of Kuder’s personal match, used the research approach of story listening and evaluated the learning effects after students listened to seniors sharing their stories in high school. The effects of learning from seniors’ thoughts and identifying with seniors, which could impact students’ academic achievement, learning resilience, and role modeling, were evaluated by assessing the recognition of self-advantages and self-efficacy based on overcoming obstacles. An experimental longitudinal study was selected as the research design, and a sample of 218 students from three different high schools near Taipei was selected; repeated measures ANOVA and multiple regression were selected to examine the results. Comparing the pre- and post-test scores, the results showed that &amp;quot;&amp;quot;there was&amp;quot;&amp;quot; a significant difference between the experimental and comparison groups in the variable of learning from seniors’ thoughts, but no significant difference in the variable of identifying with seniors.. Meanwhile, there was a significant difference between the two groups in the variables of self-advantages and self-efficacy across the three time intervals; the performance of the experimental group showed an upward trend, while the performance of the comparison group showed a downward trend. In addition, learning resilience at t3 was influenced by the variable of learning from seniors’ thoughts at t2 through the mediation effects of recognizing self-advantages, and academic achievement at t3 was affected by learning from seniors’ thoughts at t2 via the mediation effects of self-efficacy from overcoming obstacles at t2. Furthermore, role modeling at t3 can be shaped by identifying seniors at t2 with the medication effects of self-efficacy from overcoming obstacles at t2. This shows that we can use the story listening approach to reframe the concept of personal matching, which can facilitate two psychological mechanisms that create two different effects. Similarly, it reveals that the intervention effects of story listening on the variable of learning from seniors’ thoughts are more substantial than identifying with seniors as well as enhancing the ability to recognize self-advantages and improving self-efficacy from overcoming obstacles longitudinally. In college counseling, counselors can provide different stories and experiences to help students prepare their academic portfolios with confidence and be successful in college applications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",en,2,0.0,0,{},0.0

Despite a lack of performance data, lithium disilicate crowns have been bonded to retentive elements in PEKK frameworks. Purpose The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the bond strengths and flexibility of lithium disilicate to PEKK or zirconia. Material and methods Forty-five PEKK, 15 zirconia, and 60 lithium disilicate beam-shaped specimens (12.5×2×2 mm) were fabricated. The ends of the PEKK beams were subjected to 3 different surface treatments before the application and light polymerization of a primer: 50-μm aluminum oxide airborne-particle abrasion, nonthermal air plasma, and argon-oxygen plasma. The zirconia specimen bonding surfaces were prepared with 50-μm aluminum oxide airborne-particle abrasion and the application of primer. Lithium disilicate specimens were etched with 4.5% hydrofluoric acid, and primer was applied. The lithium disilicate specimens were luted with an adhesive resin cement to the PEKK and zirconia specimens by using light-activated and chemically activated polymerization. Fifteen monolithic specimens of PEKK, lithium disilicate, and zirconia (25×2×2 mm) were also fabricated. All specimens were incubated overnight in 100% humidity before testing. Bonded and monolithic specimens were loaded in a universal testing machine, and 4-point bend tests were conducted until failure (n=15). The flexural modulus and strength were calculated and statistically analyzed with 1-way analysis of variance and Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc tests (α=.05). Results All bonded specimens failed at the adhesive interface. The zirconia-lithium disilicate bond strength was approximately twice that of the strongest group of PEKK (airborne-particle abrasion group) bonded to lithium disilicate (42 ±12 MPa and 24 ±13 MPa, respectively) and was approximately 9 times more rigid (71 ±19 GPa and 8 ±2 GPa, respectively). Monolithic PEKK fractured at 238 ±22 MPa, monolithic zirconia at 771 ±128 MPa, and monolithic lithium disilicate at 173 ±26 MPa. Monolithic PEKK was approximately 30 times more flexible than monolithic zirconia (6 ±1 GPa and 178 ±16 GPa, respectively). All values were statistically significantly different (P<.05), except for the bond strength between lithium disilicate and PEKK treated with airborne-particle abrasion and nonthermal air plasma and the flexural moduli of PEKK to lithium disilicate. Conclusions Bond strength between PEKK and lithium disilicate was significantly weaker than that between zirconia and lithium disilicate. Monolithic PEKK was significantly more flexible than monolithic zirconia.",en,2,0.0,1,{'Medicine': 3610},0.0

Here, using a Japanese gecko Gekko japonicus, we investigated whether geckos have a light preference and how foraging experiences under the light reinforce light approaching tendency. In a comparative experiment, there was no difference in light approaching behavior between urban and suburban geckos irrespective of their original light habitats. In an associative learning experiment, geckos did not significantly change light approaching behavior even after repeated opportunities to forage crickets near a lamp in the laboratory setting. These results imply that light approaching behavior of Japanese geckos may not be easily reinforced by foraging experiences under the light.

The CO2 respired by maple and oak shoots was 13C-enriched relative to δ13CB during spring, but not late summer or in the stem. In cedar, δ13CR did not vary significantly throughout organs and seasons, with respired CO2 being 13C-depleted relative to δ13CB. Shoot δ13CR was positively related to leaf starch concentration in maple, while stem δ13CR was inversely related to stem growth. These relations were not significant for oak or cedar.

Donor-derived transmission of infections is a rare complication of kidney transplant. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is a common cause of acute viral hepatitis worldwide, but donor-derived transmission to organ recipients has been reported in the literature only twice previously. The timeline for HAV incubation and clearance in transplant recipients is not well understood. Methods. In 2018, 2 kidneys and a liver were procured from a deceased donor resident of Kentucky, one of many states that was experiencing an HAV outbreak associated with person-to-person transmission through close contact, primarily among people who reported drug use. Both kidney recipients, residents of Virginia, subsequently developed acute HAV infections. We report the results of an investigation to determine the source of transmission and describe the clinical course of HAV infection in the infected kidney recipients. Results. The liver recipient had evidence of immunity to HAV and did not become infected. The donor and both kidney recipients were found to have a genetically identical strain of HAV using a next-generation sequencing-based cyber molecular assay (Global Hepatitis Outbreak Surveillance Technology), confirming donor-derived HAV infections in kidney recipients. At least 1 kidney recipient experienced delayed development of detectable hepatitis A anti-IgM antibodies. By 383 and 198 d posttransplant, HAV RNA was no longer detectable in stool specimens from the left and right kidney recipients, respectively. Conclusions.

These expenses are often overlooked by clinicians, even in countries with publicly funded healthcare systems. Parking fees are one such category of expenses that contribute to financial toxicity in cancer care. Patients with cancer often have protracted treatment courses, especially if they are receiving external beam radiation therapy. It is not clear if cancer center parking fees influence city-specific indices such as city-specific cost of living. The aim of this study was to evaluate cancer center parking fees in Western Canada and to elucidate any correlation between daily cost of parking and the city-specific indices.This was a cross sectional study conducted from February 1st, 2022, to March 1st, 2022. An online search was undertaken to obtain the publicly available parking information for the regional and community cancer centers in the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan. Telephone calls were made with parking offices or switchboards to obtain this information for the cancer centers that did not have online information on parking. Cancer center address transit scores, median city household income, and city-specific cost of living scores were obtained online for the cities where the cancer centers were located. Pearson correlation and a zero-inflated negative binomial model were used for statistical analysis.Data was collected from 115 community and regional cancer centers distributed across the 4 provinces. The median hourly parking fee across all provinces was 2.00 Canadian Dollars (CAD) (Interquartile range (IQR), 0-4.25), whereas the median daily cost of parking was 9.50 CAD (IQR, 0-13.13). The median cancer center address transit score was 41.00 (IQR, 12.00-50.50). There was a statistically significant (p=0.029) positive correlation between the daily cost of parking and city cost of living. The correlation coefficient between the two variables was 0.412. Furthermore, there was a statistically significant (p<0.001) positive correlation between daily cost of parking and cancer center address transit score. The correlation coefficient between the two variables was 0.676. In addition, there was a strong negative correlation between the cancer center address transit score and the presence of free parking with a correlation coefficient of -0.613 (p<0.001). There was a nonsignificant (p=0.88) negative correlation between cost of living and the presence of free parking with a correlation coefficient of -0.028.The results of this study demonstrate that daily cost of parking for community and regional cancer centers in Western Canada significantly influences city-specific cost of living and cancer center address transit scores to a varying degree. This demonstrates that the influence of parking fees on patients with cancer is multilayered with significant direct and indirect effects. This can contribute to loss of wage and added financial burden on patients and their caregivers in higher-cost provinces. The presence of free parking at community and regional cancer centers had a statistically significant negative correlation with the cancer center address transit score. This suggests that cities with more free parking also have less robust public transit systems. Conversely, the presence of an extensive public transit system leads to a lower likelihood of free parking being available at cancer centers.The presence of a strong public healthcare system does not necessarily address all aspects of cancer-related financial toxicity.

Body image perceptions among adolescents are intrinsically linked to psychological factors such as self-esteem and social comparison. The secondary stage proves to be a critical period for exploring identity, with body image playing a vital role in shaping mental well-being and interpersonal relationships. Aim. The current research aims to examine the differences and to identify the relationship between adolescents in body image and some psychological variables (life satisfaction – psychological adaptation) according to the gender variable (males – females). Methodology and research methods. The sample of the current research consisted of 433 adolescents, with 220 male students and 213 female students; their ages ranged between 16–19 years. To achieve the research objectives, the author adopted the descriptive correlative approach to conduct this study, in addition to using the scale of body image, life satisfaction, and scale of psychological adaptation. After verifying the stability and validity of the tools, they were applied to the study sample. Results. The results revealed differences between male and female adolescents in body image in favour of adolescents, meaning that adolescents are more satisfied with their body image than female adolescents. In addition, there are differences between male and female adolescents in the degree of psychological adjustment in favour of adolescents. However, there are no differences between male and female adolescents in the degree of life satisfaction and there is a positive, statistically significant correlation between life satisfaction and psychological adjustment. Furthermore, there is a positive, statistically significant relationship between the body image scale and the psychological adjustment scale. Scientific novelty. The scientific novelty of this study lies in its comprehensive investigation into the complex interplay between body image and various psychological variables among adolescents in the secondary stage. This study adds to scientific knowledge in several ways. First, it provides insights into the complex relationship between body image and psychological variables among adolescents in the secondary stage, which can inform future research in this area. Second, the study’s findings on gender differences in body image and psychological adjustment can contribute to our understanding of how gender affects mental health outcomes in adolescence.

Nowadays, XR video streaming service is evolving to high definition (HD), which results in massive data traffic with more stringent latency requirement. Due to the two characteristics, it is challenging to support the commercial use for XR service in the current New Ratio (NR) network. In this paper, we propose a real-time super-resolution (RTSR) framework for XR HD video transmission. The basic idea is to utilize the overfitting feature of Deep Neural Network (DNN) to learn the non-linear mapping between low-definition (LD) video frames and HD video frames. The cloud XR server can transmit the LD frames together with the dedicated super resolution (SR) models instead of sending HD frames directly. The receiver can recover the HD frames locally with the inferencing ability of SR model. In addition, by introducing the online training and layered transmission strategy, the SR model update period can be adaptively adjusted according to the scenario changes, which also reduces the transmission overhead. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed RTSR, which can save up to 50% traffic and increase the XR capacity about 40% compared with the conventional SR scheme. In terms of the system capacity, our results show that the average number of UEs can reach about 23 per cell under the common settings of Dense Urban.",en,2,10952621.199662829,19,"{'Computer science': 92368, 'Political science': 28211, 'Engineering': 14259, 'Environmental science': 41085, 'Geography': 36612, 'History': 50384, 'Medicine': 11124, 'Mathematics': 47457, 'Psychology': 18090, 'Art': 26793, 'Physics': 2724, 'Sociology': 51120, 'Business': 14918, 'Economics': 10414, 'Geology': 1758, 'Materials science': 2029, 'Philosophy': 23227, 'Biology': 4934, 'Chemistry': 2392}",1.0

In particular, quadrilateral and hexahedral elements are required to be convex. However, generating high quality tangle-free meshes, especially 3D hexahedral meshes, remains an open challenge. Recently, the tangled finite element method (TFEM) was proposed to handle concave (tangled) quadrilateral elements. However, even in 2D, it was found to be computationally expensive and programmatically complex. Here, we present a computationally efficient isoparametric-TFEM (i-TFEM) framework for inverted 2D quadrilateral and 3D hexahedral elements. i-TFEM employs the properties of isoparametric elements to make the formulation computationally much more efficient. In i-TFEM, the constraint on full invertibility (convexity) is replaced by partial invertibility by modifying the elemental stiffness matrices of the concave elements, and by incorporating certain piecewise-compatibility conditions. The proposed i-TFEM is simple, efficient, and provides accurate solutions with optimal convergence rate even in the presence of severely inverted elements. Moreover, i-TFEM requires minimal changes to the standard FEM framework and reduces to standard FEM for meshes without tangled elements. The accuracy and efficiency of i-TFEM are demonstrated by solving elastostatics problems on several 2D and 3D tangled meshes.",en,2,0.0,0,{},0.0

Three tool pin eccentricities of 0, 0.2, and 0.8 mm at different welding speeds ranging from 100 mm/min to 500 mm/min and a constant tool rotation rate of 600 rpm were investigated. High-resolution electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD) data were acquired from each weld’s center of the nugget zone (NG) and processed to analyze the grain structure and texture. In terms of mechanical properties, both hardness and tensile properties were investigated. The grain structure in the NG of the joints produced at 100 mm/min, 600 rpm, and different tool pin eccentricities showed significant grain refining due to dynamic recrystallization with average grain sizes of 18, 15, and 18 µm at 0, 0.2, and 0.8 mm pin eccentricities, respectively. Increasing the welding speed from 100 to 500 mm/min further reduced the average grain size of the NG zone to 12.4, 10, and 11 µm at 0, 0.2, and 0.8 mm eccentricity, respectively. The simple shear texture dominates the crystallographic texture with both B¯/B texture component with the C component at their ideal positions after rotating the data to align the shear reference frame with the FSW reference frame in both the PFs and ODF sections. The tensile properties of the welded joints were slightly lower than the base material due to the hardness reduction in the weld zone. However, the ultimate tensile strength and the yield stress for all welded joints increased by increasing the friction stir welding (FSW) speed from 100 to 500 mm/min. Welding using the pin eccentricity of 0.2 mm resulted in the highest tensile strength; at a welding speed of 500 mm/min, it reached 97% of the base material strength. The hardness profile showed the typical W shape with a reduction in the hardness of the weld zone and a slight recovery of the hardness in the NG zone.",en,2,1500316.5440894589,19,"{'Materials science': 179609, 'Chemistry': 22536, 'Engineering': 13243, 'Business': 1115, 'Sociology': 9962, 'Art': 3469, 'Political science': 3487, 'History': 9367, 'Economics': 1078, 'Geology': 2166, 'Geography': 5403, 'Mathematics': 796, 'Environmental science': 4699, 'Psychology': 1496, 'Philosophy': 5006, 'Computer science': 1296, 'Medicine': 133, 'Physics': 201, 'Biology': 76}",1.0

Additive manufacturing is well known for its quick fabrication of end-use components. The process parameter described during slicing process will influence the mechanical properties of the additively fabricated components. In this present study, machine learning models such as linear regression, decision tree, random forest, adaboost were used to optimize the process parameters and to predict hardness value for other process parameters. Machine learning models such as linear regression, decision tree, random forest, and adaboost were used to predict the output response. These models were selected to illustrate the variance in performance of various kinds of machine learning model on real-time experimental data. The test specimens were fabricated through fused filament fabrication (FFF). Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) is an engineering thermoplastic used as a feedstock material. The hardness values were determined using a shore D durometer, which is specifically meant to measure the hardness of plastics and rubbers. The design of experiments was evaluated by considering four parameters at three different levels. Infill density, layer thickness, print orientation, and raster orientation are the four parameters, which was taken into account. The robustness and acceptability of four different machine learning models were evaluated at various error metrics. From the results, the adequacy of random forest model is highlighted over other machine learning models. From observation, the value of the co-efficient of determination(R2) for various models ranged from 0.8437 to 0.9136, with the random forest model ranking the highest (0.9136).

The deposits are confined to a narrow zone between the regional NW- to NWW-trending Kalamaili and Qingshui-Sujiquan shear zones and are structurally controlled by secondary, high-angle faults of the regional shear zones. The orebodies occur in the Middle Devonian and Lower Carboniferous strata that are largely composed of zeolite to lower greenschist facies clastic sedimentary and pyroclastic rocks. Gold mineralization occurs as auriferous quartz-sulfide&amp;#177;tourmaline veins/veinlets and disseminated ores in the immediate altered wall rocks. The ore mineralogy is relatively simple and dominated by quartz with minor to trace amounts of sulfides (pyrite and arsenopyrite, typically &lt;5% in volume), sericite, calcite, and gold. The hydrothermal alteration halos are characterized by a proximal, 0.5&amp;#8211;5&amp;#160;m wide zone composed mainly of quartz-sericite (-tourmaline)-sulfide (-gold) and a distal, several to tens of meters wide zone with a calcite-chlorite-epidote assemblage. Hydrothermal processes essentially involve a pre-ore stage of barren quartz, a main-ore stage of quartz-sulfide-gold (&amp;#177;tourmaline), and a post-ore stage of barren quartz-calcite (&amp;#177;sericite).Fluid inclusion microthermometry, stable isotopes, and hydrothermal zircon U-Pb dating were combined to constrain the nature and source of ore fluids, the timing of mineralization, and the mechanism of gold precipitation. The ore-forming fluid of the main-ore stage is uniformly characterized by a medium to high homogenization temperature (mostly 240&amp;#176; to 330&amp;#8451;), low salinity (typically &lt;6 wt % NaCl equiv), reduced, and CO2-rich-H2O-NaCl&amp;#177;CH4 fluid. The hydrogen and oxygen isotope data (&amp;#948;18OH2O=+8.4 to +17.3&amp;#8240;, &amp;#948;DH2O=&amp;#8211;99 to &amp;#8211;62&amp;#8240;) indicate a metamorphic origin for the mineralizing fluid. The majority of &amp;#948;34S values of the sulfides range between 0 and +10&amp;#8240; with a mean of +2&amp;#8240; (n=62), indicative of a largely sedimentary rock reservoir of sulfur in the ore-forming fluids. LA-ICP-MS U-Pb isotope dating of the hydrothermal zircons from auriferous quartz veins yielded a weighted mean 206Pb/238U age of ~313 Ma.Combined geological and geochemical evidence indicates that the transition from compressional to transcurrent deformation during the late- to post-orogeny in the late Carboniferous played a vital role for the gold-bearing fluid flow along regional shear zones and subsequent channeling into the second- and third-order faults. On a deposit scale, fault-valve behavior during seismic fault activity is a key mechanism that caused episodic changes in fluid pressure and the resultant phase separation of ore fluids and precipitation of gold. Sulfidation of wall rocks due to fluid-rock interaction is another important mechanism for the gold precipitation. Later since the Permian, the N-S compression resulted in uplift and exhumation of the East Junggar terrane and deformation of the orebodies. Target gold exploration in this region is suggested to focus on the northeast side of the Kalamaili fault zone, where there exist suitable faults that connect with the first-order fault zones at depth and lead to focused fluid flux into depositional sites at shallower levels.",en,2,21618107.902802013,19,"{'Geography': 113716, 'Sociology': 137095, 'History': 169611, 'Geology': 136330, 'Environmental science': 98245, 'Political science': 61983, 'Philosophy': 79439, 'Business': 29671, 'Art': 63082, 'Economics': 21599, 'Psychology': 25036, 'Mathematics': 13998, 'Engineering': 16028, 'Physics': 7018, 'Medicine': 6946, 'Computer science': 24211, 'Biology': 3274, 'Chemistry': 2471, 'Materials science': 7178}",1.0
https://openalex.org/W4311447028,2023,"['Chemistry', ' Geology']","Chromium stable isotope distributions in the southwest Pacific Ocean and constraints on hydrothermal input from the Kermadec ArcSpecial attention has been given to chromium (Cr) as a paleoproxy tracing redox cycling throughout Earth’s history, due to differences in the solubility of its primary redox species at Earth’s surface (Cr(III) and Cr(VI)) and isotope fractionation associated with their interconversion. In turn, chromium’s paleoproxy potential has motivated studies of the modern ocean to better understand which processes drive its cycling and to constrain their impact on the Cr isotope composition (δ53Cr) of seawater. Here, we present total dissolved seawater Cr concentrations and δ53Cr along the GEOTRACES GP13 section. This section is a zonal transect extending from Australia in the subtropical southwest Pacific Ocean. Surface signals of local biological Cr cycling are minimal, in agreement with distributions of dissolved major nutrients as well as biologically-controlled trace metals in this low productivity, oligotrophic environment. Depth profiles have Cr concentration minima in surface waters and maxima at depth, and are largely shaped by the advection of nutrient- and Cr-rich subsurface waters rather than vertically-driven processes. Samples close to the sediment–water interface indicate important benthic Cr fluxes across the section. The GP13 transect crosses the hydrothermally-active Kermadec Arc. Hydrothermal fluids (consisting of <15% background seawater) were collected from three venting sites at the Brothers Volcano (along the Kermadec Arc). These fluids yielded near-crustal δ53Cr values (−0.17 to +0.08‰) and elevated [Cr] (7.5–23 nmol kg−1, hydrothermal endmember [Cr] ≈ 8–27 nmol kg−1), indicating that the Kermadec Arc may be an isotopically light Cr source. Dissolved [Fe] enrichments have been reported previously in deep waters (∼1600–3000 m) along the GP13 transect, east of the Kermadec Arc. These same waters show elevated [Cr] compared to Circumpolar Deep Water ([Cr] = 3.88 ± 0.11, δ53Cr = 0.89 ± 0.08, n = 32), with an average [Cr] accumulation of 0.71 ± 0.11 nmol kg−1 (1 SD), and an estimated δ53Cr of +0.46 ± 0.30‰ (2 SD, n = 9) for the accumulated Cr. Comparing high-temperature vent and neutrally buoyant plume data, hydrothermal-sourced Cr is likely negligable compared to Cr contributions from other processes (benthic fluxes, release from particles), and the advection of more Cr-rich Pacific Deep Water. It is unlikely that hydrothermal vents would be a major contributor within the regional or global biogeochemical Cr cycle, even if hydrothermal fluxes change by orders of magnitude, and therefore δ53Cr trends in the paleorecord may be attributable, at least in part, to major changes in other controls on Cr (e.g. widespread anoxia).",en,2,1597581.9521446405,19,"{'Chemistry': 25004, 'Geology': 50884, 'Geography': 7118, 'Economics': 6514, 'Materials science': 4351, 'History': 7050, 'Psychology': 7375, 'Environmental science': 9744, 'Computer science': 1428, 'Biology': 3568, 'Mathematics': 1081, 'Sociology': 2065, 'Medicine': 3363, 'Philosophy': 3000, 'Political science': 771, 'Art': 1006, 'Engineering': 160, 'Business': 469, 'Physics': 187}",1.0

Graphics processing unit (GPU) computing has become popular due to the enormous calculation potential that can be harvested from a single card. The N -body integrator Gravitational ENcounters with GPU Acceleration (GENGA) is built to harvest the computing power from such cards, but it suffers a severe performance penalty on consumer-grade Nvidia GPUs due to their artificially truncated double precision performance. Aims. We aim to speed up GENGA on consumer-grade cards by harvesting their high single-precision performance. Methods. We modified GENGA to have the option to compute the mutual long-distance forces between bodies in single precision and tested this with five experiments. First, we ran a high number of simulations with similar initial conditions of on average 6600 fully self-gravitating planetesimals in both single and double precision to establish whether the outcomes were statistically different. These simulations were run on Tesla K20 cards. We supplemented this test with simulations that (i) began with a mixture of planetesimals and planetary embryos, (ii) planetesimal-driven giant planet migration, and (iii) terrestrial planet formation with a dissipating gas disc. All of these simulations served to determine the accuracy of energy and angular momentum conservation under various scenarios with single and double precision forces. Second, we ran the same simulation beginning with 40 000 self-gravitating planetesimals using both single and double precision forces on a variety of consumer-grade and Tesla GPUs to measure the performance boost of computing the long-range forces in single precision. Results. We find that there are no statistical differences when simulations are run with the gravitational forces in single or double precision that can be attributed to the force prescription rather than stochastic effects. The accumulations in uncertainty in energy are almost identical when running with single or double precision long-range forces. However, the uncertainty in the angular momentum using single rather than double precision long-range forces is about two orders of magnitude greater, but still very low. Running the simulations in single precision on consumer-grade cards decreases running time by a factor of three and becomes within a factor of three of a Tesla A100 GPU. Additional tuning speeds up the simulation by a factor of two across all types of cards. Conclusions. The option to compute the long-range forces in single precision in GENGA when using consumer-grade GPUs dramatically improves performance at a little penalty to accuracy. There is an additional environmental benefit because it reduces energy usage.",en,2,0.0,0,{},0.0

The vertical structure of the star formation history across the Solar CylinderAbstract Starting from the Gaia DR3 HR diagram, we derive the star formation history (SFH) as a function of distance from the Galactic Plane within a cylinder centred on the Sun with a 200 pc radius and spanning 1.3 kpc above and below the Galaxy’s midplane. We quantify both the concentration of the more recent star formation in the Galactic Plane, and the age-related increase in the scale height of the Galactic Disc stellar component, which is well-described by power-laws with indices ranging from 1/2 to 2/3. The vertically-integrated star formation rate falls from (1.147 ± 0.039) × 10−8 M⊙yr−1pc−2 at earlier times down to (6.2 ± 3.0) × 10−9 M⊙yr−1pc−2 at present times, but we find a significant peak of star formation in the 2 to 3 Gyr age bin. The total mass of stars formed per unit area over time is 118.7 ± 6.2 M⊙pc−2, which is nearly twice the present stellar mass derived from kinematics within 1 kpc from the Galactic Plane, implying a high degree of matter recycling in successive generations of stars. The method is then modified by adopting an age-dependent correlation between the SFH across the different slices, which results in less noisy and more symmetrical results without significantly changing the previously mentioned quantities.

In this paper, the application principle of dichroic mirrors for biomedical detection was introduced, and some key technical indexes for high-performance dichroic mirrors were proposed according to their application characteristics. With the equivalent layer substitution method, a dichroic mirror film system of high-performance based on two conventional materials was designed. Using the plasma assisted reactive magnetron sputtering technology, the dichroic mirror film system with 146 layers was coated, and a kind of dichroic mirror with some important technical indicators such as high steepness (&lt;1%), depolarization (polarization separation &lt;3.5nm), wide range of high transmission (T&gt;96% range &gt; 300nm) was manufactured. The influence of wavefront distortion of dichroic mirror on imaging was described in detail. Our dichroic mirrors can meet the performance of low transmitted wavefront distortion (TWD&lt;&lambda;/4) and low reflected wavefront distortion (RWD&lt;&lambda;/2).

This limits its application in soft magnetic materials. In this work, the effects of adding a small amount of Mo on the soft magnetic properties, hardness, and microstructure of FeCoNiMox (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.25) MEAs were investigated. The results indicate that a suitable addition of Mo can simultaneously improve the AC soft magnetic properties and hardness of the alloys. When x = 0.15, the total loss (Ps), AC coercivity (AC Hc), and maximum AC applied magnetic field (AC Hm) of the alloy were improved by 41%, 37%, and 38% over those of the x = 0 alloy, respectively. When x = 0.25, the nano-hardness of the alloy is 91% higher than that of the x = 0 alloy. The results of the microstructure analysis show that the appropriate addition of Mo homogenized the microstructure and refined the grains of the alloys. Meanwhile, the addition of Mo also led to the appearance of two FCC phases with alternating distribution and inhibited the formation of dislocation in the alloys. The mechanisms of adding elemental Mo to improve the soft magnetic properties and hardness of the alloys are discussed. Our work provides an effective way to enhance the soft magnetic and mechanical properties of MEA simultaneously.",en,2,896895.1723156906,19,"{'Materials science': 140221, 'Chemistry': 26904, 'Engineering': 6069, 'Business': 798, 'Sociology': 1652, 'Art': 787, 'Political science': 3125, 'History': 1627, 'Computer science': 1749, 'Environmental science': 1824, 'Geography': 912, 'Medicine': 626, 'Economics': 504, 'Geology': 132, 'Mathematics': 169, 'Psychology': 188, 'Philosophy': 382, 'Physics': 125, 'Biology': 19}",1.0

The collection of dust particles contains 197 spherules ranging from 0.5 to 117 μm in diameter, the most abundant ones ( n = 188) by far being iron oxide spherules. Analyses of meteorological and human activity data suggest an extraterrestrial origin of most of the spherical particles. The particle size distribution histogram showed a smooth increase in their number with decreasing size and a dramatic drop at sizes smaller than 3 μm. The number of spherical particles has an uneven distribution over time, with an intense peak in July 27–28, 2017 which correlates by dates with the peak of the Southern Delta Aquariids meteor shower. The size distribution of the particles collected during the same period indicates the presence of a mechanism that accelerates their fall to the Earth. We propose that they are effective centers of condensation of ice crystals in stratospheric clouds.

Previous work shows that these drought patterns can persist on timescales of decades to centuries and are driven by internal climate variability, with secondary influence by sea surface temperatures. However very few high-resolution records of western US precipitation extend beyond the tree ring record (~1400 CE), limiting our understanding of the occurrence and persistence of these patterns of natural climate variability on longer timescales and further in the past. Here we use trace element (Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, Ba/Ca, P/Ca) and stable isotope (&amp;#948;18O, &amp;#948;13C) data from two coeval stalagmites to construct a Holocene paleoclimate record for Titan Cave (TC), northern Wyoming, extending the hydroclimate record of the northern Rockies and providing the opportunity to assess longer-term natural climate variability in the northern Rockies. The TC-2 and TC-7 speleothems grew over the past ~5.7 ka and ~3.1 ka, respectively. Proxies from both stalagmites exhibit strong correlations with several coeval climate records, including regional snowpack as recorded by tree rings during the past ~600 years, suggesting the speleothems record winter precipitation patterns in the northern Rockies. Decreased snowpack and dry conditions at TC correlate to warmer sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Alaska and the positive phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Comparison of speleothem &amp;#948;18O with the &amp;#948;18O of Bison Lake sediments from central Colorado suggests all three patterns of western US drought occurred during intervals of the late Holocene.

In Lahaul, asynchronous timing and extent of late Quaternary glaciation have been reported (Owen et al., 1996, 1997, 2001; Eugster et al., 2016). The established oldest and most extensive Chandra glacial stage remains undated and speculative. We reconstrain the late Quaternary glacial history of the CBB using geomorphological mapping, Infrared Stimulated Luminescence (IRSL), and 10Be Terrestrial Cosmogenic Nuclide (TCN) surface exposure dating. Four local glacial stages, the Chandra, Batal, Dali, and Mayar, are dated to 152 ± 37 ka, 43 ± 3 ka, 21 ± 2 ka, and Little Ice Age (LIA), respectively. The Chandra glacial stage occurred during the late Marine Isotope Stage 6 (MIS 6; 186 ± 30 – 113 ± 10 ka), characterized by thick lacustrine deposits, rock benches, and ice-polished bedrock along the trunk valleys. We provide the first account of the numerical dating for the much-awaited timing of the oldest Chandra glacial stage (Local Last Glacial Maxima; LLGM) in the region (Owen et al., 1996, 1997, 2001). The LLGM in the CBB is much older than previously thought, consistent with some north-western Himalayan glacial records (Owen et al., 2006; Dortch et al., 2010; Hedrick et al., 2011; Orr et al., 2017, 2018). The Batal glacial stage occurred during the early MIS 3 and is dated from 47 ± 2 to 41 ± 2 ka, represented by the thick lacustrine deposits and impressive terraces. The Dali glacial stage occurred during the Global Last Glacial Maxima (GLGM), characterized by a series of latero-frontal recession moraines, and is dated from 33 ± 3 to 13 ± 1 ka. The Mayar advance is characterized by confined tributary valley glaciers, possibly linked to the LIA advance reported in the Kulti valley (Saha et al., 2019). The equilibrium line altitude (ELA) rose by ∼486 m from the Chandra stage to the present day. Reconstructed ELA altitudes and glacial landforms demonstrate that the glaciations have become progressively less extensive through time for this part of the western Himalayas.

There are mainly three kinds of methods for the prediction of severe typhoon formation, which are the numerical-based methods, the statistical-based methods, and the machine learning-based methods. However, existing methods do not consider the unbalance between the number of ordinary typhoon samples and severe typhoon samples, which makes the accuracies of existing methods in the prediction of severe typhoons much lower than that of ordinary typhoons. Methods In this paper, we propose an unbalanced severe typhoon formation prediction (USFP) framework based on transfer learning. We first propose a severe typhoon pre-learning model which is used to learn prior knowledge from a constructed balanced dataset. Then, we propose an unbalanced severe typhoon re-learning model which utilizes the prior knowledge learning from the pre-learning model.

Supervised machine learning approaches have the potential to radically improve segmentation accuracy but are hampered by a lack of fully annotated 3D data. In this work, we first establish a novel mouse line expressing near-infrared nuclear reporter H2B-miRFP720. H2B-miRFP720 is the longest wavelength nuclear reporter in mice and can be imaged simultaneously with other reporters with minimal overlap. We then generate a dataset, which we call BlastoSPIM, of 3D microscopy images of H2B-miRFP720-expressing embryos with ground truth for nuclear instance segmentation. Using BlastoSPIM, we benchmark the performance of five convolutional neural networks and identify Stardist-3D as the most accurate instance segmentation method across preimplantation development. Stardist-3D, trained on BlastoSPIM, performs robustly up to the end of preimplantation development (&gt; 100 nuclei) and enables studies of fate patterning in the late blastocyst.

Firstly, asphalt is a temperature-sensitive material, and many of its characteristics are related to temperature. Secondly, because of the increasing construction height of the dam, the pressure on the asphalt concrete core wall is also great. Finally, for the purpose of resource utilization, it is necessary to verify whether the reclaimed asphalt concrete can be used in dam construction. Therefore, it is necessary to study the stress and deformation characteristics of recycled asphalt concrete under different temperatures and confining pressures. In this study, three groups of triaxial tests of reclaimed asphalt concrete were carried out for the first time in a new temperature-controlled room. Duncan Zhang’s E-v model was used to fit the test results. The results show that the stress–strain curves of reclaimed asphalt concrete show softening characteristics at low temperatures and low confining pressure. It evolves to a hardening type with the increase in temperature and confining pressure. The bulk curve is first contracts but is followed by dilatancy. The dilatancy characteristics become more obvious at low temperatures and low confining pressure. With the increase in temperature and confining pressure, the dilatancy characteristics will weaken. Duncan Zhang’s E-v model has a good fitting effect on the stress–strain relationship but a poor fitting effect on the volumetric curve.

In this study, direct shear tests are conducted to investigate the shear behaviour of soil and soil–structure interface in the practical temperature range of energy geostructures (i.e., 8–45 °C). The interface in this study is formed of kaolin in contact with concrete specimens with different roughness. Tests are performed on normally consolidated and overconsolidated interfaces following the unloading/reloading paths to better understand the impact of thermal strain on the interface behaviour. The volumetric response of the interface is observed to be highly influenced by the thermal strains experienced during heating/cooling. The soil stress level and the most recent soil stress history are identified as the primary determinants of thermally induced changes in interface shear strength. For normally consolidated interfaces, the temperature increase led to higher adhesion and slightly lower friction angle, whereas higher adhesion and identical friction angles were found for tests conducted on cooled specimens. Temperature does not seem to affect the shear strength of overconsolidated interfaces.

However, whether and how GhPYL9-5D and GhPYR1-3A, the homologues of Arabidopsis PYL9 and PYR1 in cotton, function in responding to ABA and abiotic stresses are still unclear. Results GhPYL9-5D and GhPYR1-3A were targeted to the cytoplasm and nucleus. Overexpression of GhPYL9-5D and GhPYR1-3A in Arabidopsis wild type and sextuple mutant pyr1pyl1pyl2pyl4pyl5pyl8 plants resulted in ABA hypersensitivity in terms of seed germination, root growth and stomatal closure, as well as seedling tolerance to water deficit, salt and osmotic stress. Moreover, the VIGS (Virus-induced gene silencing) cotton plants, in which GhPYL9-5D or GhPYR1-3A were knocked down, showed clearly reduced tolerance to polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG)-induced drought, salinity and osmotic stresses compared with the controls. Additionally, transcriptomic data revealed that GhPYL9-5D was highly expressed in the root, and GhPYR1-3A was strongly expressed in the fiber and stem. GhPYL9-5D , GhPYR1-3A and their homologs in cotton were highly expressed after treatment with PEG or NaCl, and the two genes were co-expressed with redox signaling components, transcription factors and auxin signal components. These results suggest that GhPYL9-5D and GhPYR1-3A may serve important roles through interplaying with hormone and other signaling components in cotton adaptation to salt or osmotic stress. Conclusions GhPYL9-5D and GhPYR1-3A positively regulate ABA-mediated seed germination, primary root growth and stomatal closure, as well as tolerance to drought, salt and osmotic stresses likely through affecting the expression of multiple downstream stress-associated genes in Arabidopsis and cotton.",en,2,8480410.789364923,19,"{'Biology': 79511, 'Art': 33646, 'Medicine': 23561, 'History': 22144, 'Psychology': 12661, 'Philosophy': 30605, 'Sociology': 20865, 'Environmental science': 33847, 'Computer science': 41349, 'Political science': 17264, 'Physics': 8746, 'Mathematics': 11146, 'Geography': 10215, 'Chemistry': 4691, 'Economics': 4739, 'Business': 11634, 'Engineering': 6416, 'Materials science': 2409, 'Geology': 833}",1.0

In this work, Gl cottonseed kernels were used with additional cottonseed oil to produce novel peanut butter-like products. Kernels roasted at two temperatures (140 or 150 °C) for a given time (15 or 30 min) were first ground with different ratios of cottonseed oil and two other ingredients (i.e., salt and sugar) with a food blender, and then passed through a meat grinder with a 4-mm-hole grinding plate. Per the preliminary result, the butter-like products with Gl kernels roasted at 150 °C were subject to further structural and textural evaluation. The color of the two butter-like products was comparable to a commercial peanut butter, but the formers’ textural properties were significantly different (p ≤ 0.05) from the latter. Morphologic examination by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and cryo-SEM revealed that the butter product with a longer (30 min) roasting time possessed a smoother surface than the products with a shorter (15 min) roasting time. Oil stability test showed no substantial oil separation (<3%) from the butter products over 7 weeks at ambient temperature (22 °C).

A combination of KBP, MCO and CSM may result in higher quality plan output with potential to improve all prospective clinical plans. This study assesses the benefit of MCO, using CSM, and its application in the evolution of the KBP model.A retrospective Dose Volume Histogram (DVH) parameter review was undertaken for 40 intact prostate radiotherapy cases.

Emphasis was on (i) developing a reliable methodology for screening maize for tolerance to drought stress (DS), heat stress (HS), and combined drought and heat stress (CDHS) using key secondary traits and grain yield, (ii) use of appropriate breeding techniques for tailoring maize for tolerance to DS, HS and CDHS, (iii) exploring diverse sources of germplasm for genetic enhancement of maize, (iv) extensive multilocational evaluation to identify genotypes with stable performance under the stresses, and (v) application of genomic tools to accelerate genetic gains in maize breeding at IITA. At IITA, the performance of maize hybrids under stresses of DS, HS and CDHS have been improved using conventional breeding techniques/procedures. These techniques/ procedures have led to accelerated genetic gains in yield that were 26–49% higher than the best commercial hybrid checks under CDHS and DS. Additive gene action has been consistently found to be more important than the non-additive among early maize under DS and CDHS while both the additive and non-additive have been reported to be important for the extra-early maize. The most reliable secondary traits for selecting for improved grain yield under the stresses include anthesis-silking interval, ears per plant, and plant and ear aspects. Several early and extra-early landraces have been identified as potential sources of tolerance to DS, HS, and CDHS. Several quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with grain yield and key secondary traits have been identified via genome-wide association studies in landraces and inbred lines. Those desirable QTLs, upon validation, could be invaluable for genomics-enabled breeding.",en,2,0.0,0,{},0.0

Neuroradiologists widely use Magnetic Resonance Imaging as a golden standard non-invasive imaging method for diagnosing Glioma grades. Brain tumor diagnosis based on radiology images is tedious and highly subjective to intra and inter-observer variability; it adversely affects therapeutic planning. Better medical treatment can be provided relating to similar past cases if relevant images are retrieved from an extensive medical image database. Content-Based Image Retrieval systems are potent image tools for dealing with such massive datasets.

Reconciling Sun-as-a-star spectroscopy and high-spatial resolution solar observations in the context of the solar-stellar connectionStellar flares cannot be spatially resolved, which complicates ascertaining the physical processes behind particular spectral signatures. Due to their proximity to Earth, solar flares can serve as a stepping stone for understanding their stellar counterparts, especially when using a Sun-as-a-star instrument and in combination with spatially resolved observations. We aim to understand the disk-integrated spectral behaviors of a confined X2.2 flare and its eruptive X9.3 successor, which had energies of $2.2 $ erg and $9.3 $ erg, respectively, as measured by Sun-as-a-star observations with the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher for the Northern hemisphere (HARPS-N). The behavior of multiple photospheric ( Mg I at 5173 Fe I at 6173 and Mn I at 4031 and chromospheric ( and He I \,D$_3$) spectral lines were investigated by means of activity indices and contrast profiles. A number of different photospheric lines were also investigated by means of equivalent widths, and radial velocity measures, which were then related to physical processes directly observed in high-resolution observations made with the Swedish 1-meter Solar Telescope (SST) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Our findings suggest a relationship between the evolving shapes of contrast profile time and the flare locations, which assists in constraining flare locations in disk-integrated observations. In addition, an upward bias was found in flare statistics based on activity indices derived from the lines. In this case, much smaller flares cause a similar increase in the activity index as that produced by larger flares. activity indices do not show this bias and are therefore less susceptible to activity jitter. Sodium line profiles show a strongly asymmetric response during flare activity, which is best captured with a newly defined asymmetrical sodium activity index. A strong flare response was detected in Mn I line profiles, which is unexpected and calls for further exploration.

PSR J1023+0038 is the first millisecond pulsar that was ever observed as an optical and UV pulsar. So far, it is the only optical transitional millisecond pulsar. The rotation- and accretion-powered emission mechanisms hardly individually explain the observed characteristics of optical pulsations. A synergistic model, combining these standard emission processes, was proposed to explain the origin of the X-ray/UV/optical pulsations. Aims. We study the phase lag between the pulses in the optical and X-ray bands to gain insight into the physical mechanisms that cause it. Methods. We performed a detailed timing analysis of simultaneous or quasi-simultaneous observations in the X-ray band, acquired with the XMM-Newton and NICER satellites, and in the optical band, with the fast photometers SiFAP2 (mounted at the 3.6 m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo) and Aqueye+ (mounted at the 1.8 m Copernicus Telescope). We estimated the time lag of the optical pulsation with respect to that in the X-rays by modeling the folded pulse profiles with two harmonic components. Results. Optical pulses lag the X-ray pulses by ∼150 μs in observations acquired with instruments (NICER and Aqueye+) whose absolute timing uncertainty is much smaller than the measured lag. We also show that the phase lag between optical and X-ray pulsations lies in a limited range of values, δϕ ∈ (0 − 0.15), which is maintained over timescales of about five years. This indicates that both pulsations originate from the same region, and it supports the hypothesis of a common emission mechanism. Our results are interpreted in the shock-driven mini pulsar nebula scenario. This scenario suggests that optical and X-ray pulses are produced by synchrotron emission from the shock that formed within a few light cylinder radii away (∼100 km) from the pulsar, where its striped wind encounters the accretion disk inflow.",en,2,0.0,0,{},0.0

We leverage the ability of NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) to render novel RGB perspectives of a scene. We only require as input the camera image whose pose is being estimated, an estimate of the camera pose we want to monitor, and a NeRF model containing the scene pictured by the camera. We can then predict if the pose estimate is within a desired distance from the ground truth and justify our prediction with a level of confidence. VERF-Light does this by rendering a viewpoint with NeRF at the estimated pose and estimating its relative offset to the sensor image up to scale. Since scene scale is unknown, the approach renders another auxiliary image and reasons over the consistency of the optical flows across the three images. VERF-PnP takes a different approach by rendering a stereo pair of images with NeRF and utilizing the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm. We evaluate both methods on the LLFF dataset, on data from a Unitree A1 quadruped robot, and on data collected from Blue Origin's sub-orbital New Shepard rocket to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pose monitoring method across a range of scene scales.

Within this framework, plant density can play a central role. The aim of this two-year study was to investigate how planting density can induce variations in plant growth and yield performances in an alpine mountain strawberry cultivation (Martell Valley, South Tyrol, Italy), and consequently quantify the farm profit. Frigo strawberry plants cv. Elsanta were planted in soil on raised beds and subjected to five different planting density levels (30,000 and 45,000 as large spacing; 60,000 as middle spacing; 90,000 and 100,000 plants ha−1 as narrow spacing, corresponding to a plant spacing of 28, 19, 14, 9, and 8.5 cm, respectively). Our findings indicate that the aboveground biomass in plants subjected to low planting density was significantly increased by +50% (end of first year) and even doubled in the second year in comparison with plants in high planting density. Those results were related to higher leaf photosynthetic rate (+12%), and the number of crowns and flower trusses per plant (+40% both) (p &lt; 0.05). The low yield (about 300 g plant−1) observed in the high planting density regime was attributable to smaller fruit size during the first cropping year and to both a reduced number of flowers per plant and fruit size during the second year (p &lt; 0.05). Although the highest yield (more than 400 g plant−1) was obtained with wide plant spacing, the greatest yield per hectare was achieved with high planting densities (28 t ha−1 in comparison with 17 t ha−1 with low plant density level). However, the farm profit must take into account the costs (especially related to the plant material and harvesting costs) that are higher under the high planting density compared with the other density regimes. Indeed, the maximum farm profit was reached with a density of 45,000 plants ha−1 which corresponded to EUR 22,579 ha−1 (over 2 years). Regarding fruit quality, fruits coming from the low plant density level showed a significantly higher color index (+15% more red color) than fruits from high plant density (p &lt; 0.05).

A linear stability analysis shows that the LH polarised waves are anti-Sunward propagating Alfv\'en/ion cyclotron (A/IC) waves primarily driven by a proton cyclotron instability in the proton core population, and the RH polarised waves are anti-Sunward propagating fast magnetosonic/whistler (FM/W) waves driven by a firehose-like instability in the secondary alpha beam population. The abrupt transition from LH to RH is caused by a drop in the proton core temperature anisotropy.

The region is prone to moderate and low-magnitude earthquakes within the depth range of ∼ 3 to ∼ 24 km. We observed that the earthquakes in this region are associated with seismically active brittle and ductile crustal layers. To understand the dynamics of the earthquake generation process, we applied an integrated geological and geomorphological approach, supplemented by subsurface geophysical (magnetotelluric) studies. Additionally, the active surface deformation has been measured using the PSInSAR and GLA techniques. Based on the stream offset and geomorphic landform development pattern several NW-SE and NE-SW oriented strike-slip faults have been identified. The PSI-derived displacement analysis reveals that the area is deforming at the rate of ± 5 mm/yr. Furthermore, subsurface crustal heterogeneity with increasing depth has been identified using the magnetotelluric technique, which is reflected in the form of basaltic lava flows, plutonic emplacement within the granitic basement, and the presence of semi-crystallized magmatic bodies below the brittle-ductile level. Additionally, we proposed a model to depict the plutonic emplacement within the highly fractured/faulted granitic basement and their relationship to the earthquake generation process. Our model shows that crustal heterogeneity and the migration of hydrothermal fluid from the semi-crystallized magmatic body along the active fault cause earthquake nucleation processes within the brittle and ductile layers. We concluded that the upwelling magmatic fluid above the brittle-ductile transition (BDT) acted as a lubricant for the nucleation and triggering of the earthquake along the active faults. Similarly, the fractured ductile crust is weakened by fluid migration, which causes high fluid pressure in the ductile crust thereby decreasing the confining pressure and endorsing the velocity weakening in the aseismic layer, responsible for the shear instability that causes deep crustal earthquakes. More specifically, the lithological heterogeneity at brittle and ductile regimes is an important factor for the earthquake nucleation process in this part of the Indian plate.",en,2,7682124.741370013,19,"{'Geology': 156841, 'Engineering': 43641, 'Environmental science': 92240, 'Business': 13521, 'Mathematics': 11450, 'Sociology': 41487, 'Physics': 7560, 'Geography': 27337, 'Economics': 8660, 'Philosophy': 18261, 'History': 41201, 'Psychology': 11322, 'Computer science': 9069, 'Art': 13605, 'Political science': 16399, 'Materials science': 2685, 'Biology': 779, 'Medicine': 1553, 'Chemistry': 1497}",1.0

Incorporation of lightweight B206 alloy in automotive suspension components may significantly reduce overall vehicle weight and increase the vehicle’s fuel efficiency. However, one of the major factors inhibiting the use of B206 is its high susceptibility to hot tearing during casting. Hot tearing is a complex phenomenon attributed to alloy solidification, microstructure and stress/strain development within a casting. Numerous methods (e.g. preheating of mold, grain refinement, elimination of sharp corners in a component) help to reduce the occurrence of hot tears in castings, but the underlying mechanisms responsible for hot tearing remain ambiguous. This research aims to advance the understanding of the mechanisms responsible for hot tearing in B206 Al alloy. In this research, the conditions associated with the formation of hot tears in B206 were investigated via ex situ and in situ methods. Titanium was added in three levels (i.e. unrefined, 0.02 and 0.05 wt%) to investigate the effect of grain refinement on hot tearing. Ex situ neutron diffraction strain mapping was carried out on the three B206 castings to determine casting strain and stress. Further, in situ techniques were used to establish the onset temperature and solid fraction of hot tearing in B206 and to improve the understanding of microstructure development in B206. The results indicate that titanium additions had a significant impact on the hot tearing susceptibility of B206, by effectively reducing grain size and transforming grain morphology from coarse dendrites to fine globular grains. Further, thermal analysis suggested that grain refinement delayed the onset of dendrite coherency in B206 and therefore enhanced the duration of bulk liquid metal feeding for the refined casting conditions. As a result, the interactive effects of such factors resulted in a more uniform distribution of strain, and subsequent higher resistance to hot tearing for the grain refined castings. Finally, in situ analysis determined the onset solid fraction of hot tearing in B206 and provided an understanding of the role of microstructure on hot tearing in B206.",en,2,6986544.318057382,19,"{'Materials science': 206856, 'Chemistry': 43128, 'Engineering': 29081, 'Business': 12584, 'Sociology': 41463, 'Art': 17140, 'Political science': 25619, 'History': 43119, 'Computer science': 29409, 'Environmental science': 30586, 'Geography': 21140, 'Economics': 5357, 'Geology': 2605, 'Mathematics': 5928, 'Psychology': 8735, 'Philosophy': 17423, 'Medicine': 1512, 'Physics': 3400, 'Biology': 247}",1.0

This high carbon storage capacity makes them a key potential mitigation strategy for increased carbon emissions induced by global climate warming. In high-carbon storage systems like peatlands, soil faunal communities are responsible for secondary decomposition of organic matter and nutrient cycling, which suggests they play an important role in the carbon cycle. Experiments have shown that warming can affect plant and microbial communities in ways that potentially shift peatlands from carbon sinks to sources. Although previous studies have found variable effects of climate change manipulations on soil communities, warming is expected to affect soil community composition mainly through reductions in moisture content, whereas elevated CO 2 atmospheric concentrations are expected to only indirectly and weakly do so. In this study we used a large-scale peatland field-based experiment to test how soil microarthropod (oribatid and mesostigmatid mite, and collembolan species abundance, richness and community composition) respond to a range of experimental warming temperatures (between 0°C and +9°C) crossed with elevated CO 2 conditions over 4 years in the Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) experiment. Here we found that warming significantly decreased surface peat moisture, which in turn decreased species microarthropod richness and abundance. Specifically, oribatid and mesostigmatid mite, collembolan, and overall microarthropod richness significantly decreased under lower moisture levels. Also, the abundance of microarthropods increased under higher moisture levels. Neither warming nor elevated [CO 2 ] affected microarthropods when analysed together or separate, except for the richness of mesostigmatids that significantly increased under warming. At the community level, communities varied significantly over time (except collembolans), and moisture was an important driver explaining community species composition. While we expect that the cumulative and interactive effects of the SPRUCE experimental treatments on soil faunal biodiversity will continue to emerge, our results already suggest effects are becoming more observable over time. Taken together, the changes belowground indicate potential changes on carbon and nitrogen cycles, as microarthropods are important players of soil food webs.",en,2,0.0,0,{},0.0

Developing effective ammonia oxidation wastewater treatment strategies is an ideal approach for facilitating APW treatment. Compared with traditional nitrification strategies, the partial nitrification process is more eco-friendly, less energy-intensive, and less excess sludge. The primary limiting factor of the partial nitrification process is increasing ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) while decreasing nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB). In this study, an efficient AOB microbiota (named AF2) was obtained via enrichment of an aerobic activated sludge (AS0) collected from a pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plant. After a 52-day enrichment of AS0 in 250 mL flasks, the microbiota AE1 with 69.18% Nitrosomonas microorganisms was obtained. Subsequent scaled-up cultivation in a 10 L fermenter led to the AF2 microbiota with 59.22% Nitrosomonas. Low concentration of free ammonia (FA, < 42.01 mg L-1) had a negligible effect on the activity of AF2, and the nitrite-nitrogen accumulation rate (NAR) of AF2 was 98% when FA concentration was 42.01 mg L-1.

This study identifies; (i) aquifer promising zones (ii) aquifer protective capacity through geophysical investigation and suggests (iii) improving aquifer recovery management strategy as the top three targets for groundwater development. An electric resistivity technique was applied to acquire a total of sixty (60) vertical electrical sounding points with Schlumberger arrays. The study indicates the resistivity layer of the aquifer unit ranges from 21 to 294 Ωm, while the aquifer layer thickness values spread from 8 to 59 m and the overburden thickness overlays the aquifer unit extends from 3 to 20 m. The deeper aquifer zones were encountered between 30 and 59 m, which could be suitable for groundwater development, and the shallow aquifer occurs between 8 and 14 m, which is not encouraging for groundwater development and may be susceptible to surface contaminations. However, for water security and sustainability, multiple boreholes should be sited at the delineated aquifer promising zone where the aquifer is fractured and occurs within a depth of 30 m and above.

A scoping review to April 2022 of the influence of setting on what was implemented as IONM and how it influenced postoperative outcomes was performed for studies that compared IONM to no IONM cohorts. IONM complexity was assessed with the iCAT_SR tool. Causal graphs were used to represent this complexity. IONM implementation depended on the surgical procedure, institution and/or surgeon. “How” IONM influenced neurologic outcomes was attributed to surgeon or institutional experience with the surgical procedure, surgeon or institutional experience with IONM, co-interventions in addition to IONM, models of IONM service delivery and individual characteristics of the IONM provider. Indirect effects of IONM mediated by extent of tumor resection, surgical approach, changes in operative procedure, shorter operative time, and duration of aneurysm clipping were also described. There were no quantitative estimates of the relative contribution of these indirect effects to total IONM effects on outcomes. IONM is a complex intervention whose evaluation is more challenging than that of a simple intervention. Its implementation and largely indirect effects depend on specific settings that are usefully represented in causal graphs. IONM evaluation as a complex intervention aided by causal graphs and multivariable analysis could provide a valuable framework for future study design and assessments of IONM effectiveness in different settings.",en,2,0.0,0,{},0.0

The operation of tokamaks at high energy and plasma current requires the use of a mitigation system to limit such detrimental effects. Mitigation techniques rely mainly on the injection of a large amount of impurities to radiate the majority of the thermal and magnetic energies. Heat loads and electro-magnetic (EM) forces as well as their toroidal asymmetries can be greatly reduced by such measures. In this paper, a theory is lined out to explain the reduction of the global vertical force based on large toroidal halo currents that keep the current centroid stationary in the midplane. As a consequence, the vertical current moment, which is linked to the EM-force, is reduced. The theory is backed up by experimental observations in shattered pellet injection mitigated vertical displacement event experiments in ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) and JET as well as by 2D simulations with the extended MHD code JOREK. Scans in the boundary heat flux are carried out to estimate the correct scrape-off layer temperature and the influence of the fraction of conducted energy. Finally, predictive simulations for ITER confirm the reduction of the vertical force by the injection of impurities.",en,2,0.0,0,{},0.0

It is found that the coherent convective cells (sharing similar features to quasi-coherent mode in experiment) on both sides of the O-point boundary are accumulated during the island formation. The phase entrainment of the convective cells on the turbulence both in the inner and the outer regions of the magnetic island sets up a nonlocal phase coupling channel and leads to a fast spreading of the outer turbulence into the magnetic island by conquering the flow shear at the O-point boundary. This nonlocal coupling mechanism of turbulence spreading is analogous to a turbulence version of the well-known enhanced diffusion of passive scalars in laminar convective flows of neutral fluid system.,en,2,0.0,1,{'Physics': 11464},0.0

This work aims to analyze the influence that of Sn has on the mechanical properties and antibacterial response of α−β ternary Ti–13Ta–xSn (x:3, 6, 9, and 12 at.%) alloy foams. The Ti-based alloys were designed considering three aspects; (i) final microstructure, (ii) alloying element types, and (iii) thermodynamics while using MAAT and ThermoCalc software. The alloys were obtained by mechanical alloying, with used milling times being 30 h for Ti–13Ta–3Sn, 10 h for Ti–13Ta–6Sn, 10 h for Ti–13Ta–9Sn, and 15 h for Ti–13Ta–12Sn. The foams were obtained using NaCl as the space holder (50 v/v% porosity) and consolidated by a hot pressing method at 780 °C for 30 min, applying a load of 40 MPa. Both the Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 strain and Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 strain were used to evaluate the antibacterial responses of Ti-based alloy foams. The Ti-based alloy foams were composed mostly by a mix of α and β-phases. The metallic foams exhibited relative homogeneous pore distribution with a size between 100 and 450 μm and having an average porosity slightly higher than 50%. The samples showed elastic modulus values between 1 and 2 GPa, compressive yield strengths over 150 MPa, and microhardness over 450 HV.

While this framework has been exploited for regions with a high degree of symmetry, we take the first steps towards understanding general entangling regions, focusing on AdS 4 . Inspired by simple constructions achieved for the case of disks and the half-plane, we reformulate bit threads in terms of a magnetic-like field generated by a current flowing through the boundary of the entangling region. The construction is possible for these highly symmetric settings, leading us to a modified Biot-Savart law in curved space that fully characterizes the entanglement structure of the state. For general entangling regions, the prescription breaks down as the corresponding modular Hamiltonians become inherently nonlocal. We develop a formalism for general shape deformations and derive a flow equation that accounts for these effects as a systematic expansion. We solve this equation for a complete set of small deformations and show that the structure of the expansion explicitly codifies the expected nonlocalities. Our findings are consistent with numerical results existing in the literature, and shed light on the fundamental nature of quantum entanglement as a nonlocal phenomenon.",en,2,194438.64133208847,11,"{'Physics': 53490, 'Mathematics': 8413, 'Psychology': 3990, 'Materials science': 38, 'Engineering': 106, 'Environmental science': 93, 'Computer science': 33, 'Philosophy': 37, 'Political science': 19, 'History': 19, 'Economics': 37}",1.0

That pre-teen need to fit in still slinking around the edges. I remember self-consciousness awakening in me at that age, but if I think of being eleven, what inevitably arises first, still holding sway in me, is the church bells of the Episcopal school I attended in fifth and sixth grades. The bells rang before weekly chapel, a service unfamiliar to me, Baptist child that I was, and their sound comforted me, ringing out across the courtyard where I moved awkwardly, inarticulate in middle-school insecurities. They made music of the sky for a few minutes and sang of something else beyond the fenced-in world in which I moved each day. What I remember more viscerally than their ringing is the time I was assigned to set them going: another student and I are standing in a tiny room opposite the altar, the massive rope suspended from a bell so high its brass blends into the tower's shadows. I take a turn pulling on the rope with all my eleven-year-old might, my body briefly lifting off the floor. In the momentum, in that singular glory, I pull again and again, and the bell gains its swing and sings. From those years, it isn't an index of learning but a collage of things that return to me: beakers from a science fair project, the monkey bars on my first and very lonely day at that school or how I later sat with other girls in the bathroom, giggling over stolen notes. Not who liked whom, but the tornado gray tile, the stormcloud wall of the locked stall. And especially those church bells, still ringing somewhere inside me, down the arcades of my ribs and limbs. Though I lacked reflection for this then, what I was learning was inextricably bound to being-in-the-world, my whole self encountering in the sensible world, in things themselves, the visible and invisible, audible and silent, overt and intuitively sensed. Much of this learning was subterranean and not at all the world that I was being taught to inhabit. We sat still in desks and were taught things that did somehow accumulate into working knowledge of the world. In chapel, we sat [End Page 316] in pews and listened to the priest, just as I sat each Sunday listening to my father preach. Some of it stuck. The stories themselves, for one: Joseph in a dungeon interpreting a baker's and cup-bearer's dreams, for instance. The details surrounding me, too, like the blue-cushioned pews, the pearl-beaded purse of the woman who gave me a peppermint each week, the brass offering plate with its red velvet center, and a giant wall map in my Sunday school classroom. Imagine the stories we could tell through the catalogue of things that accumulate in early memories. But for so long, my sense of this was hidden in forests of intuition, and in the daylight of days, I was taught reverence for reason, formulas, ideas, and clear codes of conduct. These offered safe and acceptable pathways in which I eagerly walked, and yet my eyes kept alighting on horizons, drawn to their haunting elsewheres. Very real horizons, I might add: we lived in the country for several years, and we had a massive field behind our house, bordered on three sides by a line of trees. I was enamored of it, of what I sensed hinting through, hovering beyond. I daydreamed myself riding a horse straight through those high archways of bark, and into what great distance? I suspect the same that called to me when I later stood looking across an ocean expanse, or toward a mountain range, or off the back of a ferry. Out there, beyond me, and also, of course, into that frightening and fascinating interior vastness. Less than a decade after those bells, I remember sitting in an English classroom in Kimpel Hall and reading the...",en,2,27581793.88438842,19,"{'Art': 90719, 'Sociology': 151309, 'Philosophy': 107421, 'History': 188809, 'Political science': 82434, 'Economics': 81992, 'Environmental science': 161488, 'Geography': 130990, 'Computer science': 39692, 'Medicine': 11327, 'Psychology': 45984, 'Mathematics': 22371, 'Business': 47854, 'Chemistry': 12639, 'Engineering': 17425, 'Biology': 5745, 'Geology': 8566, 'Physics': 4991, 'Materials science': 3953}",1.0

To address the relevance of ethanol in the behavioral response of the larvae, we analyzed the function of ethanol in the context of olfactory associative behavior in Canton S and w 1118 larvae. The motivation of larvae to move toward or out of an ethanol-containing substrate depends on the ethanol concentration and the genotype. Ethanol in the substrate reduces the attraction to odorant cues in the environment. Relatively short repetitive exposures to ethanol, which are comparable in their duration to reinforcer representation in olfactory associative learning and memory paradigms, result in positive or negative association with the paired odorant or indifference to it. The outcome depends on the order in which the reinforcer is presented during training, the genotype and the presence of the reinforcer during the test. Independent of the order of odorant presentation during training, Canton S and w 1118 larvae do not form a positive or negative association with the odorant when ethanol is not present in the test context. When ethanol is present in the test, w 1118 larvae show aversion to an odorant paired with a naturally occurring ethanol concentration of 5%. Our results provide insights into the parameters influencing olfactory associative behaviors using ethanol as a reinforcer in Drosophila larvae and indicate that short exposures to ethanol might not uncover the positive rewarding properties of ethanol for developing larvae.",en,2,0.0,0,{},0.0

Deep neural networks (DNNs) are able to achieve cutting-edge 3D object detection and segmentation performance using LiDAR point clouds. LiDAR-enabled autonomous vehicles provide human perception by segmenting LiDAR point clouds into meaningful regions and providing semantic context to the AV user. However, the generation of point clouds to provide semantic segmentation in AVs is not reliable and secure, which may result in traffic accidents. We propose a novel adversarial attack against LiDAR point clouds in autonomous vehicles in this paper. We devised an exchange vanishing adversarial attack (EVAA) to deceive LiDAR point clouds by introducing targeted noise on specific objects (e.g., vehicles and driveways). On two autonomous driving datasets with 3D object annotations, NuScenes and PandaSet, we evaluate the performance of our proposed attack framework.

Water samples were collected from the springs for chemical analysis and bedrock (i.e., Austin Chalk) and local soil samples were taken for mineralogical and chemical analyses. The mean (±1σ) pH of the spring waters is 6.3 ± 0.68. The spring waters also exhibit low redox potentials (Eh = −100 ± 70 mV), high iron (Fe) concentrations (40 mg kg−1), elevated As concentrations (up to 105 μg kg−1), moderate total dissolve solids (TDS) values (780 mg kg−1 ≤ TDS ≤1380 mg kg−1), and a sulfurous odor. Arsenic concentrations are highest where the springs discharge, but subsequently decreases with flow beyond the spring orifices. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of samples of the Austin Chalk from the field site revealed that pyritization of planktonic and benthic foraminifera tests is a common feature of these aquifer rocks, and that the pyrite occurs largely as framboids. Electron microprobe analysis of the pyrite grains indicate that early diagenetic forms consist chiefly of Fe and sulfur (S) in nearly stoichiometric proportions (i.e., ∼45 and 50 wt % respectively, for Fe and S), whereas late diagenetic and/or weathered forms are largely Fe (∼60 wt %) with minimal S contents (∼0.1 wt%). Arsenic is distributed evenly in both phases (∼0.2 wt %) but is absent in the surrounding carbonate matrix. The spring water compositions along with the mineralogy of the aquifer rocks and the ochreous precipitates are consistent with the source of the elevated dissolved As concentrations being the result of oxidation and chemical weathering of As-bearing pyrite that occurs within the Austin Chalk and overlying soils/sediments as recharging meteoric water reacts with these materials. We employ a simple 1-D reactive transport model that supports As-bearing pyrite oxidation by O2(aq) in recharging meteoric waters, adsorption of mobilized As onto the resulting neo-formed Fe(III) oxides/oxyhydroxides, followed by reductive dissolution of the neo-formed Fe(III) oxides/oxyhydroxides and re-release of the adsorbed into the groundwater as the likely geochemical processes responsible for the elevated As concentrations measured in the studied springs.",en,2,0.0,0,{},0.0

Nevertheless, BPD is a heterogeneous condition, and not all people with BPD have severe dissociation. This study examined whether the relationship of BPD features with trauma and dissociation would remain significant after controlling for some general non-specific mental health distress. We also made the first attempt to explore which specific BPD features would be particularly associated with dissociation. Methods We analyzed survey data from a sample of community health service users in Hong Kong ( N = 376). Hierarchical multiple regression and data-driven network analysis were used. Results The lifetime prevalence of DSM-5 BPD was 16.0% in our sample. Of participants who met criteria for BPD, 43.3% scored above cutoff on the dissociation measures, thus possibly having clinically significant dissociative symptoms. BPD features were associated with adulthood trauma and psychoform dissociation even after controlling for age, depression and self-esteem. Network analysis showed that some BPD features – including impulsivity, identity disturbance and suicidal/self-mutilation behaviors – were particularly associated with dissociation; other BPD features such as interpersonal-related problems had relatively weak to no connection with dissociation. Conclusions Our results suggested that some particular BPD features might be dissociative in nature, although further longitudinal research is required. We argue that a trauma-informed perspective should be employed when working with clients presenting with BPD features despite these features being commonly stigmatized. Further research on the intervention needs of the people with BPD who suffer from high levels of dissociation is required.",en,2,0.0,1,{'Psychology': 8496},0.0

Exhumed blueschist-facies metasedimentary and volcanic rocks exposed on the Pelion peninsula (eastern Thessaly, Greece) represent one of the largest coherent exposures of subduction-complex rocks in the eastern Mediterranean and are key for understanding early Cenozoic Hellenic subduction processes. In this study, we present new detrital zircon and apatite U-Pb data to reconstruct the stratigraphic anatomy and provenance of these rocks and to understand their correlation with other Aegean (Cycladic) HP-LT rocks and the Pelagonian Zone of mainland Greece.Detailed new U-Pb zircon and apatite data show two distinct, coherent, and stratigraphically upright structural slices, with (1) the South Pelion slice consisting of Permian-Late Cretaceous strata overlying Carboniferous basement and (2) the North Pelion slice comprising Triassic-Late Cretaceous strata overlying Neoproterozoic basement. Both slices exhibit Late Cretaceous strata at the top of the section characterized by cosmopolitan detrital zircon (DZ) signatures.

This can result in a biased model when deployed, leading to a reduction in model performance. One risk is that, as the population changes, certain demographic groups will be under-served or otherwise disadvantaged by the model, even as they become more represented in the target population. The field of domain adaptation proposes techniques for a situation where label data for the target population does not exist, but some information about the target distribution does exist. In this paper we contribute to the domain adaptation literature by introducing domain-adaptive decision trees (DADT). We focus on decision trees given their growing popularity due to their interpretability and performance relative to other more complex models. With DADT we aim to improve the accuracy of models trained in a source domain (or training data) that differs from the target domain (or test data). We propose an in-processing step that adjusts the information gain split criterion with outside information corresponding to the distribution of the target population.

In the current study, we sought to characterize motor learning by determining changes in the coupling behaviour between the brain functional and structural connectomes on a short timescale. 39 older subjects (age: mean (SD) = 69.7 (4.7) years, men:women = 15:24) were trained on a visually guided sequential hand grip learning task. The brain structural and functional connectomes were constructed from diffusion-weighted MRI and resting-state functional MRI, respectively. The association of motor learning ability with changes in network topology of the brain functional connectome and changes in the correspondence between the brain structural and functional connectomes were assessed. Motor learning ability was related to decreased efficiency and increased modularity in the visual, somatomotor, and frontoparietal networks of the brain functional connectome. Between the brain structural and functional connectomes, reduced correspondence in the visual, ventral attention, and frontoparietal networks as well as the whole-brain network was related to motor learning ability. In addition, structure-function correspondence in the dorsal attention, ventral attention, and frontoparietal networks before motor learning was predictive of motor learning ability. These findings indicate that, in the view of brain connectome changes, short-term motor learning is represented by a detachment of the brain functional from the brain structural connectome. The structure-function uncoupling accompanied by the enhanced segregation into modular structures over the core functional networks involved in the learning process may suggest that facilitation of functional flexibility is associated with successful motor learning.",en,2,10582468.147583907,19,"{'Psychology': 61063, 'Engineering': 10217, 'Business': 23426, 'Art': 35770, 'Materials science': 6149, 'Political science': 30338, 'Sociology': 51558, 'Philosophy': 36492, 'History': 52052, 'Computer science': 31515, 'Environmental science': 43794, 'Physics': 1590, 'Economics': 7645, 'Mathematics': 5703, 'Geology': 2048, 'Geography': 24262, 'Medicine': 5904, 'Chemistry': 2809, 'Biology': 1701}",1.0

More than 80% of the autistic children were considered minimally verbal. Participants were assessed at three time points between the age of 2 and 8 years using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence–Fourth Edition as a measure of full-scale IQ and the Raven’s Colored Progressive Matrices as a measure of fluid reasoning abilities (Gf). The performance on two perceptual tests (Visual Search and Children Embedded Figures Test) and the frequency of early non-verbal behaviors served as predictors of later intellectual abilities. Early performance on perceptual tests measured at preschool age was positively related to later full-scale IQ in both autistic and neurotypical children. Furthermore, both early non-verbal behaviors and performance on perceptual tests measured at preschool age were associated with later Gf in the autistic group. In contrast, only the performance on Children Embedded Figures Test was associated with later Gf in the neurotypical group. Early perceptual abilities\and non-verbal behaviors may be indicators of general intelligence and Gf abilities. Lay Abstract At the time of diagnosis, parents of autistic children frequently wonder what the future holds for their children in terms of intellectual development. It remains however difficult to answer this question at such a young age. Indeed, while early precursors of intelligence are well known for children following a typical development, these precursors remain to be identified for autistic children. Some theoretical models of intelligence suggest that perceptual abilities or behaviors, as seen early in autistic cognitive development, could be early indicators of intelligence. However, research examining the relation between early perceptual predictors and autistic intelligence over time is needed. This article is the first to consider a variety of early perceptual abilities and behaviors as precursors/predictors of intelligence at school age in autistic children. We showed that better performance in perceptual tasks at preschool age predicted better intellectual abilities measured later in autistic children. Importantly, our sample of autistic children represented the whole spectrum, including children with few to no spoken words, who are an important proportion of autistic preschoolers. While early perceptual abilities and behaviors may not substitute for a formal intellectual assessment, our results support that these indices may help estimate later intellectual level in autistic children. Perceptual abilities have the advantage to be easy to observe at preschool age and seem to fit the cognitive style of autistic children. Assessment methods could probably gain from including and focusing more on the perceptual strengths of autistic children.",en,2,2633040.562651343,19,"{'Psychology': 14857, 'Business': 7669, 'Geography': 8831, 'Sociology': 16649, 'Mathematics': 8114, 'Political science': 6461, 'Biology': 740, 'Medicine': 1460, 'Computer science': 10993, 'Environmental science': 5222, 'Art': 6479, 'Philosophy': 7946, 'Materials science': 777, 'History': 13002, 'Chemistry': 551, 'Economics': 1584, 'Engineering': 564, 'Geology': 146, 'Physics': 57}",1.0
https://openalex.org/W4386366179,2023,"['History', ' Computer science']","Performance on the Blockchain: Zhang Huan and EchoXIn 2002, Chinese artist Zhang Huan crossed through New York’s streets wearing a bodysuit made of raw meat that shaped him with bulging contours and expanded his presence to into a humanoid, Hulk-like figure. By this time, it had been four years since Zhang left China. He had previously studied at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing, where he graduated in 1993. With personal identity and existential survival being his most pressing topics at the time, Zhang was able to exercise a radical, self-exploitative practice as a performance artist. In 2021, as part of a collaboration with the Taipei-based tech platform EchoX, Zhang created Celestial Burial of an Artist, a digital project that revisited Zhang’s meat-suit intervention My New York, his earlier work that now holds a firm position in the canon of performance art at the turn of the century. The two decades since Zhang’s original performance intervention have seen a trend towards score-based, multi-scale practices, depending less on artists’ physical presence, and departing from extreme physical actions. Zhang’s artistic trajectory relates to the conceptualization of the performative, too, even though his practice has since focused on the creation of object-based works.The artist’s return to China, in his words, marked a “point of no return,” separating his past productions from his future work. Zhang stopped performing his repertoire of past interventions because of a conscious desire “not to repeat himself,” as he considered his practice to have reached “the maximum results” with performance art by then. Reflecting this sentiment, Zhang’s 2021 return to My New York stayed away from the notion of reenactment. Celestial Burial of an Artist was conceptualized for online audiences to participate one-on-one in a performative interaction with Zhang’s avatar in a virtual game room. In reference to My New York, the artist’s avatar was rendered to be dressed in a golden meat suit. During period of several weeks in November 2021, audience members (or users) could engage with him in a game-room setting as a vulture-headed avatar, picking parts from the artist’s figure, with their mouse clicks simulating a hungry bird’s beak. This interaction was rewarded symbolically, with a small amount of the cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH). A few weeks later, participants were then able to transform the amount of ETH, generated through their interaction, into an NFT (non-fungible token). EchoX then minted a collection that is hosted on the NFT-platform OpenSea, displaying a total of five hundred and ten avatar-NFTs in metaverse meat suits, in a total of six different colors.NFTs are used mainly by media artists and seem to have very little to do with performance—or do they? This question arises since the boom period of NFTs has sparked conversations around collecting intangible art forms and their social and monetary value. Entering into public awareness from 2017 and experiencing a peak during the pandemic in 2020 and 2021, artists and art institutions have since shown great dedication to exploring the technology’s potential.1 Genre-defining figures of performance art such as Marina Abramović and Robert Wilson have entered the “global” NFT market to tokenize documents of their iconic, past performance works and sell them as NFTs, thereby solidifying the links between the live form and artists’ reliance on (sellable) documents.The conceptual grounds of NFTs are pegged out by an envisioned singularity, which, at first, seemingly (and only seemingly) recalls how the concept of the unique, non-exchangeable artist body is commonly addressed in performance studies. From a theoretical perspective, these approaches demand upholding the notion of performance art regarding the live event. This yearning for presence has been described by Amelia Jones as “the dilemma how performance cultures work. Precisely because it claims both to be ’art’ and to be ’live’ […], live and/or performance art presses together modes of being, meaning and value that have historically been considered incompatible.”2 To carve out the territories of Zhang’s project, it is first necessary to delve a bit further into crypto language. In short, an NFT is a non- interchangeable unit of data that is stored on a digital ledger called the blockchain. NFTs are recorded through blockchains: decentralized, distributed digital ledgers that build from records, called blocks.Blockchains function to track transaction records across many computers, creating a system in which no block in a chain can be altered retrospectively without altering subsequent blocks at the same time. In a chain, a token simply describes a sequence of related characters that may be associated with digital files such as those containing images, video, audio, or text. In theory, this immutability—the ability of the ledger to remain unaltered—leads to a permanent and indelible history of transactions, which has been praised as a specific quality of blockchain systems. The ways in which blockchains store information in encrypted form across peer-to-peer computer networks thus, from a technological perspective, make them useful as keepers of important records and proof of ownership. In a blockchain context, the specific asset characteristic of NFTs is their non-fungibility. They are deployed to track a given file as a specific asset. Designed to represent a unique claim of “thingness,” they introduce an artificial scarcity into the vast landscapes of digital data.Drawing parallels to performance art in an analog setting, owning an NFT can be compared to owning a unique photographic print of a performance signed by the artist, while multiple other individuals may simultaneously own identical unsigned prints. The value of an analog work of art, after all, relies on social consensus as much as physical reality, and the current consensus around art NFTs largely forms the same way. Countering early adopter prophecies of democratization and decentralization, the “social factor” in fact plays an equally important role in how artists can position themselves within the platform-settings of the crypto market. As China has officially banned non-state crypto currencies and trade in September 2021, Zhang’s project benefitted from the infrastructure and resources of a Taiwan-based tech company in order to reach an international audience and market, using the Ethereum chain and the platform OpenSea.The setting of Celestial Burial of an Artist resembles that of online games, defined by the use of avatars, a clear set of rules, and resulting in a quantifiable outcome.3 For their collaboration with Zhang Huan, EchoX built a simple-to-navigate digital “live-site” with limited but clear directives regarding how the artist and his audiences were supposed to interact. The performance/game was organized in three rounds that took place over a ten-day period. In order to be part of its social-technical casino, participants entered the gaming room one by one, as a vulture-head avatar, to mine pieces from the artist’s avatar. Blending in with its meta-environment, Celestial Burial avatar of Zhang referenced the character of a Celestial, inspired by fictional figures of the same name that appear in an iconic series of American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Visually, it can be best described as a voxelized version of a bulky statue made of gold ingots. In connection with the artist’s spiritual beliefs, the concept of Celestial Burial drew from the praxis of sky burial, in which a human corpse is exposed in mountainous areas to be eaten by scavenging animals, especially carrion birds.In Tibetan tradition, it is believed that this procedure serves the wish of the deceased to go to heaven. It is considered a bad omen if only a small number of birds come down to eat from the corpse, or even leave the body untouched. For a good rebirth, complete destruction of the remains is the practice’s goal. According to Ellen Pearlman, Zhang has called himself out as a Ju Shi, or “householder” Buddhist about eight years ago, “taking on the name ci ren or Sky Human. He has also studied Chán Buddhism, the Chinese precursor to Zen, with Master Sheng Yen in Queens, New York.”4 A bird had already featured in the setting of My New York. As Zhang moved through the busy metropolis, he released a single white dove to channel Christian symbolism of the peace-bringing dove as well as ancient Chinese fangsheng, animal-release rituals that are practiced until this day. While a bird served as a rather tangible metaphor in My New York and featured in Zhang’s performance Seeds of Hamburg, which he created back in 2002, Celestial Burial appropriated its symbolic presence as a tool to ignite an exchange between the artist’s avatar and its online audiences.In the performance, for thirty seconds, audiences could “pick” on the artist’s avatar to remove golden cubes from his figure. After this period, the game automatically ended, and participants were shown the amount of ETH that had been generated through the interaction. Presented in such framework, Celestial Burial of an Artist referenced the fact that games are experienced through the instance of playing. Therefore, each “play-through” constituted a key moment for a participant (as a player) to interact with Zhang Huan’s avatar. Moreover, the invitation to interact provided itself as the only opportunity to even enter the game’s experiential setting. An audience’s meeting with the delegated artist’s avatar, however, did not mark their status as co-authors whose presence would impact the situation and its potential ways of developing. Instead, a fully preprogrammed setting served to commodify an algorithmically shaped form of “interactivity.” The audiences’ (or players’) interactions with the work relied on preprogrammed terms. Playing a game is different from performing in a live (or even digital) setting—according to this logic, it was not the artist, but his abstracted golden avatar that audiences/players would be meeting and interacting with.EchoX introduced Celestial Burial of an Artist in slightly different terms, proclaiming that in the game, the artist waits for players to enter the burial ground for interaction. Each player can cut off [from] the artist’s body at will within a limited time. Players then can choose whether to mint the remainder [remains] of Zhang’s avatar into an NFT collectible.5This announcement suggested Zhang could actually “be present,” ready to encounter an online audience within the project’s temporal logic. Promoting an exclusive one-on-one experience with the artist within a limited time, Celestial Burial promoted itself through its claimed experiential ephemerality as well as envisioning a unique and special moment of encounter, two elements considered to be constitutive for performative happenings.6“Liveness” is a highly contested term in performance studies, often discussed regarding the ephemeral qualities of performance and the impossibility of its repe­tition. It is called upon to express the situated moment of encounter as a contingent, uncertain terrain ruled by chance and affect. Matthew Reason and Anja Mølle Lindelof convincingly argue that “the emphasis here is on a continual fabrication of the newness of the event and the fact that what is happening might go wrong: the dancer might fall, the equipment might fail and the actor might miss a line. Often this is hypothetical, a stress on the potential for difference rather than analysis of the impact of actual differences.”7 In fact, experimentation with visceral experience, bodily endurance, and pain had been core themes in Zhang’s early artistic practice which he explored through performance. Works including My America (Hard to Acclimatize), Pilgrimage—Wind and Water in New York, and My New York, probe the capacities and limits of corporeal (co-)presence, social norms and behavioral patterns, provoking judgment in the (public) social sphere.Focusing on this aspect of liveness, as a contingent but shared experience between artist and audiences, Thomas Berghuis, in his influential book on performance art in China, has called for the conditions of place in performance to be recognized as one of the core artistic expressions in contemporary art. Writing against the political and discursive marginalization of performance art in the Chinese political context, Berghuis recalls the need to “judge performance on the basis of human perception” and the “embodied sensibility of each individual participant in the performance.”8 Liveness, then, is within the relation a performance establishes between practitioner and audience. Understood in such relational manner, instead of an ontological liveness, performance proposes conditions of experiencing live. Through such unruliness, both parties within an encounter may allow themselves “to be caught out, to be affected, to be relocated and transported.”9In digital times, we see liveness expand into the virtual realm, where it may unfold to different degrees, as a co-performance of human and non-human entities. Yet stripping away the flawed human factor, Celestial Burial of an Artist states a particular case for an online performance. It stands apart from performances “transported” to the online realm through a live-stream that interactively addresses participants (users) in a virtual network. Unlike tech-based performances that would include possibilities for mutual interaction as a condition for its unfolding, the collaboration between Zhang and EchoX was not made as it was experienced and could not be experienced as it was made. Accordingly, in their attempt to reproduce the experiential factor, the project’s creative team came up with a particular kind of stopgap. In addition to the game-based online setting, performative offline interventions were organized across global metropolises. Demonstrating a well-staged synchronization of art, tech and popular culture, a chain of IRL (“in real life”) performance interventions took place in Shanghai, Qingdao, St. Petersburg, New York, and London. With the purpose of drawing attention to the project, volunteers strolled around in these cities wearing costumes printed with meat motifs. In truth, they performed dress-up parades through the streets that were thin in substance, more consonant with the folkloristic interventions of Renaissance fairs or Christmas markets than a philosophical expression of cryptofuturism. Their activity, shared all across social media, was geared towards the promotion of the crypto-performative, purposed to draw attention to Zhang’s artistic engagement with blockchain technology.A performance work enters Web3, as the “new,” decentralized and token-based internet is called, in a monetarized form, as crypto performance. The “crypto” prefix thereby manifests a technological vision that leans towards the prophetic. In a 1997 book titled The Sovereign Individual, authors William Rees-Mogg and James Dale Davidson predicted that the currency used in the information age would rely on “mathematical algorithms that have no physical existence.”10 Early claims such as theirs have shaped an imaginary promise to eliminate the traditional hierarchies of the economic system, and they also have been exploited in the context of the art market for the purpose of stimulating a gold rush inspired new era of sales. Zhang’s concept also bears reference to the aesthetics of online games that must, like science fiction, be regarded as the breeding ground for contemporary metaverse attempts and crypto-fantasies.To take part, participants first needed to register on the EchoX website. They were asked to provide basic contact information and to link their MetaMask wallet—a popular software cryptocurrency wallet that interacts with the Ethereum blockchain— to a newly created EchoX membership account. Optionally, they could register for a priority pass which required the sharing of a whole lot of data and the submission of “proof of following” screenshots, to document that they followed the Discord and Twitter accounts of both Zhang Huan and EchoX. The first five hundred participants who completed this form were granted “whitelist entry.” This registration procedure had, arguably, been designed to evoke a sense of competition, as if participants would try to squeeze into an overcrowded room in a gallery, but in the context of platform capitalism. While the sharing of one’s DeFi (decentralized finance) wallet in a crypto context does usually not require sharing one’s personal identity or data, this principle was disproved by this playful enforcement of social media networking. The formalism of such procedure framed the online event in terms that suggest an exclusive and restricted experience, revealing links to ritualism and its symbolic dimension of social gatherings.The virtual artist-audience engagement aimed at the creation of blockchain-based assets: sculptural fragmentary renderings of Zhang’s avatar minted into NFTs. This accords with how, as further development from Web 2.0 technologies, Web3 settings generally rely on the idea that users generate not only an information-based or interactive content, but also its economic and social structures. From December 15, 2021, players could mint their results of the game/performance as tokens in order to provide a verifiable and reliable claim of ownership over that asset. In technical terms, this process required (forced) each player to own a crypto wallet on MetaMask. Minting the NFT cost 0.025 ETH and an additional gas fee in order to compensate the computational effort required to execute an operation on the network. Participation was, therefore, asserted not through experience and the factor of a corresponding liveness, but attributed through an economic transaction. In other words, Celestial Burial of an Artist staged a virtual gathering to perform a meditated representation of monetary tectonics.Zhang’s revisiting of My New York in Celestial Burial of an Artist did not question the ability of the work to be alienable from the artist, a principle which is usually considered a fundamental prerequisite for any artwork, to be both collected and sold. The replacement of the performer with his avatar in the name of crypto instead demonstrates the self-identification of artistic labor with the type of capital extracting it. In this setting, the artist figure, in a self-proclaimed holistic manner, enacted his own commodification. Collaboratively, Zhang and EchoX put efforts to engage participation through a playful set-up and design, metaphorically and literally asking people to join the game. Their experimental engagement with NFTs demonstrates for the all-encompassing monetarization of the crypto art economy, as it plays through the process required for anyone who wishes to engage with it (as an investor) and mints an NFT (as their contract). What is relevant is that artists retain the copyright to their work, as owning the NFT does not equal ownership of the underlying digital asset. In fact, not a piece of Zhang’s avatar was sold, but what the artist offered to be minted was a collectible of the participants’ experience, exploiting the factor of social participation for crypto investment dynamics. In the game, the dimension of what would be understood as on-site engagement would no longer depend on geographic location. Instead, the priority of the bodily (a)live shifted to a code-based virtual space in which the avatars’ interaction relies on time-based coordinates. In such a setting, promises of blockchain-backed assetization allow for the permanent and traceable to impinge upon the ephemeral.In My New York, the meat costume covered only Zhang’s body, leaving his persona to be clearly identifiable. Addressing topics of identity and belonging, the New York performance, on the one hand, connected well to the larger discourse of questioning artistic “Chineseness” that many protagonists of China’s post-socialist art scene were busying themselves with in the 1990s and early 2000s. Further, as Mary Jane Jacob notes, Zhang’s approach holds aspects that make it stand apart from earlier examples of what she calls “Buddhism-inspired contemporary Chinese art made before the marketisation of China in the 1990s.”11 Developed alongside economic globalization, this points to how Zhang’s artistic trajectory was made possible by his strategic employment of his home region’s mercantile skills. Celestial Burial employs a similar approach to a China-globalist scale strategy. Through the support of EchoX, in terms of artistic creation as well as audience reach, the project navigated blockchain technology on an international level. In Zhang’s early performance work, the use of the word “my” is significant in this respect, as it already suggests an ownership, transforming “locations into a personal space,” as Christina Yu has argued.12After returning to live in China, Zhang has built his larger-than-life scale career—indeed, very effectively—by outsourcing concepts of the Western avant-gardes and bringing them to realization under the conditions of the Chinese labor market. His appearance as a faceless golden corpse avatar echoes how the public image of the artist has shifted from first being known in China for his radical approach to performance art to being known in the global commercial market as a tech-savvy materialist. The historic legacy of My New York served him as an anchor for market purposes, the participatory consolidation of which only enabled and further expanded its capitalization. In their recent essay collection Assetization: Turning Things into Assets in Technoscientific Capitalism, Kean Birch and Fabian Muniesa explain that no “thing” in this world is an asset per se, but almost anything can be turned into an asset. In light of the protean grabs of capitalism at play, they consider the questions of who “owns” something and “how they end up owning it and what that means for everyone else” as central to not only the study of assetization, but to the future of our societies at large.13 It is no wonder that Zhang’s digital double appears as symbolic gold-nugget avatar, pointing self-reflexively (and cynically) to the artist’s professional credentials which he acquired since the time of My New York.",en,2,0.0,0,{},0.0

However, surface defects, particularly wrinkling, occur in PP sheets during the inmold injection molding process. In this study, we analyzed the occurrence of wrinkles in decorative sheets by visualization experiments of the molding process as well as clarified the relationship between wrinkle depth and molding conditions, and measured the sheet deformation amount and shear force between the sheet and cavity surface. We found that the wrinkle generation phenomenon of PP sheets was caused by sheet deformation along the flow direction with sheet slippage on the cavity surface after passage of the flow front. The sheet deformation decreased as if according to a power-law distribution in line with increasing screw injection speed and it occurred over the front contact area for only a very short time immediately after the flow front passed. Based on these results, we proposed a sheet deformation model, where at the moment the flow front passed, the perpendicular force FZ and derived frictional force FS to the cavity surface did not rise enough to fix the sheet onto the cavity surface. Therefore, the sheet slipped on the mold surface and deformed with thermal expansion and deformation stress caused by flowing melts. After the FZ derived FS rose enough to fix the sheet onto the cavity surface, the sheet deformation stopped. These deformations in micro regions were integrated and the sheet wrinkle which had occurred was thought to be due to the redundant length of the sheet.",en,2,414206.41261808295,19,"{'Materials science': 66782, 'Engineering': 6332, 'Chemistry': 4993, 'Biology': 608, 'Economics': 545, 'Physics': 2306, 'Computer science': 1438, 'Mathematics': 907, 'Environmental science': 1172, 'Geography': 184, 'Sociology': 717, 'Art': 245, 'Political science': 319, 'History': 444, 'Psychology': 168, 'Geology': 112, 'Business': 241, 'Philosophy': 281, 'Medicine': 18}",1.0

Yet, they typically suffer from a stiffness-toughness compromise such that those that are soft and show adequate flexibility display limited actuation forces. This compromise can be partially addressed if hydrogels are formulated as double networks. However, their involved processing prevents controlled variations in the local composition. The composition of hydrogels can be varied down to the 100 µm length scale through 3D printing. A wide range of hydrogels can be 3D printed if formulated as microparticles. Yet, the resulting granular hydrogels are soft. They can be reinforced with a percolating hydrogel network, resulting in double network granular hydrogels (DNGHs) that, however, are rather brittle. Here, we introduce 3D printable metal-reinforced DNGHs (mrDNGHs) that combine three seemingly contradictory traits: stiffness, toughness, and processability. Our mrDNGHs can bear loads up to 3 MPa while displaying a fracture energy up to 12 MJ·m−3, a value that exceeds that of any of the previously 3D printed hydrogels at least 20-fold. We leverage the different degrees of swelling of the mrDNGHs to 3D print shape morphing structures.",en,2,26671733.880442195,19,"{'Materials science': 43654, 'Engineering': 36086, 'Computer science': 66255, 'Business': 56990, 'Environmental science': 117055, 'Sociology': 156606, 'History': 157265, 'Medicine': 8870, 'Art': 77039, 'Political science': 71451, 'Philosophy': 90274, 'Psychology': 42789, 'Mathematics': 16689, 'Geography': 90892, 'Economics': 25076, 'Geology': 8394, 'Chemistry': 7359, 'Biology': 5123, 'Physics': 3664}",1.0

Considerando que a lactação inibe o ciclo estral das fêmeas, estudos que relacionam a estação reprodutiva dos marsupiais com padrões ecológicos sem considerar se as fêmeas estão receptivas ao acasalamento podem resultar em interpretações equivocadas. Os objetivos deste estudo foram (1) determinar a duração do período no qual as fêmeas de Philander quica (Didelphimorphia, Didelphidae) estão receptivas ao acasalamento; e (2) a duração da estação reprodutiva considerando também o período de acasalamentos. Os dados de captura foram provenientes de três grades de amostragem em uma área de mata contínua na localidade do Garrafão, Parque Nacional da Serra dos Órgãos, e de 14 fragmentos de Mata Atlântica, todos no estado do Rio de Janeiro, Brasil. Para cada fêmea capturada com filhotes no marsúpio, a data da fecundação foi estimada somando-se o tempo de gestação das fêmeas (15 dias) à idade do filhote, estimada através de uma função não-linear de crescimento de P. quica. O período de acasalamento foi definido utilizando estatística circular. Houve 38 (11 com filhotes) e 113 (34 com filhotes) capturas de fêmeas na mata contínua e nos fragmentos, respectivamente. O período de acasalamentos foi sazonal em ambas as áreas, ocorrendo de junho a dezembro na mata contínua e de junho a novembro nos fragmentos. A estação reprodutiva foi praticamente contínua ao longo do ano (junho a abril), sendo que nos fragmentos nos meses de março e abril apenas foram registradas fêmeas lactantes. Portanto, considerar o período de acasalamento como uma informação, além da presença de fêmeas com filhotes ou lactantes, pode tornar mais claro ou possibilitar a reinterpretação de padrões ecológicos relacionados à estação reprodutiva. In ecological studies, the reproductive season of Neotropical marsupials is often defined based only on the presence of young in the marsupium and lactating females, without considering the phases of the estrous cycle, fertilization and gestation for the duration of the season. Considering that lactation inhibits the estrous cycle of females, studies that relate the reproductive season of marsupials to behavioral or space use patterns without considering whether females are receptive to mating may result in misinterpretations. The objectives of this study were (1) to determine the duration of the period in which female Philander quica (Didelphimorphia, Didelphidae) are receptive to mating; and (2) the duration of the breeding season, also considering the mating period. The capture data came from three sampling grids in a continuous forest area in Garrafão, Serra dos Órgãos National Park, and from 14 Atlantic Forest fragments, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. For each female captured with offspring in the pouch, the date of fertilization was estimated by adding the female’s gestation time (15 days) to the age of the offspring, using a non-linear function. The mating period was defined using circular statistics. There were 38 (11 with pups) and 113 (34 with pups) captures of females in the continuous forest and in fragments, respectively. The mating period was seasonal in both areas, occurring from June to December in the continuous forest and from June to November in the fragments. The breeding season was practically continuous throughout the year (June to April), and in the fragments in March and April only lactating females were recorded. Therefore, considering the mating period as information, in addition to the presence of females with offspring or lactating females, can clarify or allow the reinterpretation of behavioral patterns related to the breeding season.",en,2,0.0,0,{},0.0

Usually, they have few or no applications and are discarded, causing environmental pollution. To use them in a new way and reduce ecological pollution, we obtained the ash of yellow passion fruit peels by calcination. We characterized it using Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance (FTIR‐ATR), X‐ray fluorescence (XRF), X‐ray diffractometry (XRD), adsorption‐desorption of N 2 , scanning electron microscopy (SEM), basicity, and soluble alkalinity. It was observed that the ash was mainly composed of potassium (69%) in the form of carbonate, chloride, and sulfate, with a good surface area (11.23 m 2 g −1 ). The cupuaçu butter was also extracted from the cupuaçu seeds and characterized, showing low acidity, peroxide, saponification, and iodine indexes, in addition to presenting a lipid profile with 57% saturated fatty acid and 43% unsaturated fatty acid. Oleic and stearic acids were present in higher proportions. These results demonstrate that this butter can be a sustainable input in biodiesel production. Thus, the ash was used as a heterogeneous catalyst in the butter transesterification. The biodiesel synthesis was optimized, resulting in 97.8% butter conversion into biodiesel under the following conditions: reaction time of 2 h, 5 wt% of catalyst, 80 °C, and a methanol‐to‐oil molar ratio of 30. This work, therefore, shows that it is possible to obtain and utilize bioinputs, such as cupuaçu butter and passion fruit peel ash, to produce biodiesel through transesterification, and the use of waste materials (precisely passion fruit peels and cupuaçu seeds) makes this method a cost‐effective and environmentally friendly approach to biofuel production.",en,2,0.0,1,{'Chemistry': 3857},0.0

To address these problems, this paper proposes a CP-ABE (ciphertext policy attribute based encryption) cloud storage scheme with revocable attributes, which can ensure the security of attribute permissions, dynamic change of user attributes and complete protection of user privacy. The paper is based on a subset-covered attribute revocation technique, which generates a corresponding user tree for each user attribute to enable revocation of user attributes without updating the user key after revocation, reducing the corresponding computational overhead. Then, multiple attribute authorisation authorities are used to distribute and manage keys without introducing any other trusted authorities, protecting user privacy and avoiding security issues caused by a single attribute authorisation authority. Finally, a pre-decryption algorithm is designed to reduce the computational overhead of the user when decrypting. The security analysis yields that the scheme has ciphertext privacy and keyword privacy; the performance analysis finds that the scheme has low computation and communication overheads; the experimental analysis reflects that the scheme has low key storage overhead, ciphertext storage overhead and index storage overhead.",en,2,41561607.77999758,19,"{'Business': 98865, 'Computer science': 103224, 'Mathematics': 57511, 'Art': 97790, 'Political science': 86578, 'History': 195331, 'Medicine': 33003, 'Geography': 101087, 'Philosophy': 109487, 'Engineering': 26113, 'Environmental science': 152603, 'Psychology': 61137, 'Materials science': 14562, 'Sociology': 169889, 'Biology': 72096, 'Physics': 14763, 'Economics': 47992, 'Chemistry': 8730, 'Geology': 5496}",1.0

ST-CL acquires action-specific features by regarding the spatio-temporal continuity of motion tendency as the supervisory signal. To yield effective representations, ST-CL first designs some novel contrastive proxy tasks by providing different spatio-temporal observation scenes for the same 3D action and pulling them together in the embedding space. Second, three key components are devised in the action encoding to efficiently extract representations in contrastive tasks: (1) Information Representation introduces the awareness of joint type when analyzing motion dynamics. (2) Non-local GCN learns a data-driven graph topology structure and promotes a spatial message passing among long-range joints in each frame. (3) Multi-Scale TCN makes larger receptive fields for capturing richer longe-range temporal dynamics amomg adjacent frames. In ST-CL, these effective proxy tasks yield useful representations and efficient action encoding further enhances the representation capacity. As validated on four large-scale datasets, ST-CL is a strong baseline with high performance and efficiency for the contrastive learning study of the skeleton data.

In practice it is not always possible to sample functions at optimal nodes that give well-conditioned and quickly converging interpolatory quadrature rules at the same time. Therefore, we go beyond classical interpolatory quadrature by lowering the degree of the polynomial approximant and by applying auxiliary mapping functions that map the original quadrature nodes to more suitable fake nodes. More precisely, we investigate the combination of the Kosloff Tal-Ezer map and least-squares approximation (KTL) for numerical quadrature: a careful selection of the mapping parameter ensures stability of the scheme, a high accuracy of the approximation and, at the same time, an asymptotically optimal ratio between the degree of the polynomial and the spacing of the grid. We will investigate the properties of this KTL quadrature and focus on the symmetry of the quadrature weights, the limit relations for the mapping parameter, as well as the computation of the quadrature weights in the standard monomial and in the Chebyshev bases with help of a cosine transform. Numerical tests on equispaced nodes show that a static choice of the map’s parameter improve the results of the composite trapezoidal rule, while a dynamic approach achieves larger stability and faster convergence, even when the sampling nodes are perturbed. From a computational point of view the proposed method is practical and can be implemented in a simple and efficient way.",en,2,0.0,0,{},0.0

A government-funded healthcare payer perspective and a societal perspective were considered. Data collection was guided by the pathways of disease progression and care. Collection of costing data followed a bottom-up approach. The model was based on a Markov model used in a study in Thailand.Over the next 5 years, there will be 17 625 less hospitalizations (∼5.1% less than enalapril arm) and 7968 less cardiovascular-related deaths (∼7.0% less than enalapril arm). In 5 years, the total cost of treating patients with HFrEF with sacubitril/valsartan at current market coverage and annual growth conditions is ₱15.430 billion, which is ₱11.077 billion higher than fully treating with enalapril only. The total required additional investment with treatment of sacubitril/valsartan compared with the full enalapril arm are ₱407 million (at 30-day coverage), ₱800 million (at 60-day coverage), and ₱1.181 billion (at 90-day coverage). If hospitalizations costs alone are considered, only the 30-day coverage is cost-saving. If a societal perspective is considered, all options are cost-saving where at least ₱4.003 billion is saved by the economy.The initial investment required to treat patients with HFrEF with sacubitril/valsartan is high; nevertheless, the year-on-year cost deficit shrinks in favor of investing in sacubitril/valsartan treatment.",en,2,0.0,0,{},0.0

This study focuses on the Bjørnedal area where the distribution of bitumen has been mapped out. Bitumen staining clearly has a cross‐cutting relationship to stratigraphic units and can be shown to form distinct palaeo‐accumulations. Detailed petrographic studies show that bitumen occurs as late diagenetic phases in Middle to Late Jurassic sandstones, and is present both as both grain‐coating and pore‐filling phases. Geochemical analyses confirm that the bitumen is organic in composition and is composed largely of carbon and hydrogen. Both H/C ratios and bonds identified by FTIR behave as expected with increasing maturity measured using bitumen reflectance. Together, these results provide strong evidence that the material is pyrobitumen derived from the in situ thermal degradation of a liquid hydrocarbon precursor. On the basis of textures in transmitted and reflected light and quantitative bitumen reflectance distributions, two populations of pyrobitumen may be recognised in some samples. Two phases of Paleogene magmatism occurred in the Traill Ø region. The first late Paleocene – early Eocene phase was related to the opening of the northern North Atlantic in the earliest Eocene, and was experienced throughout East Greenland and the northwest European margin. The later magmatic phase was related to the gradual separation of the Jan Mayen microcontinent from East Greenland through the late Eocene – early Oligocene. A single pyrobitumen phase is recognised in accumulations only affected by the early magmatism, and a second phase is only observed in areas affected by both the early and later magmatism. This relationship is interpreted as evidence for a direct relationship between magmatic phases and bitumen generation. The presence of bitumen formed by the thermal degradation of liquid hydrocarbons during the later magmatic event suggests that a viable petroleum system remained active following the early magmatic event.",en,2,0.0,0,{},0.0

Oxygen isotopes of the recycled foraminifera and the content of sand grains, thought to be dropped from ice bergs, might have led to an interpretation of a too large and dramatic climate cooling.

The hydro-morphodynamic model is employed to predict water level, currents, waves, and seafloor evolution and provide the forcing term to the wave-induced liquefaction model. The model is validated using observations from instrumentation attached to two metal structures called quadpods moored at the 7.5 and 20 m bathymetric contours off the coast of Panama City, Florida. The field data include seafloor elevation relative to the instrumentation at the shallow quadpod, obtained from pencil beam sonar observations, and the maximum backscatter from the pulse coherent acoustic Doppler profiler. Observations determined that the seafloor elevated by 0.05 m during the first wave event and by 0.1–0.15 m during the second wave event. By comparing the water level observed by a nearby NOAA tide station, it is determined that the 0.05 m seafloor elevation increase during the first wave event is attributed to sediment accretion, whereas the 0.1–0.15 m elevation increase during the second wave event is attributed to settling of the quadpod into the sandy seafloor. The coupled model output is used to build maps of liquefaction degree and estimated failure depth. Results indicate the liquefaction occurred in areas with relative water depth (water depth/wavelength) smaller than 0.25, including the shallow quadpod location, which is consistent with the previous report that this quadpod sank during wave action.

This study investigates the interaction between scour at instream structures and bedform migration.

Two components constitute live-bed scour depth: the dynamic scour amplification Δd s caused by bedforms and the local flow-induced baseline scour depth d sNB . Results show that, for 2D structures, the baseline scour depth is negligible, while the live-bed scour is mainly caused by approaching bedforms. The dynamic scour amplification normalised by the approaching bedform height (Δd s /H b ) decreases with the decrease of upstream angle and varies between 0.5 and 2. For uniform 3D structures, the local flow could cause a considerable baseline scour depth, and Δd s /H b varies between 0.25 and 0.5 and decreases with the increase in the flow capacity to damp bedforms. For complex 3D structures, flow pressurisation beneath the pile-cap magnifies Δd s /H b to near 1. In general, Δd s /H b is inversely correlated with d s_NB /y 0 , where y 0 is flow depth.

Motor skills of children: unexpected, spontaneous movements of various parts of the body, and violations of the sequence of basic, habitual actions. Impaired psychomotor development in autism: There is a possibility that the distortion of the mirror neuron system may lead to a lack of speech function, which may cause a lack of ability to learn through imitation mechanisms. Identification, diagnosis of mental development, organization of help: Observations, conversations and medical documentation make it possible to draw a conclusion about the affective development of the child.

Both chronic stress and early life stress alter valence processing, the process of assigning value to sensory inputs and experiences (positive or negative), which determines subsequent behavior and is essential for emotional processing and ultimately survival. Stress disrupts valence processing in both humans and preclinical models, favoring negative valence processing and impairing positive valence processing. Valence assignment involves neural computations performed in emotional processing hubs, including the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and ventral hippocampus, which can be influenced by neuroendocrine mediators. Oscillations within and between these regions are critical for the neural computations necessary to perform valence processing functions. Major advances in the field have demonstrated a role for oscillatory states in valence processing under physiological conditions and emerging studies are exploring how these network states are altered under pathophysiological conditions and impacted by neuroendocrine factors. The current review highlights what is currently known regarding the impact of stress and the role of neuroendocrine mediators on network states and valence processing. Further, we propose a model in which chronic stress alters information routing through emotional processing hubs, resulting in a facilitation of negative valence processing and a suppression of positive valence processing.",en,2,0.0,0,{},0.0

In this light, a study was conducted to observe the responses of stem cutting of fig (Ficus sp.) of one exotic and two indigenous varieties (Teen- Ficus carica; wild fig- Ficus hispida and joggo fig- Ficus racemosa) in respect of duration of shade and anatomical status of stem. The study was laid in Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with two factors (duration of shade and cultivars) and three replications of the treatments. The four different treatments of shade duration were as T1= open or control, T2=3 days of shading, T3= 6 days of shading and T4= 9 days of shading. Data were collected on root and sprout growth of the cuttings at weekly interval from two weeks of planting the cuttings in sand filled plastic cups. When the duration of shading increased, the teen (Ficus carica) showed the longest sprout (1.59 mm) and root (2 mm) as well as maximum number of root (5.67) and sprout (2.33).

The relationship between SME risk perception and the consistency of this perception during the length of their business has not been investigated yet. The main aim of this article is to identify the most significant risks in the SMEs, to analyze the dependence among the degree of intensity of the observed financial, market and economic risks and the SME timeframe by selected statistical methods and tools. Building upon the empirical research implemented in 2017- 2018 and 2019-2020, it is possible to consider the market, financial and economic risks as the crucial risks negatively affecting the current business environment of the SMEs. The secondary aim of the article is to evaluate and compare the results of our research with the results of identical investigations in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland. Drawing from these findings, market risks affect the SME business environment highly negatively and are considered the most significant risks in all the examined countries. SME entrepreneurs in the V4 countries should thus increasingly support the process of applying risk management to ensure higher stability, performance and resilience of their businesses. The results are valuable for SMEs and institutions providing business support to strengthen the competitiveness of entrepreneurs in the V4 countries.

This study extended the comprehensive Harberger formula for deadweight loss (DWL) to account for the cross-price substitution effects between the gasoline and diesel markets, estimated the own-price and cross-price elasticities for gasoline and diesel in Africa, and predicted the DWL or economic cost created by gasoline and diesel subsidies in Ghana. Using the simple Harberger formula yields DWL estimates ranging from GHS 2.03 to 8.58 million per year from 2009 to 2014, but accounting for cross-price effects reduces the DWL estimates, from GHS 1.53 to 7.55 million per year, over the same period. However, because fuel demand is highly price inelastic, the DWL created for every GHS 1 million spent on gasoline and diesel subsidies only represents between 0.5% and 2% of subsidy expenditures. These findings suggest that fuel subsidy reforms would be better motivated by other social problems associated with fuel subsidies, such as the ineffective targeting of such subsidies to poorer consumers and the negative externalities of overconsumption, rather than the economic inefficiencies that fuel subsidies generate.",en,2,0.0,0,{},0.0

Given this focus of IO modeling on the multiplier, it is remarkable that IO analysis has not contributed to the recent macroeconomic debate on fiscal multiplier heterogeneity. This heterogeneity stems from differences in consumption reactions to income shocks and from downward wage rigidity. Both features are absent in most IO models. In this paper, a macroeconomic IO model with a wage function is set up, where at high unemployment rates, downward wage rigidity allows for large real income and multiplier effects. At full employment, demand shocks mainly induce price adjustments. The model reveals GDP multiplier heterogeneity in line with the recent macroeconomic literature, ranging from 0.3 (boom) to 1.4 (recession). The GDP multiplier result of the standard type II model even outperforms the multiplier in the recession case and therefore is most probably biased.",en,2,16647901.378658673,19,"{'Economics': 161215, 'History': 131967, 'Business': 72172, 'Mathematics': 13653, 'Physics': 9852, 'Art': 48172, 'Environmental science': 66686, 'Geography': 61910, 'Political science': 49512, 'Sociology': 94724, 'Engineering': 11113, 'Computer science': 17612, 'Philosophy': 62026, 'Psychology': 18893, 'Geology': 3387, 'Medicine': 3107, 'Materials science': 1792, 'Chemistry': 3750, 'Biology': 1117}",1.0

Halo-gravity traction (HGT) is a useful option that provides a gradual traction force to aid in deformity correction. Though its benefits are well-acknowledged, there still exist major ambiguities regarding its role in the management of complex spinal deformities. We performed a systematic review of the electronic databases including EMBASE, MEDLINE, PubMed, and Cochrane on November 12, 2021 to identify relevant articles on HGT; to analyze the existing literature on pre-operative HGT; and to compare the existing protocols for HGT in spinal deformity patients, its varied effects on the radiological parameters and general health status of the patients, and its associated complications. Among the 284 articles available in the literature, 34 articles were finally included and a total of 1151 patients [mean age, 14.6 years] were analyzed. Mean pre-traction coronal Cobb angle of 107° (72°–140.7°) was reduced by 24.8% [to a mean of 80.5° (42°–120.2°)] following HGT. Mean pre- and post-traction sagittal Cobb angles were 88° (56°–134.7°) and 65.4° (36°–113°; a reduction by 25.7%), respectively. Following HGT, mean body weight and body mass index (BMI) of patients improved by 7.2% and 9.1%, respectively. Mean improvement in forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume has been reported to be 14.5% and 13.9%, respectively. Pre-operative HGT is a useful option in the treatment of spinal deformities.

As agriculture became mechanized, combine harvesters leaves root-bound and scattered crop residues that are labor and cost intensive to remove, causing an increase in the recorded cases for burning of residues. The problem of stubble burning is more intense in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) of India due to highly mechanized farming practices, which leaves a huge amount of stubble in the field particularly after the harvest of rice. Traditionally, farmers collect crop residue to feed livestock manually. In this stubble burning study we explore the potential of the MODIS ""MCD14DL-NRT"" (Active Fire Data) product at a spatial resolution of 1000m available since November 2000, for the identification of fire prone areas in India. This study highlights the count of fire occurrences recorded from the MODIS Active Fire Data over a period of more than 20 years. During the months of October and November, which coincide with the paddy harvest season in the area an abrupt increase in fire activity is observed. The period of paddy harvesting, coupled with the onset of the winter season in the northern part of the country makes the region highly polluted and a breeding ground for numerous health problems for the citizens. In our study, we found that the state of Punjab records the majority of fires in India during this time period.",en,2,0.0,0,{},0.0

The current study investigates the energy price volatility in the aftermath of the Russia–Ukraine conflict, which is of high interest for designing effective government measures (such as monetary and energy policies) addressing the consequent changes occurring in employment, economic activity, commodity and food prices, and, ultimately, sustainable development. For the empirical analysis, we employed generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity models to capture the volatility of the following energy commodities: Brent crude oil, TTF natural gas, and UK natural gas. The empirical results reveal an elevated degree of persistence of the volatility, namely, that the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity term has a slow decay and pronounced fluctuations for all the energy products. The vulnerability of the EU’s energy policy to geopolitical factors is highlighted, especially for gas, which could be due to its dependence on Russian imports.

However, there is no consensus among the scholars whether military expenditures trigger economic growth, productivity, and other macroeconomic indicators. Such arguments are mainly due to unclear results obtained from the existing studies, in which the complex relationships between military expenditures and macroeconomics are not fully incorporated. Considering the bidirectional and nonlinear relationships among macroeconomic indicators and complex feedback mechanisms, a system dynamics (SD) model for examining the impacts of military expenditures on economic productivity in Turkey is proposed. The proposed SD model aims to reflect the complex environment surrounding the military spending–economic productivity nexus and to analyze the feedback structures that lead to miscellaneous consequences with delays.

In most laboratory experiments, specimens are free of stress at the start of the tests, and the load is increased systematically until failure occurs. Around excavations, the opposite path occurs, i.e., the rock is in equilibrium under a triaxial stress state and at least one stress component decreases while another component may increase. Hence, the stress paths in classic laboratory experiments are different from the in situ stress paths. In the research presented, a first step was made to evaluate with an open mind the effect of these different stress paths on the failure process and failure envelope. The research was based on distinct element models, allowing the simulation of micro-fracturing of the rock, which is essential to correctly model rock failure. The micro-fracturing when loading rock (from zero or low stress state) until failure was different from the micro-fracturing when unloading rock (from the in situ stress state) until failure. And, hence, by this difference in weakening processes, the failure envelopes were significantly different. The conventional loading resulted in the largest strength and, thus, overestimated the rock strength in comparison to the real in situ behaviour. This finding, after being confirmed by further lab experiments, will have a direct effect on how one characterises rock material and on the design of rock excavations.",en,2,0.0,0,{},0.0

Tree-based regression models outperformed all other ML models tested. Neural networks were not suitable for predicting saturated hydraulic conductivity. Clay content, followed by bulk density, explained the highest amount of variation in the data of the predictors examined. Abstract . One of the most important soil hydraulic properties for modeling water transport in the vadose zone is saturated hydraulic conductivity. However, it is challenging to measure it in the field. Pedotransfer Functions (PTFs) are mathematical models that can predict saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) from easily measured soil characteristics. Though the development of PTFs for predicting Ks is not new, the tools and methods used to predict Ks are continuously evolving. Model performance depends on choosing soil features that explain the largest amount of Ks variance with the fewest input variables. In addition, the lack of interpretability in most “black box” machine learning models makes it difficult to extract practical knowledge as the machine learning process obfuscates the relationship between inputs and outputs in the PTF models. The objective of this study was to develop a set of new PTFs for predicting Ks using machine learning algorithms and a large database of over 8000 soil samples (the Florida Soil Characterization Database) while incorporating statistical methods to inform predictor selection for the model inputs. Of the machine learning (ML) models tested, random forest regression (RF) and gradient-boosted regression (GB) gave the best performances, with R2 = 0.71 and RMSE = 0.47 cm h-1 on the test data for both. Using the permutation feature importance technique, the GB and RF regression models showed similar results, where clay content described the most variation in the data, followed by bulk density. The implication of this study is that, when predicting Ks using the Florida Soil Characterization Database, priority should be given to obtaining quality data on clay content and bulk density as they are the most influential predictors for estimating Ks.

By varying the disk's eccentricity $e$ and the P'eclet number $\Pe$, we distinguish five disk behaviors: stationary, steady, orbiting, periodic, and chaotic. We perform a global linear stability analysis (LSA) to predict the onset of instability and the most unstable eigenmode when a stationary disk spontaneously transitions to steady self-propulsion. In addition to the LSA, we use an alternative approach to determine the perturbation growth rate, offering valuable insights into the competing roles of advection and diffusion. The steady motion features a transition from a puller-type to a neutral-type swimmer as $\Pe$ increases, which occurs as a bimodal concentration profile at the disk surface shifts to a polarized solute distribution, driven by convective solute transport. An elliptic disk achieves an orbiting motion through a chiral symmetry-breaking instability, wherein it repeatedly follows a circular path while simultaneously rotating. The swinging periodic motion, emerging from a steady motion via a supercritical Hopf bifurcation, is characterized by a wave-like trajectory.

From this geometric principle, it follows algebraically that for any nonzero bedload transport, the bed (sediment-covered surface) must be tilted upward along the current's direction, forming ripples and dunes. These ideas are validated by making the first-ever accurate predictions of dune speeds (migration rates) that are derived solely from measurements of stoss side (s) and lee face length (l). This prediction has very high statistical significance: R2= 0.92, P = 2.0e-122, n=250.

Based on the fractography, there are multi-scale features closely related to the behavior of crack initiation and early growth in specific microstructure under different loading cycles. At macro-scale, the presence and location of crack initiation with a rough area (RA) are dominated by the external loads and the number of equiaxed α grains in local microstructure domain. At micro-scale, facets are the most prominent features as the mean stress and the failure life increase. There is a trade-off between facets and the granular RA surface in very-high-cycle fatigue (VHCF) under stress ratio R from a positive to a negative value. At nano-scale, due to numerous cyclic pressing, the microstructure underneath the fracture surface is refined to form nanograins and shaping the granules within RA region, which keeps a relatively high VHCF strength at R = −1.

Firstly, the TMT was carried out on INRAFM steel by reducing its thickness to 25% at warm rolling temperature (973 K), followed by tempering for 90 min at 1033 K. The resultant microstructural characteristics were compared with those attained in normalized and tempered (N+T) condition. TMT treated steel shows a refinement in lath structure with an increment in population of finer M23C6 precipitates along the hierarchal PAG/packet/block boundaries and MX carbonitrides in the intralath region. After TMT, creep tests were performed on the steel over the stress range of 200–300 MPa at temperature of 823 K. The rupture time of the steel significantly increased upon TMT, due to refinement in microstructural features that enhanced the creep resistance. Dependence of minimum creep rate on applied stress obeys Norton's power law and the stress exponent values indicated the deformation mechanism as dislocation creep. Modified Monkman-Grant relation shows a good relation between rupture time/strain to failure with minimum creep rate. Thereafter, the effect of TMT on the transient, secondary and tertiary creep behaviour was also examined and presented in this work.

To understand the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Macao population, we conducted an online survey during December 27-30, 2022. The survey was distributed online, mainly through social media such as the most popular instant messaging application in China “WeChat” or web link (https://f.wps.cn/w/02djQDa9/), and participation was anonymous and voluntary. General information such as previous or current COVID-19 infection, associated symptoms, and vaccination history were collected. COVID-19 infection was defined as having a positive RAT or NAT result.

However, it compensates the lack of surveillance in Macao and could monitor the future rebound due to emerging variants such as XBB. As China has now transitioned from managing COVID-19 infections to managing severe cases, early preparedness such as administrating booster vaccine to the elderly and high-risk population, and stockpiling of antivirals should reduce morbidity and mortality in the future epidemic waves.

After briefly referring to Arendt's difficult relationship with feminism, linking it to the struggle of Argentinian women for legalizing abortion, I look at Arendt's theorizing of the body in and beyond the private. I then argue for politicization of abortion as extrinsically enforced and rethink the role of the private in the context of abortion regulations and practices. In the closing section of my paper, I offer a micronarrative of the feminist street protests in Poland, and discuss it as an example of feminist revolutionary moment.KEYWORDS: Abortionfeminist phenomenologycritical phenomenologyHannah Arendtwomen's rightsphenomenology AcknowledgementsEarlier Versions of this paper have been presented at the following conferences: The Self and the Selfless.

This work is carried out according to the following steps: (i) model development with calculation methodology for velocity diagram flow angles applied to the low-pressure system; (ii) estimation of baseline low-pressure system design parameters from limited engine data (an integrated engine aircraft model developed in the Gasturb and MATLAB commercial softwares are applied); (iii) evaluation of the strategies to increase the low-pressure system component efficiencies and their implementation by computer simulation; (iv) reapplication of the calculation methodology for estimation of the velocity diagram flow angles considering the adjusted low-pressure system components; and (v) analysis of the adjustment proposal results considering the matching between the lowest specific fuel consumption and the net thrust required for the cruise flight phase of the aircraft. As a final result, it demonstrates that the proposed strategies are promising for the adjustment of the low-pressure system in the preliminary design scope, and this approach may be considered feasibility from the standpoint of the engine manufacturer implementation, since the engine core and its external sizing do not affected.",en,2,355806.3523583692,15,"{'Engineering': 39792, 'Physics': 21982, 'Art': 1102, 'Geography': 1659, 'Sociology': 901, 'Philosophy': 505, 'History': 508, 'Economics': 1381, 'Mathematics': 494, 'Environmental science': 247, 'Political science': 152, 'Computer science': 51, 'Business': 71, 'Psychology': 38, 'Materials science': 57}",1.0

Here, we present the consolidation of alkaline poly(ethylene) glycol-based lysis and solid-phase extraction for rapid and simple sample preparation compatible with direct on-bead amplification. Simultaneous cell lysis and binding of DNA were achieved using an optimised reagent comprising 15% PEG8000, 0.5 M NaCl, and 3.5 mM KOH. This was combined with direct, on-bead amplification using 1.5 μg beads per 20 μL PCR reaction mix. The novel single reagent, 5-min method improved the detection limit by 10 and 100-fold compared with commercial DNA extraction kits and the original alkaline PEG lysis method, respectively. The sensitivity can be further enhanced by one amplification cycle with an ethanol wash or by extending the incubation to 10 min before collecting the magnetic particles. Both methods successfully detected a single copy of Escherichia coli DNA. In biological fluids (saliva, sweat, and urine), the 5-min method was delayed by about one cycle compared to the 15-min method.

Developing microbial chassis for synthesizing value-added compounds is the most eco-friendly approach to minimize the impacts of overusing fossil fuels and other harsh chemicals. Recent research has focussed on harnessing microbial fatty acid metabolism to generate oleochemicals for use in industries as diverse as fuel production, cosmetics, lubricants and more. Considering the economic viability of generating “green biocatalysts”, we reconfigured the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway in an environmentally robust strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MTCC4796 to produce fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) with high yield and titer. We applied the push-pull-block strategy wherein a heterologous wax ester synthase ( WS2 ) was initially integrated to establish a FAEE biosynthetic pathway (pull) with additional rewiring including overexpression of PDH-bypass pathway genes for increasing the supply of precursor fatty acyl-CoA (push) and single allele disruption of non-essential genes from competing pathways (block) to maximize the metabolic flux towards FAEE overproduction. Our final engineered strain NGYT carrying 11 genetic modifications produced 26 mg/L and 1 g/L of FAEE before and after glucose optimization respectively. This titer was further scaled-up to reach 5 g/L in fed-batch bioreactors, which, to our knowledge, is the highest reported FAEE titer achieved from Saccharomyces cerevisiae with glucose as carbon source. Additionally, the FAEE’s produced by NGYT strain showed a higher percentage of monounsaturated fatty acids, which are ideally suitable for biodiesel applications.

In the time since its orbit insertion in early 2021, the Emirates Mars Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EMUS) on the Emirates Mars Mission (EMM) has been observing this hydrogen at 102.6 nm and 121.6 nm, H Lyman beta and Lyman alpha. Here we present H escape rates retrieved from these observations, obtained using a 3D radiative transfer model that simulates the brightness of both spectral lines, combining their information content to constrain the atmospheric state. In agreement with past results, we find that H escape peaks around Southern Summer solstice, after perihelion, exhibiting a more than 10x increase relative to Northern Summer conditions. Importantly, our retrievals extract information about both the hydrogen density and temperature, and do not require independent assumptions about the upper atmosphere temperature.

Aims This study aims to investigate the fire–atmosphere interaction and the accompanying energy transport processes within the convective boundary layer. Methods Three groups of large eddy simulations representing common ranges of convective boundary layer conditions and fire intensities were used to examine how ambient buoyancy-induced atmospheric turbulence impacts fire region energy transport. Key results In a relatively weak convective boundary layer, the fire-induced buoyancy force could impose substantial changes to the near-surface atmospheric turbulence and cause an anticorrelation of the helicity between the ambient atmosphere and the fire-induced flow. Fire-induced impact became much smaller in a stronger convective environment, with ambient atmospheric flow maintaining coherent structures across the fire heating region. A high-efficiency heat transport zone above the fire line was found in all fire cases. The work also found counter-gradient transport zones of both momentum and heat in fire cases in the weak convective boundary layer group. Conclusions We conclude that fire region energy transport can be affected by convective boundary layer conditions. Implications Ambient atmospheric turbulence can impact fire behaviour through the energy transport process. The counter-gradient transport might also indicate the existence of strong buoyancy-induced mixing processes.",en,2,11774427.999578714,19,"{'Physics': 27484, 'Environmental science': 59744, 'Philosophy': 29183, 'Engineering': 37935, 'Political science': 25258, 'History': 51711, 'Art': 28305, 'Mathematics': 12193, 'Geography': 38831, 'Psychology': 16105, 'Biology': 19265, 'Sociology': 44614, 'Business': 12249, 'Computer science': 10164, 'Medicine': 7538, 'Economics': 8885, 'Chemistry': 2314, 'Materials science': 755, 'Geology': 1011}",1.0

We developed a model which reproduces the expected 𝛾-𝛾 absorption between the very-high-energy 𝛾 rays interacting with the intense ultraviolet fields of both stars, assuming the two most likely orbital orientations. Thanks to its deep sensitivity, the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) has the potential to exclude one of the two orientations detecting fast spectral variability on daily/weekly timescale, when at periastron the orbital positions of the two stars vary the most. It can also constrain the magnetic field and the spatial locations where particles are accelerated to their highest energy via diffusive shock acceleration.

The goal of this work is to quantify how lens galaxies and lensed sources differ from their parent distribution, namely the strong lensing bias. Methods. We first studied how the strong lensing cross-section varies as a function of lens and source properties. Then, we simulated strong lensing surveys with data similar to that expected for Euclid and measured the strong lensing bias in different scenarios. We focused particularly on two quantities: the stellar population synthesis mismatch parameter, α sps , defined as the ratio between the true stellar mass of a galaxy and the stellar mass obtained from photometry, and the central dark matter mass at fixed stellar mass and size. Results. Strong lens galaxies are biased towards higher stellar masses, smaller half-mass radii, and higher dark matter masses. The amplitude of the bias depends on the intrinsic scatter in the mass-related parameters of the galaxy population and on the completeness in Einstein radius of the lens sample. For values of the scatter that are consistent with observed scaling relations and a minimum detectable Einstein radius of 0.5″, the strong lensing bias in α sps is 10%, while that in the central dark matter mass is 5%. The bias has little dependence on the properties of the source population: samples of galaxy-galaxy lenses and galaxy-quasar lenses that probe the same Einstein radius distribution are biased in a very similar way. Conclusions. Given current uncertainties, strong lensing observations can be used directly to improve our current knowledge of the inner structure of galaxies, without the need to correct for selection effects. Time-delay measurements of H 0 from lensed quasars can take advantage of prior information obtained from galaxy-galaxy lenses with similar Einstein radii.",en,2,1203217.740097612,18,"{'Physics': 86716, 'Materials science': 26174, 'Mathematics': 6283, 'Engineering': 11847, 'Economics': 14128, 'Art': 1053, 'Computer science': 1895, 'Chemistry': 2315, 'Environmental science': 3150, 'Philosophy': 1324, 'Political science': 1115, 'History': 1682, 'Geology': 861, 'Business': 843, 'Geography': 1102, 'Sociology': 1471, 'Psychology': 345, 'Biology': 38}",1.0

The LOME was a double-pulse event, and the two extinction pulses occurred in the late Katian – early Hirnantian (LOME-1) and middle Hirnantian (LOME-2). At present, the comprehensive driving mechanism of the two extinction pulses is still controversial. In this study, two cores (JY87 and JY143) from the middle Yangtze shelf in South China were selected as the research objects. Combined with previous research results, four main stressors, namely, volcanism, ocean redox, climate and nutrient supply, were analyzed. On this basis, the two-pulse driving mechanism of the LOME was comprehensively studied. The comprehensive mechanisms driving the two extinction pulses were different. During the LOME-1, the intensity of volcanism was relatively weak. Volcanic silicate weathering, high nutrients and long-term accumulation of high organic carbon burial flux may have jointly caused cold conditions and led to the expansion of the anoxic sulfide zone and enhancement of sulfidation. The cold conditions had less effect on deep-water benthos, but enhanced euxinia led to their extinction. In contrast, shallow-water benthos were less affected by the enhanced euxinia, but the cold conditions led to their extinction. During the LOME-2, a sudden and brief increase in volcanism that was extremely intense occurred, bringing in abundant nutrients and SO2, resulting in more widespread and long-lasting euxinia. This occurrence led to the extinction of benthos that survived during the LOME-1.",en,2,0.0,0,{},0.0

However, the timescale of their ‘defining’ trait evolution is incompletely understood because the fossil record of gigantic pliosaurids is scarce prior to the late-Middle Jurassic (Callovian), ~ 165.3 Ma. Here, we pinpoint the appearance of large body size and robust dentitions to early-Middle Jurassic (Bajocian) pliosaurids from northeastern France and Switzerland. These specimens include a new genus that sheds light on the nascent diversification of macropredatory pliosaurids occurring shortly after the Early-Middle Jurassic transition, around ~ 171 Ma. Furthermore, our multivariate assessment of dental character states shows that the first gigantic pliosaurids occupied different morphospace from coeval large-bodied rhomaleosaurid plesiosaurs, which were dominant in the Early Jurassic but declined during the mid-Jurassic, possibly facilitating the radiation and subsequent ecomorph acme of pliosaurids. Finally, we posit that while the emergence of macropredatory pliosaurids was apparently coordinated with regional faunal turnover in the epeiric basins of Europe, it paralleled a globally protracted extinction of other higher trophic-level marine reptiles that was not completed until after the earliest-Late Jurassic, ~ 161.5 Ma.",en,2,490655.1789025722,19,"{'Geography': 4845, 'Geology': 26092, 'Biology': 3762, 'Environmental science': 10238, 'Economics': 447, 'Art': 632, 'Psychology': 469, 'Computer science': 2194, 'Physics': 330, 'Engineering': 768, 'Business': 910, 'Political science': 614, 'History': 947, 'Mathematics': 1847, 'Philosophy': 268, 'Sociology': 434, 'Materials science': 318, 'Medicine': 56, 'Chemistry': 19}",1.0

In order to compare a Taguchi OA design to a two-level full factorial design to evaluate the systems at two separate sites (South Sinai and the Western Desert in Egypt), a design evaluation tool in DOE++ will be used. To pinpoint the crucial variables and analyze the impact of six different factors on eight different sets, Taguchi OA is used. The proportion of power shortfall is a production indicator, while the net present cost (NPC) and cost of energy (COE) are used as economic indicators. The simulation results demonstrate that W/D/B systems are economically viable for the hypothetical community site when using HOMER software, with electricity generated at a cost of about 0.285$/kWh without accounting for external benefits and 0.221$/kWh if CO 2 emissions are competitive with diesel-only systems, where COE is 0.432$/kWh. As a new evaluation approach, the Box-Cox transformation calculated the best λ is about −2 at the two locations, indicating similar technique behaviors, and the fitted probability shows, meaning that the significant impact of system components are wind turbines. Regression model of CO 2 emission is demonstrated to be successful for estimates at the Western Desert location than the South Sinai region",en,2,3482185.2625944675,20,"{'Engineering': 72997, 'Mathematics': 5669, 'Sociology': 28694, 'Environmental science': 20484, 'Philosophy': 9293, 'Physics': 21187, 'Art': 12615, 'Geography': 15973, 'History': 17521, 'Business': 4372, 'Psychology': 3077, 'Political science': 9221, 'Computer science': 2692, 'Biology': 1311, 'Economics': 2048, 'Materials science': 963, 'Geology': 186, 'Medicine': 473, 'Chemistry': 245, 'test': 342}",1.0

To better understand organic sulfur cycling in these systems, we followed organic sulfur in the sulfate‐poor (&lt; 40 μ M) iron‐rich (30–80 μ M) sediments of Lake Superior from source to sink. We identified microbial populations with shotgun metagenomic sequencing and characterized geochemical species in porewater and solid phases. In anoxic sediments, we found an active sulfur cycle fueled primarily by oxidized organic sulfur. Sediment incubations indicated a microbial capacity to hydrolyze sulfonates, sulfate esters, and sulfonic acids to sulfate. Gene abundances for dissimilatory sulfate reduction ( dsrAB ) increased with depth and coincided with sulfide maxima. Despite these indicators of sulfide formation, sulfide concentrations remain low (&lt; 40 nM) due to both pyritization and organic matter sulfurization. Immediately below the oxycline, pyrite accounted for 13% of total sedimentary sulfur. Both free and intact lipids in this same interval accumulated disulfides, indicating rapid sulfurization even at low concentrations of sulfide. Our investigation revealed a new model of sulfur cycling in a low‐sulfate environment that likely extends to other modern lakes and possibly the ancient ocean, with organic sulfur both fueling sulfate reduction and consuming the resultant sulfide.",en,2,0.0,0,{},0.0

In the present study, we develop a forecast model of radiation belt electron fluxes based on the data assimilation method, in terms of Van Allen Probe measurements combined with three-dimensional radiation belt numerical simulations.

Our model can reasonably predict the storm-time evolution of radiation belt electrons with high prediction efficiency (up to ~0.8–1). The best prediction performance is found for ~0.3–3 MeV electrons at <italic>L</italic> = ~3.25–4.5, which extends to higher <italic>L</italic> and lower energies with increasing pitch angle.

Whilst researchers in numerous disciplines have attempted to uncover the origins, nature, and effects of mental fatigue, the literature is marked by many contradictory findings. We identified two major methodological problems for mental fatigue research. First, researchers rarely use objective measures of mental fatigue. Instead, they rely heavily on subjective reports as evidence that mental fatigue has been induced in participants. We aimed to develop a task which led to not only a subjective increase in mental fatigue, but a corresponding performance decrement in the mentally fatiguing task as an objective measure. Secondly, current mental fatigue paradigms have low ecological validity – in most prior studies participants have been fatigued with a single repetitive task such as the n-back or Stroop. To move towards a more ecologically valid paradigm, our participants undertook a battery of diverse cognitive tasks designed to challenge different aspects of executive function. The AX-CPT, n-back, mental rotation, and visual search tasks were chosen to challenge response inhibition, working memory, spatial reasoning, and attention. We report results from 45 participants aged 19 to 63 years who completed a two-hour battery comprising four different cognitive tasks. Subjective fatigue ratings and task performance were measured at the beginning and end of the battery. Our novel method resulted in an increase in subjective ratings of fatigue ( p &lt; 0.001) and a reduction in task performance ( p = 0.008).

At the same time, the fatigue crack growth rate of WZ under different stress ratios is studied. The results show that the difference of microstructure leads to different fatigue crack growth rates in different areas of welded joints. The HAZ shows better fatigue crack growth resistance and slower fatigue crack growth rate. However, due to the burning loss of Zn element in the WZ, the precipitation of strengthening phase after solidification in the molten pool is less, and the fatigue crack propagation resistance is weak. After 60 days of natural aging, the number of precipitated phases in the WZ and HAZ increased, and the fatigue crack propagation resistance is improved compared with that in the welded condition.

Negative user experiences in particular are a key barrier to increased bike riding participation. However, existing research has not considered the theoretical mechanisms that give rise to subjective experiences while bike riding. To achieve a more nuanced understanding necessary to enable subjective experiences to contribute to policy and planning, there is a need to both establish theoretically-informed definitions of what subjective experiences consist of, and common approaches to describing how they arise and can be measured. This conceptual paper addresses a translation gap between theory and existing research by applying the transactional model of stress and coping and the circumplex model of affect to demonstrate potential causal mechanisms and measurement approaches of bicycling-related subjective experiences. The transactional model of stress and coping proposes that individuals continuously appraise the demands of their environment relative to their coping abilities, stating that stress and negative emotions occur when an environment exceeds perceived coping abilities. The circumplex model of affect proposes that emotions exist on dimensions of valence and arousal, measuring the unpleasant-pleasantness and degree of activation of an emotion from low to high, respectively.

But there is one lens through which we can gain a glimpse of how all these dimensions, including changing lifeways, fluid identities, ethnopolitics, historical legacies, and cultures work together: Mongolian music or music-making. Mongolian Sound Worlds, edited by Jennifer C. Post, Sunmin Yoon, and Charlotte D'Evelyn, vividly weaves all these threads together into a multicolored tapestry.The book begins with an introduction by Sunmin Yoon and then is divided into four parts, with each part opening with an interlude where local practitioners' viewpoints are introduced. The first part, “Landscapes and Soundscapes,” is unveiled by a Kazakh song lyric shared by a Kazakh herder named Oktyabr. There, the intricate relations between land, spirit, and sound worlds are dealt with poetically as shown in this stanza, “Flowers blow on the edges of Aqsay, stones from the mountain shine like silver, Ülken buyra and Shunkir qora are famous, since olden days they were Qaraqas's place” (19). This theme is taken up and further elaborated in chapter 1 by Jennifer C. Post, who focuses on how music-making constitutes place-making and memory-making and how musical practices shape and are shaped by changing lifeways. She specifically relates the musical practices of Kazakh pastoralists in the far-western Mongolian province of Bayan-Ölgii and argues that “their songs and melodies are well-integrated in local landscapes, and their melodies and lyrics also contribute to memories of nature for those living in urban or semi-urban areas as well as diaspora communities around the world” (43).The second part, “Ethnicity and Diversity,” opens with an interlude in which a young Inner Mongolian musician, Tamir Hargana, talks about his own musical journey as he traverses various spatial boundaries. In chapter 2, D'Evelyn explores a spectrum of fluid Mongolian identities in Inner Mongolia against the backdrop of China's ethnic policies and she specifically deals with the ways in which Anda Union, an internationally successful Inner Mongolian folk ensemble, negotiates intra-Mongol diversities and the ethno-political landscape of China. Chapter 3 investigates the theme of diversity within the state of Mongolia focusing on how urtyn duu styles from various sub-ethnic groups in the western provinces of Mongolia, termed the west-melodies (baruun ayalguu), are positioned vis-à-vis the east-melodies (zuun ayalguu) of the central Khalkha. Yoon, in this chapter, argues that cultural hierarchy, geographical locations, and the formation of Khalkha-centralized nation during the socialist times all play roles in how people talk about and evaluate urtyn duu from the western or eastern regions of Mongolia. Chapter 4 by Rebekah Plueckhahn, taking women's musical practice as an analytical entry point, reveals the intricate ways in which women's musical practices are interlinked with their cultivation of moral personhood and women's social roles in Mongolian culture.The third part, “Material and Social History,” introduces musical instruments from different regions from the perspectives of their makers and performers. In Interlude 3, the horsehead-fiddle (morin khuur) maker Bayarsaikhan Badamsüren introduces the process of instrument-making and shares his thoughts about the significance of this instrument for Mongols. In chapter 5, Peter Marsh and D'Evelyn further show how the sociohistorical life of the constant changes of morin khuur as an instrument is interwoven with the life experience of and professional trajectories led by three legendary fiddlers from both Mongolia and Inner Mongolia and two contemporary fiddle players. In chapter 6, Otgonbayar Chuluunbaatar introduces the material composition of and visual symbols on the plucked two-stringed tovshuur in the Oirad Mongolian region in western Mongolia and discusses the instrument's inseparable ties with local epic singing practices. Post in chapter 7 lays out the social lives of a Kazakh instrument, the dombyra, through introducing four dombyra makers in two western provinces of Mongolia. She examines the impact of the local environment and the increasing cross-border movements of Mongolian Kazakhs on dombyra making.The fourth part, “Heritage and Globalization,” deals with the key question of how Mongolian music-making has evolved in response to nationalization and globalization processes. In the interlude of this part, Andrew Colwell, through a reconstruction of his conversation with the throat-singer (khöömiich) Tserendavaa Dashdorj, offers keywords to be explored in this section: nature, sound, tradition, change, loss, ambivalence, and more importantly, a glimmer of hope toward the future of Mongolian music. As Tserendavaa Dashdor comments, “Everything in the universe has two paths . . . world development is entering Mongolia, opening up all kinds of good and bad paths” (201). Elaborating on this theme of ambivalent changes, in chapter 8, Johanni Curtet introduces the transforming status of khöömii and its important practitioners. The genre has shifted from a nomadic sonic practice to an increasingly standardized and institutionalized musical genre during the socialist era and then to a form of “intangible heritage.” The process of institutionalization and heritagization of khöömii inevitably brought its place of “origin”—Chandman’ sum in Khovd aimag from where many renowned throat-singers hailed—to the fore and the question of how far khöömii has traveled till today grips readers in the end. In chapter 9, Andrew Colwell, using khöömii and ensembles (khamtlag) as main prisms, shows that what Mongols perceived as tradition (yazguur) is constantly shifting in relation to different sociopolitical, cultural, and economic lives experienced by them. In the final chapter, discussing Mongolia's most recent popular music sensation, the folk metal group the Hu, Marsh explores Mongolia's early popular music history and underlines today's Mongolian musicians' increasing ability to navigate the global music landscape through creating unique and syncretic sounds. The Hu’s “unique tweaking of past practices and innovative embrace of new ones will serve as a model for other artists seeking to bring Mongolian music to global audiences” (268).This is a book of many strengths. A close collaboration with Indigenous musicians and instrument makers combined with a companion website for the volume rendered the work multivocal and exceptionally rich. The four interludes also saved the volume from falling into just a set of casually linked chapters—a fate that befalls many edited volumes. But it appears to me that, at times, the boundaries within Mongolian peoples are overdrawn to underline the diversity in Mongolian musical worlds. This is mostly caused by the translation of yastan into “ethnic group” to demarcate intra-Mongol peoples, as shown for instance in Yoon's chapter (95, 101). Similarly, D'Evelyn's chapter 2 states that “Mongols across Inner Mongolia . . . often emphasize more differences between one another than similarities” (63). This is an overstatement and it only applies in specific contexts, such as when musicians highlight local genres and identities to mark their styles as different. These minor contentions aside, Mongolian Sound Worlds is a compelling contribution to the fields of ethnomusicology, Inner Asia studies, heritage studies, sociolinguistics, and folklore studies. In addition, the volume provides an accessible overview of the Mongolian sound practices and it is an excellent resource for undergraduates and postgraduate students.",en,2,0.0,0,{},0.0

Implications for Oil-Source CorrelationsSummary The Epirus region in Western Greece demonstrates important hydrocarbon potential indicated by widespread oil-seeping, which proves that all elements and processes of a petroleum system are present and active. This study compares biomarker signatures of biodegraded solid bitumen samples from 3 sites [Petousi, Elataria and Vassiliko (the last two SB yet unreported)], with those from source rock samples obtained from two of the most promising oil-prone source rocks outcropping in Epirus i.e., the Pantokrator Shale and the Toarcian Lower Posidonia Shale, aiming to assess oil affinities. Petousi and Elataria solid bitumens were both found filling joints within the sediments of the Toarcian Lower Posidonia Shale Fm, whereas Vassiliko solid bitumen was obtained from Triassic collapse-breccias. The results suggest that the solid bitumen in Elataria Lower Posidonia Shale exhibits geochemical similarity to the Lower Posidonia Shale source rock. Petousi solid bitumen although found in Lower Posidonia Shale source rock has likely derived form the adjacent Pantokrator Shale of Pantokrator bituminous limestones. Vassiliko solid bitumen likely originate from a source matching Pantokrator Shale geochemical characteristics. Moreover, bitumen yields of these source rocks indicate that Pantokrator Shale generation potential well exceeds that of the Lower Posidonia Shale.",en,2,1439783.808803195,19,"{'Geology': 129261, 'Chemistry': 25764, 'Geography': 8295, 'Economics': 7210, 'Materials science': 4537, 'History': 6831, 'Psychology': 7257, 'Environmental science': 7420, 'Engineering': 690, 'Philosophy': 3009, 'Computer science': 1385, 'Biology': 3625, 'Mathematics': 986, 'Sociology': 1753, 'Medicine': 3325, 'Physics': 682, 'Business': 892, 'Art': 886, 'Political science': 694}",1.0

However, the existing methods ignore the data noise caused by water sensors working in harsh conditions and the intrinsic variable dynamics inherent in the time series of wastewater quality. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel approach called wt-ResLSTM (wavelet transform and Residual Long Short-Term Memory) to predict the influent wastewater quality. Specifically, we adopt wavelet transform and semi-soft thresholding to remove the noise from influent wastewater quality data adaptively. Then, we use autoencoder to learn the latent representation of the recent fluctuation of wastewater quality to capture its transient uncertainty. Further, the residual LSTM is adopted to learn both the long-term and short-term sequential dependencies of influent wastewater quality from the historical wastewater quality and the latent representation of its recent fluctuation. Experiments on the dataset from a large-scale urban WWTP in Beijing demonstrate that the proposed wt-ResLSTM approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in predicting influent wastewater quality in terms of level accuracy and directional accuracy.",en,2,15012276.26316902,20,"{'Computer science': 93988, 'Political science': 31846, 'History': 63134, 'Engineering': 15414, 'Environmental science': 51053, 'Geography': 44204, 'Medicine': 11804, 'Mathematics': 48144, 'Psychology': 28416, 'Art': 33622, 'Physics': 2777, 'Sociology': 61377, 'Business': 16988, 'Economics': 12065, 'Geology': 7259, 'Philosophy': 33961, 'Chemistry': 3627, 'Biology': 7160, 'Materials science': 8302, 'test': 378}",1.0

These progresses have only marginally benefited infrared-inactive transitions, due to their inherently weak cross-sections. Here we overcome this limitation by introducing stimulated-Raman-scattering metrology, where a frequency comb is exploited to calibrate the frequency detuning between the pump and Stokes excitation lasers. We apply this approach to the investigation of molecular hydrogen, which is a recognized benchmark for tests of quantum electrodynamics and of theories that describe physics beyond the standard model. Specifically, we measure the transition frequency of the Q(1) fundamental line of H 2 around 4155 cm −1 with few parts-per-billion uncertainty, which is comparable to the theoretical benchmark of ab initio calculations and more than a decade better than the experimental state of the art.

As main acclimatization mechanisms in feijoa saplings under 80% shade were developed larger leaf area, reduced leaf blade thickness, and enhanced quantum yield of photosystem II. Even so, the net CO2 assimilation and the electron transport rate was lower and, consequently, there was a restriction on the growth and dry mass in saplings under deep shade.

The results indicate that the ultimate scouring depths of piles with grouting were significantly lesser than those without it during scouring. Additionally, it was observed that grouting protection can considerably enhance the ultimate horizontal bearing capacity under static loading. The limit equilibrium method was employed to determine the ultimate horizontal bearing capacity of monopiles. Two models were proposed for piles with grouting protection––the pile-reinforced sediment model (Model A) and the composite pile model (Model B).

New drugs have been introduced, including the group of drugs called Angiotensin receptor Neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI), but due to their high cost, angiotensin-converting enzymes inhibitors (ACEIs) and Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been mostly used in Tanzania. However, according to our knowledge, the efficacy comparison of the two groups is yet to be studied in Tanzania. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of ACEIs and ARBs among patients with heart failure. Methodology This was a hospital-based prospective cohort study done at Jakaya Kikwete Cardiac Institution (JKCI), Tanzania, from June to December 2020. Consecutive enrollment was done until fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Clinical details were measured at baseline. We assessed the relationship between ARBs and ACEI users with N-terminal pro-Brain natriuretic peptide (NT pro-BNP) levels at admission and at 1-month follow-up using a chi-square test. A Kaplan-Meier curve was used to estimate the survival time of the two groups. Results 155 HF patients were enrolled, with a mean age of 48 years, whereby 52.3% were male, and their mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 37.3%. 52 (33.5%) heart failure patients were on ACEIs, 57 (36.8%) on ARBs, and 46 (29.7%) were neither using ACEIs nor ARBs. At least half of the patients did not receive a Guideline directed medical therapy (GDMT), with only 82 (52.9%) receiving a GDMT. A drop in NT pro-BNP levels was observed during admission and at 1-month follow-up on both groups, from 6389.2pg/ml to 4000.1pg/ml for ARB users and 5877.7pg/ml to 1328.2pg/ml for the ACEIs users. There was no statistical difference between the two groups when estimated by the Kaplan-Meier curve, though, more deaths were observed in those who were neither on ACEIs nor ARBs, with a calculated P value of 0.01. Conclusion This study demonstrates that ACEIs have more efficacy and overall better clinical outcome than ARBs, but this should be taken under the patient-based case, considering the side effects of ACEIs and patients’ adherence.",en,2,0.0,0,{},0.0

This research investigated the feasibility of employing waste from marble mining byproducts to make structural concrete. This study replaced various percentages of marble with fine aggregates to determine their effects on compressive strength, bending strength, impact behavior, and water absorption of sustainable self-compacting concrete (SCC). Regarding the effects of recycled marble aggregates on mechanical properties, it has been discovered that substituting marble waste with sand can increase compressive and flexural strength. It has been determined, via testing on disk samples, that the amount of steel fibers have a much greater effect on the impact resistance of the specimens than the amount of recycled components. Fiber bridging has been shown to significantly affect the final strength of specimens containing fibers and the number of blows required for the first surface fracture to appear in fiber-containing specimens. This is in comparison to the sample that served as the reference. In addition to this, increasing the replacement percentage of recycled aggregates in the specimens causes them to have a greater resistance to the impact loads applied to them.

To solve the problem of poor metallurgical bonding of Cu/Al bimetallic composites caused by high-temperature oxidation of Cu, different coating thicknesses of Ni layer on Cu rods were used to fabricate the Cu/Al bimetallic composite by gravity casting. The effect of liquid–solid volume ratio and coating thickness on microstructure and properties of a Cu/Al bimetallic composite were investigated in this study. The results indicated that the transition zone width increased from 242.3 μm to 286.3 μm and shear strength increased from 17.8 MPa to 30.3 MPa with a liquid–solid volume ratio varying from 8.86 to 50. The thickness of the transition zone and shear strength increased with the coating thickness of the Ni layer varying from 1.5 μm to 3.8 μm, due to the Ni layer effectively preventing oxidation on the surface of the Cu rod and promoting the metallurgical bonding of the Cu/Al interface.

However, how their interactions with midlatitude flows alter the characteristics of HREs has remained unclear. The present study examines the synoptic-dynamic characteristics of HREs directly resulting from TCs in South Korea with a focus on the role of midlatitude baroclinic condition. The HREs are categorized into two clusters based on midlatitude tropopause patterns: i.e., strongly (C1) and weakly (C2) baroclinic conditions. The C1, which is common in late summer, is characterized by a well-defined trough-ridge couplet and jet streak at the tropopause. As TCs approach, the trough-ridge couplet amplifies but is anchored by divergent TC outflow. This leads to phase locking of the upstream trough with TCs and thereby prompts substantial structural changes of TCs reminiscent of extratropical transition. The synergistic TC–midlatitude flow interactions allow for enhanced quasigeostrophic forcing over a broad area. This allows HREs to occur even before TC landfall with more inland rainfall than C2 HREs. In contrast, C2, which is mainly observed in mid-summer, does not accompany the undulating tropopause. In the absence of strong interactions with midlatitude flows, TCs rapidly dissipate after HREs while maintaining their tropical features. The upward motion is confined to the inherent TC convection, and thus HREs occur only when TCs are located in the vicinity of the country. These findings suggest that midlatitude baroclinic condition determines the spatial extent of TC rainfall and the timing of TC-induced HREs in South Korea.",en,2,0.0,0,{},0.0

This article unpacks the main features of this new form of European gouvernement économique. The article focuses particularly on the set of policies adopted by two key actors in European economic and financial sector governance – the European Commission and the European Central Bank (ECB) – to advance the ‘green transition’ toward a carbon neutral EU economy by 2050. The new EU gouvernement économique aims to steer the Union towards a ‘net zero’ emissions economy by 2050, albeit important recent studies (European Court of Auditors 2023) have raised concerns that this ambition may not be realistic. It has larger financial means at its disposal considering the ‘traditional’ EU budget, combined with newly set-up supranational investment funds available through the NextGenerationEU (NGEU) programme. Moreover, it unfolds in a more complex polycentric system of EU economic governance (Ostrom 2010; Schmidt 2023; Vogler 2020; van Zeben and Bobic 2019) than envisioned in the older gouvernement économique blueprints of the 1990s. Faced with ‘wicked’ policy problems in this decentralized governance setting, such as the climate crisis, a global public health crisis and war at its doorstep, the EU institutions have to resolve the tension between multiple policy objectives, such as pursuing economic growth and ensuring low inflation. Table 1 provides an overview of the main distinctive features of the EU's ‘new’ gouvernement économique, focusing particularly on features that show a clear contrast in the 2020s, compared to the earlier blueprints from the 1990s. Financial instruments (EU level) Prevailing mode of governance Centralized, Commission in the lead. Decentralized, Commission as an orchestrator, together with other EU institutions, such as the ECB In short, this article argues that the European ‘green economy’ to support the green transition has superseded the older concept of gouvernement économique as an organizing principle of contemporary EU economic and financial sector governance. An integrated analysis of the recently adopted EU economic and financial sector governance policies and reforms as well as the (new) financial instruments launched in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic yields three important findings summarized below, which form the axes of this article. First, the European Commission has reinforced and expanded its leading role in steering European economic governance through a mission-oriented policy approach (Mazzucato 2018), especially considering its leading role in the European Green Deal (EGD). Its leadership was shown by issuing the NGEU ‘corona recovery’ bonds and by monitoring the implementation of the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) in the member states, now integrated in the European Semester. Second, now the Commission has substantial financial means which it can steer toward achieving the Union's long-term green transition. These expanded financial means become evident when we consider in an integrated way the traditional EU budgetary instruments in the multi-annual financial framework (MFF) 2021–2027, supplemented with the new EU investment mechanism NGEU to fund the green transition, foster the Union's economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and the special financial assistance instrument European Stability Mechanism albeit outside the ‘regular’ EU decision-making framework. In fact, the EU is projected to become the fifth largest bond issuer by 2025, compared to the individual EU member states (European Commission 2023a). Third, the Commission works closely with the member states and with other EU institutions, such as the ECB, as an ‘orchestrator’ in the contemporary complex polycentric system of EU economic and financial sector governance. In contrast to earlier EU economic governance blueprints, the current approach does not seek further centralization and a hierarchical organization. Rather, it entails transferring more responsibility to and demanding more commitment from the member states in order to accommodate diverse national growth models, developmental trajectories and preferences (Ban and Helgadóttir 2022; Blyth et al. 2022; Hodson and Howarth 2023; Mertens et al. 2021). The Commission's interaction with the ECB is particularly important to unpack, as the ECB has taken a firm stance to support the transition to a carbon-neutral economy while, of course, staying within its policy remit of keeping prices stable and banks safe. Furthermore, inflationary pressures have become a challenge for citizens and businesses alike during 2021 and 2022. Rising inflation has negatively impacted citizens, while the rising interest rates to tame inflation have generated unintended consequences for bank balance sheets and, ultimately, for the stability of the European banking sector. These developments have prompted further actions by the ECB to reconcile the policy objectives of financial and economic stability, on the one hand, and price stability, on the other hand, especially in the aftermath of Covid-19 (Quaglia and Verdun 2023). The next sections elaborate on each of these three axes in turn. It is, of course, important to note that the concept of an EU gouvernement économique has a rather polarizing track record in European political economy. The earlier blueprints from the 1990s reflect heavily French economic thinking at the time, for example, former French Prime Minister Pierre Bérégovoy's proposals. These blueprints aimed for more coordinated fiscal and economic policies of the EU member states through the Stability and Growth Pact and the annual macro-economic policy evaluation cycles conducted by the Commission, which offered an unprecedented insight into national economic thinking and planning (see Howarth 2002 and Verdun 2000 for the role of French policymakers in this debate; Dyson 2002). However, critics of the concepts emphasized the contested adoption of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, evoking connotations of supranational dirigisme, driven by a Commission detached from the member states' national economic priorities and concerns, even threatening to stifle vibrancy and innovation, thus potentially damaging the competitive edge of the ‘Northern core’ economies (Dyson 2002; Howarth and Verdun 2020). Since the early 2000s, the aptly named ‘post-functionalist’ turn (Hooghe and Marks 2009) has only given rise to a more polarized public opinion in the EU member states, greater Euroscepticism and more contestation regarding the place and the role of the EU in coordinating and guiding member states' national economic policies (Börzel 2016; Halikiopoulou 2018). Let us now take stock of the distinctive features of the recent EU economic and financial sector reforms to foster the green transition. To begin with, the European Commission has reinforced and expanded its leading role in steering European economic and financial sector governance, especially through leading the implementation of the EGD, issuing the NGEU corona recovery bonds and monitoring the implementation of the RRF, now integrated in the European Semester. It is notable that the Commission has opted not to work through hierarchical governance modes, such as centralization and maximum harmonization, which are increasingly seen as politically controversial, especially for the member states. To the contrary, in guiding the green economy transition, the Commission gives more space to the member states to choose their national economic policies in the RRFs, tailored to their own developmental priorities and objectives. The Commission has opted for a more accommodating approach in monitoring and guiding the implementation of the RRFs in the European Semester, perhaps reflecting criticisms of excessive dirigisme and top-down steering during earlier cycles, especially during the eurozone crisis (Schelkle 2017). Recognizing the threats posed by climate change and environmental degradation, the Commission led by Ursula von der Leyen launched the EGD in 2020, with the ambitious mission to make the EU ‘the first climate-neutral continent’ by 2050 (European Commission 2021). While this goal still echoes the so-called ‘Lisbon agenda’ to modernize the European economy and ensure its global competitiveness as well as social inclusion, the EGD displays the features of mission-oriented innovation policy (MOIP) approach (Mazzucato 2018). The EGD seeks to achieve no net emissions of greenhouse gases in the EU by 2050 and a shift toward a new economic growth model decoupled from resource use, inviting the active participation and contribution of the private sector and citizens (European Commission 2021). The Commission has explicitly relied on Mazzucato's (2018) ‘mission-oriented approach’ for the EU economy to navigate economic change in contemporary capitalism, considering the magnitude of the policy challenge to deliver on the EGD. According to this approach, coordinating public and private sector policies on a massive scale is necessary to radically change the mechanisms that govern the (economic) value distribution. New types of MOIP collaborations, especially public–private partnerships, are particularly important. This is visible in contemporary EU economic governance when we consider the ‘industrial policy’ component of the EGD. For example, the Commission (2021) has stressed that ‘the Green transition presents a major opportunity for European industry by creating markets for clean technologies and products’. It recognizes that the legislative and policy proposals implementing the EGD affect entire value chains in sectors, such as energy and transport, agriculture, construction and renovation, and have the potential for new, and more sustainable, job creation in the member states in these sectors through a more pro-active industrial policy. Especially since the mid-2010, there has been a clear rise and renewed attention given to EU industrial policy as well as greater integration of different industrial policy functions at the supranational EU level (Bulfone 2023; Di Carlo and Schmitz 2023). The interplay of functional, cultivated and political spillovers, driven especially by the Franco-German backing of more pro-EU industrial policy positions since 2016, explains the timing of the rise of this more ambitious and far-reaching EU industrial policy (Di Carlo and Schmitz 2023). Nevertheless, the nature of the policy area and related externalities explain why some areas, such as ‘clean’ energy production, have advanced faster than others (Di Carlo and Schmitz 2023; Prontera and Quitzow 2022). Second, now the Commission has substantial financial means, which it can mobilize to achieve the long-term green transition objectives of the Union. These expanded financial means become evident when considering in an integrated way the traditional EU budgetary instruments in the MFF 2021–2027 with the new EU investment mechanism NGEU to fund the green transition and foster the Union's economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. The start of the implementation of NGEU in 2021 means that EU bonds are already here, even though both public opinion and key member states remain divided on the desirability (and viability) of common EU bonds as a ‘solidarity’ financial instrument to raise capital and pay up for common EU policy objectives. In fact, the Commission's (n.d.) recent rhetoric on debt issuance stresses that ‘it [the Commission] is a well-established name in debt securities markets, with a strong track record of successful bond issuances over the past 40 years’. Importantly, the recently adopted NGEU package marks a radical departure from previous EU economic and financial policy constrained by the ‘balanced budget’ rule at the EU level, with deficit spending precluded by the EU treaties. The Commission now has temporary powers to borrow from the international financial markets in order to finance NGEU and, consequently, implement the EGD (for more on the EGD, see Dyrhauge and Kurze 2023; Eckert 2021). In general, EU borrowing is executed using multiple instruments, including EU Bonds, EU Bills and NGEU Green Bonds (European Commission n.d.). There are precedents for joint EU borrowing with a very limited remit, for example, for Euratom, SURE (the EU's programme to finance short-term employment schemes across the EU and keep people in jobs during the Covid-19 pandemic) and the Macro-Financial Assistance+ programme for Ukraine, but NGEU Green Bonds scale up this borrowing considerably. In fact, the amount is such that the EU as an entity is projected to become the Union's fifth largest bond issuer by 2025, placed immediately after the four largest eurozone bond issuers, namely, France, Italy, Germany and Spain (European Commission 2023a). Furthermore, through issuing up to €250 billion of ‘green bonds’ as part of NGEU funding plans, the Commission will become the largest issuer of green bonds globally (European Commission 2023a). This significant development regarding the EU as a borrower further substantiates Braun and Gabor's (2020) findings about the growing ‘infrastructural entanglement’ of the EU (economic) institutions in financialization. Whereas Braun and Gabor (2020) unpacked how the ECB has ‘advocated and actively promoted, for monetary policy purposes, the development of shadow banking and shadow money’, this article extends their argument, showing that, furthermore, the Commission plays a leading role as an issuer of green bonds on behalf of the EU, deepening the EU's infrastructural entanglement with global financial markets. The financial backing to implement the EGD intersects in important ways with the EU's Covid-19 recovery fund, NGEU. At least one third of the investments from the NGEU financial package and the EU's 7-year budget (the MFF 2021–2027) have been pledged for financing the EGD (European Commission 2021). Loans from the European Investment Bank will also be mobilized. Taken together, the MFF 2021–2027 and NGEU have raised a total €2.018 trillion to implement the EU's policy priorities over the next 7 years, which is an unprecedented financial resource available at the EU level. The EU's regular long-term budget, the MFF, accounts for €1.210 trillion of the total amount and NGEU accounts for €806.9 million to supplement the regular EU budget. Furthermore, NGEU funding has been earmarked to top up the following MFF budgetary headings (in order of magnitude of the contribution): ‘Cohesion, Resilience and Values’ – €426.7 million (+ €776.5 from NGEU); ‘Natural Resources and Environment’ – €401 million (+ 18.9 from NGEU); and ‘Single Market, Innovation and Digital’ – €149.5 (+ €11.5 from NGEU). Third, the Commission now works closely with the member states and with other EU institutions, such as the ECB and EU agencies as an orchestrator in the contemporary complex polycentric system of EU economic governance. The orchestration analytical framework (Abbott et al. 2020) helps understand the new role of the Commission and the ECB in the EU's contemporary more complex system of polycentric economic governance. Orchestration is a form of indirect governance. The orchestrator works through the intermediary to influence the governance target, and it is ‘soft’ because the orchestrator often lacks authoritative control over the intermediaries and the targets in a classical principal-agent delegation sense (Abbott et al. 2020, p. 21). An orchestration approach may be desirable in contemporary EU economic governance to mitigate the effects of growing public opinion polarization and Euroscepticism, as the Commission relinquishes direct ‘control’ and seeks instead to co-create the national economic programmes together with the member state governments, allowing much more space for national discretion and national economic priorities. 1 On the one hand, the contemporary EU economic governance system is complex, polycentric and more decentralized simply because there are more relevant venues of policy-making in the multi-level EU governance system, considering also the EU's embeddedness in global governance (see also Schmidt 2023). On the other hand, complexity and polycentricity are magnified by the types of contemporary economic policy problems that the EU faces. These tend to be wicked policy problems, such as the climate crisis, that have multiple interconnected dimensions, and the solutions of one problem may impinge upon or constrain the range of possible solutions to another policy problem (Head and Alford 2015). The Commission's interaction with the ECB is particularly important to unpack, as the ECB has taken a firm stance to support the transition to a carbon-neutral economy, while of course staying within its policy remit of keeping prices stable and banks safe (Siderius 2022). On the one hand, inflationary pressures became a challenge for citizens and businesses alike in the course of 2022. On the other hand, rising central bank interest rates to rein in inflation generated unintended consequences for banks' balance sheets and, ultimately, for the stability of the European banking sector. Let us unpack the tension between the economic growth policy objective and the low inflation policy objective, especially from the perspective of the Commission and the ECB. A review of the Union's economic and financial policies in 2022 suggests that the Commission is placing more importance on economic growth, especially in the implementation of the member states' green transition RRF plans. At a Eurogroup conference, EU Economy Commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni, emphasized that the EU economy saw strong and continuous growth between 2014 and 2019 and rebounded in 2022, after the Covid-19 pandemic. He also stressed that ‘the expansionary fiscal stance of the past three years, joined with the ECB's monetary policy, was decisive to support the euro area economy … I think we should be proud of these decisions and the impact they had preserving our economy’ (European Commission 2023b). This is why the Commission's country-specific recommendations as part of the European semester acknowledge the need for a more restrictive fiscal policy, but overall prioritize ‘the crucial investments that are needed for our common priorities’ (European Commission 2023b). By contrast, the ECB has been confronted with the task of reconciling the economic growth policy objective and the low inflation one. The tension between these two policy objectives becomes visible when we consider some of the key decisions of the ECB Governing Council during 2021 and 2022. Since the launch of the euro, the ECB Governing Council and the ECB presidents have been very clear that the Bank's overriding policy objective is to keep eurozone inflation below, but close to, 2%. Thus, it was seen as a big departure from the status quo when the ECB announced in July 2021, after a review of its monetary policy strategy, that ‘it would tolerate inflation above the official target of 2 per cent if the jump seemed temporary’ (Ewing 2021). The ECB also said it would direct more pro-actively its bonds market purchases to mitigate climate change (ECB 2021, p. 55), thus establishing itself globally as one of the main proponents of central bank climate action in a relatively conservative global central banking community (see also Moschella 2023; Siderius 2022). For example, the ECB takes into account climate change when buying corporate bonds, one of the ECB's main tools to stimulate borrowing and economic growth, as part of its economic stimulus measures. Particularly, the ECB (2021) stated that it would favour companies that have made tangible steps to reduce their carbon footprints. At the same time, it is worth noting that the ECB Governing Council, the Bank's main decision-making body, has not been unanimous on how to strike a balance between the different policy objectives of the ECB. Some members of the ECB Governing Council are in favour of the ECB's new monetary strategy and approach. For example, Klaas Knot, President of the Dutch Central Bank, has been a vocal proponent of ECB climate action and taking a broader perspective when reconciling the different policy objectives, such as keeping inflation in check while fostering financial stability and economic growth in the Union (De Nederlandsche Bank 2023). François Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Bank of France, has expressed similar views, and Isabel Schnabel, member of the ECB Executive Board, has stressed that ‘the main reason central banks should increase their attention to climate change is the likelihood it will affect their ability to achieve their [core] mandates’ (Schnabel 2021). Other members of the ECB Governing Council have been more sceptical. For instance, Jens Weidmann, President of the German Bundesbank between 2011 and 2021 and a member of the ECB Governing Council, repeatedly called for the ECB to reconsider its stimulus spending before eurozone inflation gets out of control (Arnold and Chazan 2021). He also argued that climate change and climate action were outside the remit of central banks. Eventually, Weidmann stepped down in October 2021, three years before his second term as Bundesbank President was set to end, amid speculation that he found himself in the minority in the ECB Governing Council, consistently advocating tighter monetary policy to fight inflation and even criticizing the unconventional ECB policy toolkit designed to safeguard financial stability and the euro during the eurozone crisis (Arnold and Chazan 2021). Yet as inflation soared in the eurozone, reaching 22% in Estonia in June 2022, the ECB began to pivot from the economic growth policy objective to the low inflation one. In July 2022, the Governing Council raised the key ECB interest rates for the first time in more than a decade to 0.5%, putting an end to an era of negative policy rates (ECB 2022a). After July 2022, the ECB increased its fixed interest rate almost monthly, reaching 4% in June 2023, the highest eurozone interest rate since the 2007 global financial crisis. The ECB has moved to tighten monetary policy quickly since July 2022, raising interest rates and phasing out its asset purchases at an unprecedented pace, aiming to bring inflation back towards the 2% medium-term target (ECB 2022a). These actions brought the average eurozone inflation rate to 6% in June 2023, but clearly still above 2%. Also in July 2022, the ECB unveiled the so-called Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI), a tool to support the effective transmission of monetary policy. Subject to activation by the ECB Governing Council, the TPI can be used for secondary market purchases of securities issued by eurozone member states that experience ‘a deterioration in financing conditions not warranted by country-specific fundamentals, to counter risks to the [monetary policy] transmission mechanism’ (ECB 2022b). Here too, it is important to note that ‘TPI purchases would depend on the severity of the risks facing monetary policy transmission’ (ECB 2022b) and the amount of the purchases is not restricted ex ante, giving the ECB a lot of discretion in determining the scale of the intervention needed. ECB President Christine Lagarde clearly signalled a renewed emphasis on bringing down eurozone inflation in a speech in Estonia in November 2022. She acknowledged that some EU countries, such as the three Baltic states, experienced unprecedented inflation rates due to the combination of shocks, for example, Russia's war in Ukraine, hiked energy prices, disrupted supply chains and re-allocation of demand. Lagarde maintained that ‘central banks have to rely on their loyalty to their mandate to ensure price stability … We will therefore have to raise rates to levels that will deliver our 2% medium-term inflation target’ (ECB 2022c). A month later, in December 2022, the ECB Governing Council also pivoted to the low inflation policy objective by taking a decision to reduce the Bank's bond holdings and stressed that fiscal support for the eurozone economies would be ‘temporary, targeted and tailored’ (ECB 2022d). This article took stock of the most recent policies adopted in the 2020s by two key actors in European economic and financial sector governance – the European Commission and the ECB – to advance the green transition toward a carbon neutral EU economy by 2050. I argued that the new EU gouvernement économique of the 2020s can tap into larger financial means to support the green economy, supplementing the traditional EU budget with newly set-up supranational investment funds available through NGEU. Lastly, the prevailing mode of governance is polycentric and decentralized, where the Commission and the ECB act as ‘orchestrators’ to align the policies and actions of the member states and other EU bodies and reconcile different policy objectives, such as economic growth and low inflation. At a conference on the ‘Macroeconomic implications of climate action’, Pierre Wunsch, Governor of the National Bank of Belgium, emphasized that ‘as climate policy becomes an integral part of economic policy, it is crucial to secure broad public support’ (Wunsch 2023). Looking ahead, the success of the Commission and the ECB's ambitious policies to advance the green transition will depend on becoming sufficiently embedded in national economic policy and receiving backing by the EU citizens.

Our orbital analysis incorporates radial velocities, relative astrometry, and Hipparcos–Gaia astrometric accelerations. We constrain the main-sequence lifetime of a white dwarf’s progenitor from the remnant’s dynamical mass and semi-empirical initial–final mass relations and infer the cooling age from mass and effective temperature. We present new relative astrometry of HD 27483 B from Keck/NIRC2 observations and archival Hubble Space Telescope data, and obtain the first dynamical mass of ${0.798}_{-0.041}^{+0.10}$ M⊙, and an age of ${450}_{-180}^{+570}$ Myr, consistent with previous age estimates of Hyades. We also measure precise dynamical masses for HD 114174 B (0.591 ± 0.011 M⊙) and HD 169889 B (${0.526}_{-0.037}^{+0.039}$ M⊙), but their age precisions are limited by their uncertain temperatures. For HD 27786 B, the unusually small mass of 0.443 ± 0.012 M⊙ suggests a history of rapid mass-loss, possibly due to binary interaction in its progenitor’s asymtotic giant branch phase. The orbits of HD 118475 and HD 136138 from our radial velocity fitting are overall in good agreement with Gaia DR3 astrometric two-body solutions, despite moderate differences in the eccentricity and period of HD 136138. The mass of ${0.580}_{-0.039}^{+0.052}$ M⊙ for HD 118475 B and a speckle imaging non-detection confirms that the companion is a white dwarf.

Uranus also harbors five primary regular moons that play an important role in the distribution of material that surrounds the planet. Here we present the results of a dynamical simulation suite for the Uranian system, intended to explore the interaction between the five primary regular moons and particles within the system. We identify regions of extreme mass loss within 40 planetary radii of Uranus, including eccentricity excitation of particle orbits at resonance locations that can promote moonlet formation within the rings. We calculate a total dynamical particle mass-loss rate of 35% within 0.5 × 10 6 yr and 40% mass loss within 10 7 yr.

Repeated carbon isotope excursions and widespread organic-rich shale deposition mark the Middle and Late Devonian series. Various explanations such as extensive volcanism and land plant evolution have been given for these perturbations and the general sensitivity of the Devonian to oceanic anoxia, but their repeated nature suggests that astronomical forcing may have controlled their timing. Here, a cyclostratigraphic study of the Kellwasser Crisis at the Frasnian-Famennian stage boundary (ca. 372 Ma) is carried out. The Kellwasser Crisis was one of the most ecologically impactful of the Devonian perturbations and is ranked among the ‘Big Five’ Phanerozoic mass extinctions. The studied site is the Winsenberg Road Cut section in the Rhenish Massif, Germany, which represents a quiet tropical shelf basin setting. Centimetre-scale elemental records, generated by portable X-Ray scanning, allow for testing of the hypothesis that a 2.4 Myr eccentricity node preceded the Upper Kellwasser event. The study’s results are supportive of this hypothesis. We find enhanced chemical weathering (K2O/Al2O3) during the period leading up to the Upper Kellwasser, and a peak in distal detrital input (SiO2/CaO) and riverine runoff (TiO2/Al2O3) just prior to the start of the Upper Kellwasser. We interpret this pattern as the long-term eccentricity minimum facilitating excessive regolith build-up in the absence of strong seasonal contrasts. The Earth’s system coming out of this node would have rapidly intensified the hydrological cycle, causing these nutrient-rich regoliths to be eroded and washed away to the oceans where they resulted in eutrophication and anoxia. An astronomical control on regional climate is observed beyond this single crisis. Wet-dry cycles were paced by 405-kyr eccentricity, with both the Lower and Upper Kellwasser events taking place during comparatively drier times. A precessional-forced monsoonal climate system prevailed on shorter timescales. Intensification of this monsoonal system following the node may have caused the widespread regolith erosion. We estimate the total duration of the Kellwasser Crisis at ca. 900 kyr, with the individual events lasting for ca. 250 and 100 kyr, respectively. If astronomical control indeed operated via regolith build up in monsoonal climates, land plants may have played an important role. Not by certain evolutionary steps triggering specific perturbations, but by permanently strengthening the climatic response to orbital forcing via soil development – creating soils thick enough to meaningfully respond to orbital forcing – and intensifying the hydrological cycle.",en,2,37816223.02292784,19,"{'Geography': 111392, 'Chemistry': 30890, 'Environmental science': 187282, 'Business': 51597, 'Philosophy': 117978, 'Geology': 28117, 'Mathematics': 39461, 'Computer science': 62736, 'Political science': 75435, 'Economics': 46236, 'Engineering': 27822, 'Art': 75069, 'Psychology': 46376, 'Materials science': 35966, 'Sociology': 126408, 'History': 137379, 'Biology': 48432, 'Medicine': 25108, 'Physics': 11855}",1.0

Herein, Ru atoms in the Ru2P structure were replaced with M=Co, Ni, or Mo to produce M2-xRuxP nanocrystals. The metals show strong site preference, with Co and Ni occupying the tetrahedral sites and Ru the square pyramidal sites of the CoRuP and NiRuP Ru2P-type structures. The presence of Co or Ni in the tetrahedral sites leads to charge redistribution for Ru and, according to density functional theory (DFT) calculations, to a significant increase in the Ru d-band centers. As a result, the intrinsic activity of CoRuP and 1 NiRuP increases considerably compared to Ru2P in both acidic and alkaline media. The effect is not observed for MoRuP, in which Mo prefers to occupy the pyramidal sites. In particular, CoRuP shows state-of-the-art activity, outperforming Ru2P with Pt-like activity in 0.5 M H2SO4 (η10=12.3 mV; η100=52 mV; turnover frequency (TOF)=4.7 s-1).

Further increase of the Co content does not lead to drastic loss of activity, especially in alkaline medium, where for example the TOF of Co1.9Ru0.1P remains comparable to that of Ru2P and higher than Pt/C, highlighting the viability of the adopted approach to prepare cost efficient catalysts.",en,2,0.0,1,{'Materials science': 3838},0.0

Although effective treatments for it exist, early interventions that prevent PTSD from developing are lacking. The aim of this pilot analogue trauma study was to compare the effects of two potential early intervention strategies, namely Tetris_dualtask and imagery rescripting (IR) to a no-intervention control group on intrusion frequency and the vividness and emotionality of aversive film memory. Sixty healthy students were subjected to the trauma film paradigm and randomly allocated to either: Tetris_dualtask, IR or no-intervention. Main outcomes were the number of film-related intrusions at one week and vividness and emotionality ratings of the most aversive film memory. Secondary outcomes were PTSD-like symptoms, intrusion intensity, and explicit film memory. The Tetris_dualtask group reported significant fewer intrusions compared to the no-intervention group; whereas the IR group did not. No effect was found on vividness and emotionality ratings, PTSD-like symptoms, intrusion intensity, and explicit memory. The sample size was small, and analogue trauma in healthy individuals was examined, thus generalizability may be limited. Also, to increase comparability between interventions, the duration of Tetris_dualtask and IR was standardized. As a result, the IR intervention was shorter compared to other studies, which might have decreased its efficacy. The results of this pilot study suggest that playing Tetris during retrieval of traumatic images, might hold potential as an early intervention strategy to reduce intrusions in the early aftermath of trauma and adversity. However, future large-scale replication research is needed.",en,2,0.0,0,{},0.0

To test the effectiveness of diffusive exchange in igneous and metamorphic rocks, we have carried out an investigation of veins formed at low temperatures (&lt;100°C), comparing the oxygen isotopic composition of vein calcite with that of secondary calcite in the wallrocks. Two examples of veins from the Borrowdale Volcanic Group, Cumbria, and one from the Mountsorrel Granodiorite, Leicestershire, UK, have remarkably similar vein calcite compositions, ca. +20‰ (SMOW) or greater, substantially heavier than the probable compositions of the host rocks, and these vein calcite compositions are inferred to reflect the infiltrating fluid and the temperature of vein formation. Calcites from the wallrocks are similar to those in veins, with little evidence for exchange with the wallrocks. The results support existing models for this type of vein which suggest low-temperature growth from formation brines originally linked to Permian or Triassic evaporites. The results are consistent with flow through fractures being attenuated through a damage zone adjacent to the fracture and provide no evidence of diffusional exchange with pore waters from wallrocks.",en,2,8501594.368375473,19,"{'Geology': 185403, 'Chemistry': 27240, 'Geography': 45304, 'Environmental science': 87063, 'Economics': 14866, 'Materials science': 10519, 'History': 49151, 'Psychology': 18090, 'Philosophy': 21887, 'Engineering': 9962, 'Computer science': 8968, 'Biology': 4480, 'Mathematics': 7860, 'Sociology': 36929, 'Medicine': 4821, 'Art': 14534, 'Business': 10942, 'Political science': 16193, 'Physics': 3164}",1.0

The study identifies adaptive and transformative strategies and acts implemented in these scenarios to respond to rapidly changing circumstances. Consequently, this study is aimed at educators and administrators in design programmes, design researchers and the wider design and higher education (HE) communities. A descriptive multi-case study design was applied to describe several instances of a contemporary phenomenon within its natural environment. In these case studies, the authors present and reflect on their teaching experiences before, during and after the pandemic. The authors identify the following adaptive and transformative strategies and acts that contributed to creating resilient, sustainable and inclusive learning environments during the pandemic: (1) redesigning the curriculum as an emergent phenomenon; (2) adapting the project brief and adjusting learning expectations; (3) expanding the instructor’s role in the studio; (4) renegotiating the boundaries between students and instructors; (5) increasing awareness about students’ mental health and well-being; (6) adopting new tools, materials and techniques, and adapting the existing ones; (7) implementing new methods for communicating with the students. This article contributes to the existing discussions about the future of design education. The findings can help plan future design curricula that are adaptable, flexible and responsive to change. Such curricula can better address different student needs, whose educational experiences can have longer-lasting effects through their contributions to society upon graduation.

However, many authors argue that conventional statistical tests will reject the null of data “Benford-ness” if applied in samples of the typical size in this kind of applications, even in the presence of tiny and practically unimportant deviations from Benford’s law. Therefore, they suggest using alternative criteria that, however, lack solid statistical foundations. This paper contributes to the debate on the “large n” (or “excess power”) problem in the context of Benford’s law testing. This issue is discussed in relation with the notion of severity testing for goodness-of-fit tests, with a specific focus on tests for conformity with Benford’s law. To do so, we also derive the asymptotic distribution of the mean absolute deviation (MAD) statistic as well as an asymptotic standard normal test. Finally, the severity testing principle is applied to six controversial large datasets to assess their “Benford-ness”.",en,2,67631989.57807033,19,"{'Mathematics': 91350, 'Art': 142703, 'Environmental science': 216238, 'Geography': 196395, 'Political science': 146847, 'Sociology': 214519, 'History': 267618, 'Economics': 140713, 'Engineering': 50963, 'Computer science': 94218, 'Business': 159477, 'Philosophy': 176860, 'Biology': 64377, 'Medicine': 49379, 'Psychology': 94417, 'Physics': 15564, 'Geology': 16699, 'Materials science': 38500, 'Chemistry': 22537}",1.0

Changes in shoreline position are the result of coupled hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes happening in the nearshore and acting at different temporal scales. Due to this complexity, methodologies aimed at reproducing shoreline evolution at decadal time scale require many simplifications. Simpler methods usually consider an equilibrium beach profile whose shape depends only on beach morphology, and whose location varies depending on incoming forcing. Here, we derive a general equation for shoreline evolution using equilibrium beach profiles. We particularize it based on several common assumptions, and evaluate changes on shoreline position caused by sea-level rise, combined with simultaneous wave and high-frequency sea-level forcing. We compare our model against other analytical equilibrium beach profile-based models and with a dynamic model explicitly computing sediment transport. Results indicate that: (i) it is necessary to consider the area of the emerged beach subject to marine forcing rather than focusing only on the submerged part, (ii) the rates of shoreline recession may change for narrow beaches, defined as those for which marine forcings act onto all of their aerial surface, and (iii) Bruun’s Rule can describe beach shoreline evolution, but the uncertainty in selecting the landward boundary of the active profile entails a huge uncertainty in the magnitude of shoreline evolution. This problematic uncertainty can be drastically reduced if instantaneous forcing conditions are used instead of the arbitrary emerged/submerged active profile boundaries typically defined by only one statistic parameter of extreme conditions.",en,2,26875.381520434257,7,"{'Geology': 15025, 'Environmental science': 726, 'Physics': 19, 'Geography': 19, 'Economics': 17, 'Philosophy': 19, 'History': 19}",1.0

This study integrates 3D modeling, model space analysis, and association rule analysis to extract the relationship between structural deformation and gold mineralization. The Apriori algorithm with spatial constraints is used to quantify the favorable mineralization sites in the Jiaojia gold field using different combinations of ore-controlling indicators. The first favorable mineralization site has a 44% probability of mineralization and is primarily located in segments of the fault footwall within 25 m of the fault buffer where the transition from steep to gentle occurs (∼1–24). Its uniform distribution indicates that the ore-bearing space near the main fault plane is relatively wide, and hydrothermal diffusion is relatively uniform. Site No. 2 has a 45% probability of mineralization and is located in convex segments (6–35 m) between 25 and 55 m of the fault footwall. The equidistant zonal distribution in this area indicates that secondary faults and fractures have facilitated the migration of hydrothermal fluids, resulting in the formation of extensive ore-bearing spaces.

The Large-Sized Telescopes (LSTs) of CTA are the largest telescope type with a mirror dish of 23 m diameter. They cover the low energy end of the accessible gamma-ray energies for IACTs, starting from about 20 GeV up to a few TeV. The first LST prototype, known as LST-1, was officially inaugurated at the Observatorio del Roque de Los Muchachos in La Palma (Canary Islands, Spain) in 2018 and has since performed calibration observations of various known gamma-ray sources. Additionally, the site houses the MAGIC telescopes, two 17 m IACTs situated approximately 100 m away from LST-1, which have been performing stereo observations since 2009. Currently, joint observations between LST-1 and MAGIC are being carried on, and the data taken independently by the two IACT systems is analyzed by combining events via software. However, this method increases the energy threshold, as it discards all but the relatively high-energy events triggered by all three telescopes.

Specifically, 3D near net shape stoichiometric silicon carbide (SiC) objects are designed by manipulating the key features of a commercially available polycarbosilane (fusibility, high carbon content, relatively high SiC yield). In the early stage of the process, the carbon-rich polycarbosilane is first mixed with Si and SiC fillers and then thermolyzed at 120°C to increase polymer branching while offering tailored rheological properties during micro-extrusion and providing adequate shape retention once extruded. This allowed for the design of tailored and complex 3D complex polymer architectures with features down to 400 μm. The complex polymer parts are further converted into 3D stoichiometric SiC objects with quasi-near-net-shape - a volume shrinkage reduced to 9.1% has been measured - by heat-treatment at a temperature as low as 1400°C (argon flow). Given the flexibility to tune the preceramic polymer chemical and rheological properties, a new combined design approach is leveraged to generate bespoke advanced ceramics with a high freedom in geometry complexity.

In this study, we implemented a QM/MM framework on OPRT derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to obtain insights into the competitive binding of OA and OA-mimetic inhibitors by quantifying their interactions with OPRT. 4-Hydroxy-6-methylpyridin-2(1H) one showed the best inhibiting activity among the structurally similar OA-mimetic inhibitors, as quantified from the binding energetics. Our analysis of protein-ligand interactions unveiled the association of this inhibitory ligand with a strong network of hydrogen bonds, a large contribution of hydrophobic contacts, and bridging water molecules in the binding site.

To minimize the negative effects caused by this parasite, the pesticide amitraz is commonly used by beekeepers. Based on these, the objectives of this work are to determine the toxic effects caused by amitraz and its metabolites in HepG2 cells, as well as its determination in honey samples and the study of its stability with different heat treatments commonly used in the honey industry and its relationship with the amount of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) produced. Amitraz significantly decreased cell viability by MTT assay and total protein content (PC) assay, being more cytotoxic than its metabolites. Amitraz and its metabolites caused oxidative stress by Lipid Peroxidation (LPO) production and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) generation. Residues of amitraz and/or its metabolites were found in analyzed honey samples, with 2,4-Dimethylaniline (2,4-DMA) being the main metabolite confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-QTOF HRMS).

The aim of this study was to propose a solution for this problem by conducting annual tree-ring curve-fitting to determine a tree’s age-related dimension so that growth and increment can then be calculated smoothly. Sungkai (Peronema canescens), a luxurious commercial timber chosen as a case study, resulted in a satisfying growth curve following continuous models (Gompertz, Chapman–Richards, and von Bertalanffy) and discrete models (Bahtiar and Darwis exponential modification). The Chapman–Richards model gave the best-fit sigmoid growth curve. The first derivation (dN/dt) of the growth formula produces the current annual increment (CAI).

However, existing studies have few descriptions, and the research on the impact of growth environments and stand spatial structures on tree morphological structure and growth is still limited. In our study, we constructed a comprehensive grade model of spatial structure (CGMSS) to comprehensively evaluate individual tree growth states of the stands and grade them from 0 to 10 correspondingly. In addition, we developed a Chinese fir morphological structure growth model based on CGMSS, and dynamically simulate the growth variations of Chinese fir stands. The results showed that the overall stand prediction accuracy of CGMSS-based Chinese fir diameter at breast height, tree height, crown width and under-living branch height growth models was more than 94%. According to the analysis of the comprehensive grade of spatial structure (CGSS) of trees in the stand, except for the prediction accuracy and systematic error of the under-living branch height growth model at the CGSS = 3–5 levels, the systematic error of the Chinese fir growth model at each level was lower than 21.2%, and the prediction accuracy was greater than 73%. Compared with the spatial structural unit (SSU)-based Chinese fir growth model proposed by Ma et al., all growth models fit better at all levels, except for the CGMSS-based Chinese fir tree height and under-living branch height growth models that fit significantly lower than the SSU-based Chinese fir growth model at CGSS = 3–5 levels. In this study, the main conclusion is that the simulation results of CGMSS’s Chinese fir morphological structure growth model are closer to the real growth state of trees, achieving accurate simulation of differential growth of trees in different growth dominance degrees and spatial structure states in forest stands, making visualized forest management more effective and realistic.",en,2,108108.00429104907,15,"{'Mathematics': 13006, 'Political science': 735, 'Environmental science': 608, 'Philosophy': 607, 'Psychology': 657, 'Economics': 4354, 'Art': 89, 'Geology': 38, 'Business': 123, 'History': 263, 'Geography': 182, 'Sociology': 119, 'Computer science': 78, 'Physics': 17, 'Chemistry': 19}",1.0

The source of natural fibres should be sought in local plants, such as Spanish Broom in the Mediterranean area. The fibre treatment process was carried out in 8 different ways with alkali 4%, 5%, 6%, 8%, 10% and 15% NaOH solution, and 5% NaOH and 2% Na2SO3 mixture solution and seawater. The fibres were tested for tensile strength. No relationship was established between the concentration of the solution and the tensile strength of the fibres. The influence of the reuse of treatment solution on fibre quality was monitored by X-ray diffraction (XRD), ATR-FTIR, and TG/DTG analysis. Fibres with lengths of 1, 2, and 3 cm were added to cement mortar specimens in amounts of 0.5 and 1 vol%. The flexural and compressive strengths were tested on mortar specimens after 28 days. For fibres 1 and 3 cm long, 0.5% natural fibre content gives higher strength results: about 9% for flexural strength and 13.5% and 11.7% for compressive strength in regard to mortar reinforced with fibres of the same length but with a proportion of 1%. For mortar reinforced with fibre 2 cm long, better results are achieved with 1% fibre content, namely 9% higher flexural strength and 11.2% higher compressive strength compared to mortars with 0.5% fibre content. SEM/EDS analysis showed that the fibres are integrated into the cement matrix but that there is no strong interaction with the binder. For examination and 3D visualisation of mortar specimens, a medical device MSCT (Multi-slice Computed Tomography) was also used.

However, the design and manufacture of pressure vessels used to store dangerous liquids or pressurised fluids, such as LPG, has been a major cause of hazards, including explosions and leakage. In this study, we aim to address this issue by designing and analysing a vertical pressure vessel with a capacity of 10 m3 of pressurised LPG in accordance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) code. Safety is the primary concern in designing pressure vessels due to the potential risks posed by accidents. Therefore, the main objective of this project is to design a pressure vessel that is safe from failure. The vessel is cylindrical with two elliptical heads, two nozzles, a manway and four leg supports, and we used Autodesk Inventor Professional 2023 for geometric modelling and Inventor Nastran for FEA analysis. To investigate the displacements, deflections and Von-Mises stresses in the pressure vessel, we used the finite element method, and Autodesk Inventor Nastran was employed for the analysis. Our results showed that changes to the structure of the pressure vessel were needed to reduce stress in the structure. Specifically, the displacement showed an inverse relationship with the tank section shell thickness. Moreover, we observed that the factor of safety increased linearly with shell thickness. We carefully considered permissible pressures and determined the required wall thickness to ensure acceptable maximum stresses. Our results indicate that the design is safe from failure, and the highest stresses are experienced by the manway followed by the shell, while the heads, nozzles and legs support experienced the lowest stresses. We also performed a theoretical calculation for the entire model and checked the results to ensure they were within the acceptable limits. In summary, our study highlights the importance of designing pressure vessels in accordance with ASME codes to ensure safety and prevent hazards caused by improper design and manufacturing.

The unique properties of these composites are based on the attributes of the individual components, as well as the relative numbers and arrangements of those components within the material system. The widespread acceptance of composites reinforced with natural fibers has attracted many researchers due to its cost, sustainability, low environmental impact and great availability in nature. The processing of natural fibers is not difficult as compared to the production of conventional fibers. In the construction, aerospace, military, building, packaging, consumer products, and transportation industries for ceiling, paneling, partition boards, etc., natural fibers have shown to be a successful substitute for synthetic fiber. Because of these factors, natural fibers are preferred to conventional fibers. However, natural fiber reinforced composites also have some negative aspects such as increased susceptibility to water damage, less durability in the event of a fire, and diminished strength when they are subjected to mechanical stress.

The reverse leakage current at −8 V is 37% lower compared to that of the LEDs without an AlGaN interlayer, while other electronic properties are comparable. The large bandgap of AlGaN hinders the carrier transportation towards substrate.

For several decades, the normalized shear strength of clays has been the cornerstone of geotechnical design in many applications, such as staged construction of embankments. Recently, different trends of shear strength dependency on consolidation stresses have emerged indicating nonlinear variation. Resedimentation has been a useful and reliable method to investigate stress dependency by generating lab test specimens of fine-grained soils with a minimum sample to sample variation for benchmark studies. Previous work on resedimented Nile silty clay (RNSC) has shown unique features, such as high sand fraction and contradicting index properties used for soil classification.

Extensive tests were conducted on three varieties of dredged silt samples of varying heights from Qianwan, Shenzhen, China. The salient findings can be summarised as follows: (1) Compression curves for samples of different dimensions transitioned through three distinct phases: minimal load disturbance, elastic deformation, and plastic deformation. Notably, the void ratio during the latter two phases diminished as sample height increased. (2) A rising sample height corresponded to a reduced stable strain and compression index. Furthermore, the consolidation coefficient notably diminished with an escalation in the sample height, whereas the structural yield stress remained largely unaffected. (3) Given the disparate formation processes, stress histories, and material compositions between dredged and marine silts, the permeability coefficient of dredged silt was found to be superior to that of marine silt. Within the typical preloading pressure scope (50~300 kPa), the consolidation coefficient of dredged silt was lower compared to marine silt.

The showcased electro-hydraulic actuation architecture enables efficient four-quadrant operation and incorporates energy recovery capabilities. At the core of the system lies a distinctive electro-hydraulic unit, integrating a fixed hydraulic pump and a variable-speed electric motor into a compact and powerful entity. A specialized hydraulic system is designed to efficiently transform electrical energy from the electro-hydraulic unit into boom cylinder actuation. The sizing of the system is determined by the boom operation of a commercial compact loader. The maximum power output of the electro-hydraulic system is approximately 15 kW. The components of the proposed system are integrated into the reference vehicle, and comprehensive performance tests are conducted. The results of the tests performed on the vehicle with the boom lifting and lowering cycle indicate an overall system efficiency of 60%. The electrified solution consumes only about one-third of the energy used by the conventional boom actuation system on the reference machine, while exhibiting energy savings exceeding 75% during specific work phases.

Some tests have been conducted by tuning the saturation suction and exhaust temperatures of the compressor through adjustment of the cold source outlet temperature and the ambient temperature.

Therefore, the present study evaluated the spatial variability of chemical attributes of the soil under an agroforestry system compared to a native forest in the municipality of Tomé-açu, Eastern Amazon, Brazil. Soil samples were performed at 36 points arranged in a 55 x 55 m grid. The soils were prepared and submitted to analysis in order to determine pH in H2O, exchangeable calcium, magnesium, potassium and aluminium, available phosphorus, potential acidity, organic matter, bases saturation and aluminium saturation. For each soil attribute, the spherical, gaussian and exponential models were adjusted. After the semivariograms fitting, data interpolation for assessment of spatial variability of the variables was performed through ordinary kriging. The spherical and gaussian models were the most efficient models in estimation of soil attributes spatial variability, in most cases. Most of variables presented a regular spatial variability in their respective kriging maps, with some exceptions. In general, the kriging maps can be used, and we can take them as logistical maps for management and intervention practices in order to improve the soil fertility in the study areas.

The samples belong to the category of thin plate slags (PS-C, thickness < 0.5 cm) and the newly defined category of very thin plate slags (PS-D, thickness < 0.2 cm). From their chemical and phase composition, three groups could be distinguished. These different groups did not indicate separate stages during the working process but rather haphazard variations. The amount of residual Cu observed in all the plate slags was small (average Cu content 0.59 wt%), indicating an efficient process of copper smelting, comparable with other prehistoric copper production sites in the Eastern Alps.

Hence, a series of dynamic compression tests were carried out on EVA foams with different densities and thicknesses. When the impact energy is 66.64 J, for foam with a density of 150 kg/m3, the maximum contact force, maximum displacement, maximum strain, absorbed energy, and specific energy absorption (SEA) increased by 20 ± 2%, −38.5 ± 2%, −38.5 ± 2%, 4 ± 2%, and 105 ± 2%, respectively, compared to foam with a density of 70 kg/m3. The ratios of absorbed energy to impact energy for different thickness specimens are almost equal. The specimen density has no effect on the efficiency of energy absorption and has a greater effect on the SEA. Meanwhile, when the impact energy-to-thickness ratio is 1680 J/m, compared to foam with a thickness of 30 mm, the maximum contact force, maximum displacement, maximum strain, absorbed energy, and SEA for foam with a thickness of 60 mm increased by 28.5 ± 2%, 211.3 ± 2%, 56.6 ± 2%, 100.8 ± 2%, and 0.4 ± 0.5%, respectively.

At this time, in the process of processing bauxite, JSC ""Aluminium of Kazakhstan"" produces a large number of fines, which is of great interest to ferrous metallurgy. Wastes from alumina production include a variety of waste sludge, including red, gray sludge, and ferrous sands. According to the chemical composition, ferrous sands can be attributed to iron ore material with a high content of alumina. Most of these problems are eliminated by preliminary agglomeration of fines. In this work, agglomeration studies made it possible to establish the optimal parameters for sintering ferrous sands. When using 10% fuel, the best sintering performance is achieved. The optimal parameters for sintering ferrous sands mixed with other metallurgical wastes are such as productivity - 0.92 t / m2 h, mechanical strength - 80.0%, sintering speed - 19.3 mm/min, yield - 82.0%, the maximum temperature in the layer is 1340 °С.

Different compositions of AZ61, SiC, and ZrO 2 powder were taken into consideration and the progression of the FSC process were examined through properties of compressive strength, hardness, density, and porosity. For instance, the compressive yield strength of composition 85%Vol. of AZ61, 10%Vol. of ZrO 2 , and 5%Vol. of SiC accounts 164.2 MPa with an acceptable 2.2451 g/cm 3 and 0.593% density and porosity respectively. However, when the strength to weight ratio was taken into consideration, 95%Vol. of AZ61, 2.5%Vol. of ZrO 2 , and 2.5%Vol. of SiC composition attained highest strength to weight ratio value. Additionally, the compressive yield strength value increased directly proportional with the ZrO 2 volumetric composition. Likewise, the fractured surface of sample acquired highest strength to weight ratio was examined through SEM Fractography analysis.",en,2,39450560.885874376,19,"{'Materials science': 225896, 'Engineering': 37315, 'Business': 71001, 'Sociology': 160014, 'Chemistry': 33223, 'Art': 98504, 'Political science': 94025, 'History': 210536, 'Computer science': 82790, 'Environmental science': 140237, 'Psychology': 47322, 'Philosophy': 100792, 'Physics': 12213, 'Economics': 43035, 'Geology': 16805, 'Geography': 98491, 'Mathematics': 33180, 'Medicine': 12994, 'Biology': 8318}",1.0

One prominent example of such a connection, due to Bollob\'{a}s and Thomason and independently Koml\'os and Szemer\'edi, asserts that the average degree of $G$ being $d$ ensures a $K_{\Omega(\sqrt{d})}$-subdivision in $G$. Although this square-root bound is the best possible, various results showed that much larger clique subdivisions can be found in a graph for many natural classes. We investigate the connection between crux, a notion capturing the essential order of a graph, and the existence of large clique subdivisions. Our main result gives an asymptotically optimal bound on the size of a largest clique subdivision in a generic graph $G$, which is determined by both its average degree and its crux size. As corollaries, we obtain \begin{itemize} \item a characterisation of extremal graphs for which the square-root bound above is tight: they are essentially a disjoint union of graphs each of which has the crux size linear in $d$; \item a unifying approach to find a clique subdivision of almost optimal size in graphs which do not contain a fixed bipartite graph as a subgraph; \item and that the clique subdivision size in random graphs $G(n,p)$ witnesses a dichotomy: when $p = \omega(n^{-1/2})$, the barrier is the space, while when $p=o( n^{-1/2})$, the bottleneck is the density. \end{itemize}",en,2,4910059.628648595,19,"{'Mathematics': 56528, 'Computer science': 32627, 'Art': 14118, 'Materials science': 3698, 'Physics': 2205, 'Geography': 22210, 'Psychology': 9002, 'Sociology': 21706, 'Environmental science': 24696, 'History': 17579, 'Business': 10633, 'Engineering': 4614, 'Biology': 1517, 'Chemistry': 909, 'Philosophy': 12275, 'Economics': 3589, 'Medicine': 1424, 'Political science': 8853, 'Geology': 422}",1.0

Prior to 1980, volcano monitoring, multidisciplinary eruption forecasting, and interagency coordination for eruption response were new to the Cascade Range. A Mount St. Helens volcano hazards assessment had recently been published and volcanic crisis response capabilities tested during 1975 thermal unrest at nearby Mount Baker. Volcanic unrest began in March 1980, accelerating the rate of advance of volcano monitoring, prompting coordinated eruption forecasting and hazards communication, and motivating emergency response planning. The destruction caused by the 18 May 1980 eruption led to an enormous emergency response effort and prompted extensive coordination and planning for continuing eruptive activity. Eruptions continued with pulsatory dome growth and explosive eruptions over the following 6 years and with transport of sediment downstream over many more. In response, USGS scientists and their partners expanded their staffing, deployed new instruments, developed new tools (including the first use of a volcanic event tree) for eruption forecasting, and created new pathways for agency internal and external communication. Involvement in the Mount St. Helens response motivated the establishment of response measures at other Cascade Range volcanoes. Since assembly during the early and mid-1990s, volcano hazard working groups continue to unite scientists, emergency and land managers, tribal nations, and community leaders in common cause for the promotion of risk reduction. By the onset of renewed volcanic activity in 2004, these new systems enabled a more efficient response that was greatly facilitated by the participation of organizations within volcano hazard working groups. Although the magnitude of the 2004 eruptive sequence was much smaller than that of 1980, a new challenge emerged focused on hazard communication demands. Since 2008, our understanding of Mount St. Helens volcanic system has improved, helping us refine hazard assessments and eruption forecasts. Some professions have worked independently to apply the Mount St. Helens story to their products and services. Planning meetings and working group activities fortify partnerships among information disseminators, policy and decision-makers, scientists, and communities. We call the sum of these pieces the Volcanic Risk Management System (VRMS). In its most robust form, the VRMS encompasses effective production and coordinated exchange of volcano hazards and risk information among all interested parties.",en,2,29294.518465987945,7,"{'Geology': 16387, 'Environmental science': 777, 'Physics': 19, 'Geography': 38, 'Economics': 17, 'Philosophy': 19, 'History': 19}",1.0

The spare but evocative text then outlines the efforts of Black people to create spaces for themselves in a country where freedom was held out of their reach: ""Before [End Page 19] long, they had created Black America—a Black consciousness and Black institutions, where they could live, do, create, produce, inspire, and soar."" A timeline giving further detail is somewhat shoehorned into the middle of the main text, but it does serve to connect the past with the future, punctuated with a rallying cry to remember the people who established these foundations of Black culture, including jazz and rap, Black-owned businesses, and the BLM movement. Lewis' watercolor and gouache illustrations cast mostly faceless figures washed over with painterly strokes of white and gray to begin the book, clarifying forms and adding color as the book progresses. These eventually culminate in a celebratory but haunting picture of smiling school children with a ghostly figure of an enslaved child standing within the group.

In some industrial applications, only a limited level of tool wear is allowed to attain necessary tolerances. It may become challenging to monitor a limited level of tool wear in the data collected from the machine due to the other components, such as the flexible vibrations of the machine, dominating the measurement signals. In this study, a tool wear monitoring technique to predict limited levels of tool wear from the spindle motor current and dynamometer measurements is presented. High-frequency spindle motor current data is collected with an industrial edge device while the cutting forces and torque are measured with a rotary dynamometer in drilling tests for a selected number of holes. Feature engineering is conducted to identify the statistical features of the measurement signals that are most sensitive to small changes in tool wear. A neural network based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture is developed to predict tool flank wear from the measured spindle motor current and dynamometer signals. It is demonstrated that the proposed technique predicts tool flank wear with good accuracy and high computational efficiency. The proposed technique can easily be implemented in an industrial edge device as a real-time predictive maintenance application to minimize the costs due to manufacturing downtime and tool underuse or overuse.",en,2,44776028.775634974,19,"{'Business': 90172, 'Art': 112748, 'Psychology': 84817, 'Geography': 123525, 'Sociology': 205740, 'History': 207742, 'Political science': 128773, 'Philosophy': 140702, 'Engineering': 50037, 'Materials science': 46004, 'Physics': 10000, 'Environmental science': 198852, 'Medicine': 21534, 'Mathematics': 35100, 'Economics': 62925, 'Chemistry': 11585, 'Computer science': 92139, 'Geology': 20367, 'Biology': 9769}",1.0

In summer, the ice sheet albedo plays a leading role in wind fields at mid-to-high latitudes of Northern Hemisphere by causing a zonal wave-like response of temperature. While in winter, the ice sheet topography dominates the wind fields across North America to North Atlantic by inducing a northwest-southeast orientated tripole temperature response in this region.

The analysis concludes that the regional structure is located in the northern part of the Changling Depression in the central depressional area of the southern part of the Songliao Basin, where faults are developed. The three sedimentary microphases of the Qingshankou Formation include six microphases: submerged divergent channel, estuarine dam, submerged divergent channel flank, submerged divergent interbay, distant sand dam, and matted sand. Combining the sedimentary micro-phase map of the small layer time unit with the oil formation sandstone thickness map, sand-to-ground ratio map and effective thickness map of the oil formation, the oil and water distribution in the study area is correctly understood to guide the next development of the Qian'an oil field [3-4] .",en,2,0.0,0,{},0.0

Plain tungsten carbide WC tool inserts were exposed to microwave treatment for enhancement of their performance characteristics. It was found that a 20-min microwave treatment resulted in the best tool hardness and metallurgical characteristics. These tool inserts have been used to machine SS 316 material following the Taguchi L9 design of experimental techniques. A total of eighteen experiments have been conducted by varying three main machining parameters, i.e., cutting speed, feed rate, and depth of cut, at three levels per parameter. It has been found that tool flank wear increased with all three parameters and surface roughness decreased. At the longest dept of cut, surface roughness increased. An abrasion wear mechanism was found on the tool flank face at a high machining speed and adhesion at low speed. Chips with a helical shape and low serrations have been investigated. Turning SS 316 at optimum machining parameters of 170 m/min cutting speed, 0.2 mm/rev feed rate, and 1 mm depth of cut, as obtained by the multiperformance optimization technique grey relational analysis, resulted in the best values of all machinability indicators: 242.21 µm tool flank wear, 3.81 µm mean roughness depth, and 34,000 mm3/min material removal rate, at a single parameter setting. In terms of research achievements, the percentage reduction in surface roughness is approximately 30% and represents an almost ten-fold improvement in the material removal rate. The combination of machining parameters of 70 m/min cutting speed, 0.1 mm/rev feed rate, and 0.5 mm depth of cut is optimum for the lowest value of tool flank wear when considered for single parameter optimization.",en,2,25965172.19326769,19,"{'Engineering': 20641, 'Political science': 94431, 'Materials science': 109679, 'Business': 51999, 'Mathematics': 21049, 'Environmental science': 83125, 'Geography': 67552, 'History': 130784, 'Physics': 11514, 'Sociology': 121304, 'Philosophy': 67608, 'Computer science': 38566, 'Art': 45284, 'Economics': 31626, 'Chemistry': 11889, 'Biology': 11101, 'Medicine': 11175, 'Psychology': 33924, 'Geology': 9528}",1.0

However, studies on the geometric structure of sialon ceramic solid end mill is lacking at the present. In this work, the geometric structure of sialon ceramic end mills was designed for difficult-to-machine nickel-based superalloy materials. The cutting force and heat, flank wear and machined surface quality were analyzed to study the effect of the main parameters on tool performance. The results showed that the end mill experienced severe flank wear and chipping, which were the leading cause of its failure during high-speed cutting. The cutting force and temperature decreased gradually with the increase in the helix angle. With the increase in the rake angle, the flank wear and the quality of the machined surface of the specimen first decreased and then increased. With the increase in the relief angle, the cutting temperature of the ceramic end mill gradually decreased, and the cutting force and the machined surface roughness showed an initial decrease and then increased. When the helix angle, rake angle and relief angle were 35°, −15° and 12°, respectively, the sialon ceramic end mill exhibited the best cutting performance and obtained better machined surface quality in the nickel-based superalloys.",en,2,1403149.611942313,19,"{'Materials science': 80575, 'Engineering': 4862, 'Political science': 16299, 'Business': 4544, 'Mathematics': 1303, 'Environmental science': 5153, 'Geography': 5336, 'History': 11431, 'Physics': 749, 'Sociology': 11078, 'Philosophy': 4648, 'Computer science': 2944, 'Art': 3028, 'Economics': 1716, 'Chemistry': 2049, 'Biology': 740, 'Medicine': 778, 'Psychology': 2231, 'Geology': 734}",1.0

Dramatists she influenced, actors she directed in her plays, students she mentored in her playwriting workshops, as well as academics who taught and published essays and books on her diverse output – over 40 plays in her 40-year career – share Tony Kushner’s assessment that ‘‘America has produced no dramatist of greater importance’. Born in Havana, Cuba in 1930, Fornes came to New York in 1945, and by the early 1960s, she was a central force in the establishment of the Off-Off Broadway avant-garde movement in Greenwich Village. In 1953 she saw the original production of En attendant Godot in Paris and was inspired to become a playwright. Over the years, critics have cited Beckett’s impact on Fornes; however, this is the first essay to provide a detailed study of the specific ways Beckett’s plays influenced Fornes' dramas, particularly Tango Palace, Dr. Kheal, Fefu and her Friends, and Mud. Following Beckett, she jettisoned cohesive plots, traditional themes, outworn theatrical tropes, predictable endings, familiar settings, and identifiable characters declaiming to audiences where a play is heading and why. Most importantly, Beckett illustrated that different theatre forms were possible. This essay illustrates how Fornes, inspired by, but not imitating Beckett, made her own assault on conventional drama, The essay is also the first to delineate the ways in which Fornes' first play, Tango Palace, derives from her three-year love affair with Susan Sontag.",en,2,0.0,0,{},0.0
