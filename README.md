This study introduces a novel approach to measuring interdisciplinarity using keyword extraction and graph-based analysis. Keywords, extracted via KeyBERT, are mapped onto a Discipline Knowledge Graph as nodes, where interdisciplinarity scores are computed by using the BFS algorithm. Evaluation with a classification task using the SPECTER model reveals that zero-score papers encounter fewer fields, while interdisciplinary papers show lower classifier confidence, highlighting their complex, boundary-spanning nature. This method offers a content-driven perspective on interdisciplinarity, addressing limitations of journal-based analyses.
