Most human snoRNAs are embedded within host gene introns, the remainder being independently expressed from intergenic regions. We recently characterized the abundance of snoRNAs and their host gene across several healthy human tissues and found that the level of most snoRNAs does not correlate with that of their host gene, with the observation that snoRNAs embedded within the same host gene often differ drastically in abundance. To better understand the determinants of snoRNA expression, we trained machine learning models to predict whether snoRNAs are expressed or not in human tissues based on more than 30 collected features related to snoRNAs and their genomic context. By interpreting the models' predictions, we find that snoRNAs rely on conserved motifs, a stable global structure and terminal stem, and a transcribed locus to be expressed. We observe that these features explain well the varying abundance of snoRNAs embedded within the same host gene. By predicting the expression status of snoRNAs across several vertebrates, we notice that only one-third of all annotated snoRNAs are expressed per genome, as in humans. Our results suggest that ancestral snoRNAs disseminated within vertebrate genomes, sometimes leading to the development of new functions and a probable gain in fitness and thereby conserving features favorable to the expression of these few snoRNAs, the large remainder often degenerating into pseudogenes.",en
https://openalex.org/W4382132930,2023,Biology,"The diverse structural modes of tRNA binding and recognitionTransfer RNAs (tRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs responsible for decoding mRNA codon triplets, delivering correct amino acids to the ribosome, and mediating polypeptide chain formation. Due to their key roles during translation, tRNAs have a highly conserved shape and large sets of tRNAs are present in all living organisms. Regardless of sequence variability, all tRNAs fold into a relatively rigid three-dimensional L-shaped structure. The conserved tertiary organization of canonical tRNA arises through the formation of two orthogonal helices, consisting of the acceptor and anticodon domains. Both elements fold independently to stabilize the overall structure of tRNAs through intramolecular interactions between the D- and T-arm. During tRNA maturation, different modifying enzymes post-transcriptionally attach chemical groups to specific nucleotides, which not only affect translation elongation rates but also restrict local folding processes and confer local flexibility when required. The characteristic structural features of tRNAs are also employed by various maturation factors and modification enzymes to assure the selection, recognition and positioning of specific sites within the substrate tRNAs. The cellular functional repertoire of tRNAs continues to extend well beyond their role in translation, partly, due to the expanding pool of tRNA-derived fragments. Here, we aim to summarize the most recent developments in the field to understand how three-dimensional structure affects the canonical and non-canonical functions of tRNA.",en
https://openalex.org/W4366091955,2023,Biology,"EOGT Enables Residual Notch Signaling in Mouse Intestinal Cells Lacking POFUT1Abstract Notch signaling determines cell fates in mouse intestine. Notch receptors contain multiple epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats modified by O-glycans that regulate Notch signaling. Conditional deletion of protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 ( Pofut1 ) substantially reduces Notch signaling and markedly perturbs lineage development in mouse intestine. However, mice with inactivated Pofut1 are viable, whereas complete elimination of Notch signaling in intestine is lethal. Here we investigate whether residual Notch signaling enabled by EOGT permits mice lacking Pofut1 in intestine to survive. Mice globally lacking Eogt alone were grossly unaffected in intestinal development. In contrast, mice lacking both Eogt and Pofut1 died at ∼28 days after birth with greater loss of body weight, a greater increase in the numbers of goblet and Paneth cells, and greater downregulation of Notch target genes, compared to Pofut1 deletion alone. These data establish that both O-fucose and O-GlcNAc glycans are fundamental to Notch signaling in the intestine and provide new insights into roles for O-glycans in regulating Notch ligand binding. Finally, EOGT and O-GlcNAc glycans provide residual Notch signaling and support viability in mice lacking Pofut1 in the intestine.",en

https://openalex.org/W4367050237,2023,Biology,"Non-coding RNAs identification and regulatory networks in pathogen-host interaction in the microsporidia congenital infectionAbstract Background： The interaction networks between coding and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) including long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), covalently closed circular RNA (circRNA) and miRNA are significant to elucidate molecular processes of biological activities and interactions between host and pathogen. Congenital infection caused by vertical transmission of microsporidia N. bombycis can result in severe economic losses in the silkworm-feeding industry. However, little is known that about ncRNAs that take place in the microsporidia congenital infection. Here we conducted whole-transcriptome RNA-Seq analyses to identify ncRNAs and regulatory networks for both N. bombycis and host including silkworm embryos and larvae during the microsporidia congenital infection. Results: A total of 4,171 mRNAs, 403 lncRNA, 62 circRNAs, and 284 miRNAs encoded by N. bombycis were identified, among which some differentially expressed genes formed cross-talk and are involved in N. bombycis proliferation and infection. For instance, a lncRNA/circRNA competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network including 18 lncRNAs, one circRNA, and 20 miRNAs was constructed to describe 14 key parasites genes regulation, such as polar tube protein 3 ( PTP3 ), ricin-B-lectin, spore wall protein 4 ( SWP4 ), and heat shock protein 90 ( HSP90 ). Regarding silkworm host upon N. bombycis congenital infection, a total of 14,889 mRNAs, 3,038 lncRNAs, 19,039 circRNAs, and 3,413 miRNAs were predicted based on silkworm genome with many differentially expressed coding and non-coding genes during distinct developmental stages. Different species of RNAs form interacting network to modulate silkworm biological processes, such as growth, metamorphosis and immune responses.Furthermore, a lncRNA/circRNA ceRNA network consisting of 140 lncRNAs, five circRNA, and seven miRNAs are constructed hypothetically to describe eight key host genes regulation, such as Toll-6 , Serpin-6 , inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) and Caspase-8 . Notably, cross-species analyses indicate that parasite and host miRNAs play a vital role in pathogen-host interaction in the microsporidia congenital infection. Conclusion: This is the first comprehensive pan-transcriptome study inclusive of both N. bombycis and its host silkworm with a specific focus on microsporidia congenital infection, and show that ncRNA-mediated regulation plays a vital role in the microsporidia congenital infection, which provides a new insight into understanding the basic biology of microsporidia and pathogen-host interaction.",en

Integrative analyses of genotype and blood DNAm can address this gap and can help us characterize the biological function of PD genetic risk loci. First, we tested for associations between a PD genetic risk score (GRS) and DNAm. Our GRS included 36 independent genome-wide significant variants from the largest GWAS of PD to date. Our discovery sample was TERRE, consisting of French agricultural workers (71 PD cases and 147 controls). The GRS associated with DNAm at 85 CpG sites, with 19 associations replicated in an independent sample (DIG-PD). The majority of CpG sites (73) are within a 1.5 Mb window on chromosome 17, and 36 CpG sites annotate to MAPT and KANSL1 , neighboring genes that affect neurodegeneration. All associations were invariant to non-genetic factors, including exposure to commercial-grade pesticides, and omitting chromosome 17 variants from the GRS had little effect on association. Second, we compared our findings to the relationship between individual PD risk loci and blood DNAm using blood mQTL from a large independent meta-analysis (GoDMC). We found 79 CpG sites that colocalized with PD loci, and via summary Mendelian randomization analysis, we show 25/79 CpG sites where DNAm causally affects PD risk. The nine largest causal effects are within chromosome 17, including an effect within MAPT . Thus, all integrative analyses prioritized DNAm on chromosome 17, drawing from multiple independent data sets, meriting further study of this region.",en

These isoforms can be used to map mRNA stabilizing and destabilizing elements within 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs). Here, we examine how environmental conditions affect 3' mRNA isoform turnover and structure in yeast cells on a transcriptome scale. Isoform stability broadly increases when cells grow more slowly, with relative half-lives of most isoforms being well correlated across multiple conditions. Surprisingly, dimethyl sulfate probing reveals that individual 3' isoforms have similar structures across different conditions, in contrast to the extensive structural differences that can exist between closely related isoforms in an individual condition. Unexpectedly, most mRNA stabilizing and destabilizing elements function only in a single growth condition. The genes associated with some classes of condition-specific stability elements are enriched for different functional categories, suggesting that regulated mRNA stability might contribute to adaptation to different growth environments. Condition-specific stability elements do not result in corresponding condition-specific changes in steady-state mRNA isoform levels. This observation is consistent with a compensatory mechanism between polyadenylation and stability, and it suggests that condition-specific mRNA stability elements might largely reflect condition-specific regulation of mRNA 3' end formation.",en

As a specialized seed-bearing organ, fruit utilize cuticles as physical barriers, water permeation regulator and resistance to pathogens, thus appealing extensive research interests for its potential values in developing postharvest freshness-keeping strategies. Here, we provide an overview for the composition and functions of fruit cuticles, mainly focusing on its functions in mechanical support, water permeability barrier and protection over pathogens, further introduce key mechanisms implicated in fruit cuticle biosynthesis. Moreover, currently available state-of-art techniques for examining compositional diversity and architecture of fruit are also compared.",en
https://openalex.org/W4385188555,2023,Biology,"A new type of phasin characterized by the presence of a helix‐hairpin‐helix domain is required for normal polyhydroxybutyrate accumulation and granule organization in <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i>Bacteria frequently store excess carbon in hydrophobic granules of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) that in some growth conditions can occupy most of the cytoplasmic space. Different types of proteins associate to the surface of the granules, mainly enzymes involved in the synthesis and utilization of the reserve polymer and a diverse group of proteins known as phasins. Phasins have different functions, among which are regulating the size and number of the granules, modulating the activity of the granule-associated enzymes and helping in the distribution of the granules inside the cell. Caulobacter crescentus is an oligotrophic bacterium that shows several morphological and regulatory traits that allow it to grow in very nutrient-diluted environments. Under these conditions, storage compounds should be particularly relevant for survival. In this work, we show an initial proteomic characterization of the PHB granules and describe a new type of phasin (PhaH) characterized by the presence of an N-terminal hydrophobic helix followed by a helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) domain. The hydrophobic helix is required for maximal PHB accumulation and maintenance during the stationary phase while the HhH domain is involved in determining the size of the PHB granules and their distribution in the cell.",en
https://openalex.org/W4319162031,2023,Biology,"Spermidine Is The Main Polyamine Required By Intracellular Parasites For Survival Within Host ErythrocytesAbstract Intracellular eukaryotic pathogens such as Babesia and Plasmodium , the agents of human babesiosis and malaria, require salvage or de novo synthesis of several nutrients for survival in human erythrocytes. One such nutrient is putrescine, which is either transported from the host or synthesized from ornithine and serves as a precursor for the biosynthesis of two other polyamines: spermidine and spermine. However, the specific polyamines required by these parasites for survival and the molecular process they control remain unknown. We show in both B. duncani and P. falciparum that spermidine is the main product of the polyamine biosynthesis machinery required for parasite survival. Simultaneous inhibition of spermidine synthesis from putrescine and catabolism from spermine results in cell death and parasite survival can only be rescued by spermidine. Finally, we demonstrate that spermidine’s essential function in these parasites is through regulation of protein translation via hypusination of the translation initiation factor eIF5A.",en
https://openalex.org/W4379508709,2023,Biology,"Temporal dynamics of soil fungi in a pyrodiverse dry‐sclerophyll forestFire is a major evolutionary and ecological driver that shapes biodiversity in forests. While above-ground community responses to fire have been well-documented, those below-ground are much less understood. However, below-ground communities, including fungi, play key roles in forests and facilitate the recovery of other organisms after fire. Here, we used internal transcribed spacer (ITS) meta-barcoding data from forests with three different times since fire [short (3 years), medium (13-19 years) and long (>26 years)] to characterize the temporal responses of soil fungal communities across functional groups, ectomycorrhizal exploration strategies and inter-guild associations. Our findings indicate that fire effects on fungal communities are strongest in the short to medium term, with clear distinctions between communities in forests with a short time (3 years) since fire, a medium time (13-19 years) and a long time (>26 years) since fire. Ectomycorrhizal fungi were disproportionately impacted by fire relative to saprotrophs, but the direction of the response varied depending on morphological structures and exploration strategies. For instance, short-distance ectomycorrhizal fungi increased with recent fire, while medium-distance (fringe) ectomycorrhizal fungi decreased. Further, we detected strong, negative inter-guild associations between ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi but only at medium and long times since fire. Given the functional significance of fungi, the temporal changes in fungal composition, inter-guild associations and functional groups after fire demonstrated in our study may have functional implications that require adaptive management to curtail.",en

While ample quantitative studies have shown that 6-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one (6PP) possesses antifungal activities against multiple plant pathogenic fungi, the regulatory mechanisms of 6PP-mediated inhibition of fungal pathogenesis and growth are still unknown. Here, we investigated the potential molecular targets of 6PP in the phytopathogenic oomycetes P. litchii through integrated deployment of RNA-sequencing, functional genetics, and biochemical techniques to investigate the regulatory effects of 6PP against P. litchii. Previously we demonstrated that 6PP exerted significant oomyticidal activities. Also, comparative transcriptomic evaluation of P. litchii strains treated with 6PP Revealed significant up-regulations in the expression profile of TOR pathway-related genes, including PlCytochrome C and the transcription factors PlYY1. We also noticed that 6PP treatment down-regulated putative negative regulatory genes of the TOR pathway, including PlSpm1 and PlrhoH12 in P. litchii. Protein-ligand binding analyses revealed stable affinities between PlYY1, PlCytochrome C, PlSpm1, PlrhoH12 proteins, and the 6PP ligand. Phenotypic characterization of PlYY1 targeted gene deletion strains generated in this study using CRISPR/Cas9 and homologous recombination strategies significantly reduced the vegetative growth, sporangium, encystment, zoospore release, and pathogenicity of P. litchii. These findings suggest that 6PP-mediated activation of PlYY1 expression positively regulates TOR-related responses and significantly influences vegetative growth and the virulence of P. litchii. The current investigations revealed novel targets for 6PP and underscored the potential of deploying 6PP in developing management strategies for controlling the litchi downy blight pathogen.",en
https://openalex.org/W4323929114,2023,Biology,"Hedgehog pathway orchestrates the interplay of histone modifications and tailors combination epigenetic therapies in breast cancerEpigenetic therapies that cause genome-wide epigenetic alterations, could trigger local interplay between different histone marks, leading to a switch of transcriptional outcome and therapeutic responses of epigenetic treatment. However, in human cancers with diverse oncogenic activation, how oncogenic pathways cooperate with epigenetic modifiers to regulate the histone mark interplay is poorly understood. We herein discover that the hedgehog (Hh) pathway reprograms the histone methylation landscape in breast cancer, especially in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). This facilitates the histone acetylation caused by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and gives rise to new therapeutic vulnerability of combination therapies. Specifically, overexpression of zinc finger protein of the cerebellum 1 (ZIC1) in breast cancer promotes Hh activation, facilitating the switch of H3K27 methylation (H3K27me) to acetylation (H3K27ac). The mutually exclusive relationship of H3K27me and H3K27ac allows their functional interplay at oncogenic gene locus and switches therapeutic outcomes. Using multiple in vivo breast cancer models including patient-derived TNBC xenograft, we show that Hh signaling-orchestrated H3K27me and H3K27ac interplay tailors combination epigenetic drugs in treating breast cancer. Together, this study reveals the new role of Hh signaling-regulated histone modifications interplay in responding to HDAC inhibitors and suggests new epigenetically-targeted therapeutic solutions for treating TNBC.",en

Since soil function and structure depend mainly on the state of the biological communities, the soil quality assessment and disturbance in annual vs. perennial cropping systems is done with the help of indicators such as nematodes. Agricultural practices like mix cropping causes variations in the taxonomic abundance of soil nematode communities. This field experiment aimed to assess the overall effect of annual and perennial energy crops (maize: Zea mays and sainfoin: Onobrychis viciifolia) on the nematode communities under pure and mixed cultivation. Sainfoin had the highest nematode abundance, followed by the mixed culture and maize. Out of 38 identified genera, 19 were identified under maize, 31 under perennial sainfoin, 28 under annual sainfoin, 28 under perennial mixture, 20 under the annual mixture and 13 co-existed among these treatments. Of all the trophic groups, the bacterivores were the most abundant (738), followed by plant-parasitic nematodes (272), omnivores (230), fungivores (84), and carnivores (33). Nematode abundance was lower under the annual than perennial plots of both sainfoin and the mixed culture. The perennial plots were dominated by plant-parasitic nematodes. Our results support the idea that soil nematodes should be considered for inclusion in indices of soil quality through their contribution to soil processes. Also, soil nematodes and energy crops like sainfoin may increase the functional properties of agricultural ecosystems and allow better productivity and sustainability.",en

https://openalex.org/W4386209166,2023,Biology,"DONSON facilitates Cdc45 and GINS chromatin association and is essential for DNA replication initiationFaithful cell division is the basis for the propagation of life and DNA replication must be precisely regulated. DNA replication stress is a prominent endogenous source of genome instability that not only leads to ageing, but also neuropathology and cancer development in humans. Specifically, the issues of how vertebrate cells select and activate origins of replication are of importance as, for example, insufficient origin firing leads to genomic instability and mutations in replication initiation factors lead to the rare human disease Meier-Gorlin syndrome. The mechanism of origin activation has been well characterised and reconstituted in yeast, however, an equal understanding of this process in higher eukaryotes is lacking. The firing of replication origins is driven by S-phase kinases (CDKs and DDK) and results in the activation of the replicative helicase and generation of two bi-directional replication forks. Our data, generated from cell-free Xenopus laevis egg extracts, show that DONSON is required for assembly of the active replicative helicase (CMG complex) at origins during replication initiation. DONSON has previously been shown to be essential during DNA replication, both in human cells and in Drosophila, but the mechanism of DONSON's action was unknown. Here we show that DONSON's presence is essential for replication initiation as it is required for Cdc45 and GINS association with Mcm2-7 complexes and helicase activation. To fulfil this role, DONSON interacts with the initiation factor, TopBP1, in a CDK-dependent manner. Following its initiation role, DONSON also forms a part of the replisome during the elongation stage of DNA replication. Mutations in DONSON have recently been shown to lead to the Meier-Gorlin syndrome; this novel replication initiation role of DONSON therefore provides the explanation for the phenotypes caused by DONSON mutations in patients.",en

Here we show that arginine-derived polyketides (arginoketides) produced by Streptomyces species mediate cross-kingdom microbial interactions with fungi of the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium, and trigger the production of natural products. Arginoketides can be cyclic or linear, and a prominent example is azalomycin F produced by Streptomyces iranensis, which induces the cryptic orsellinic acid gene cluster in Aspergillus nidulans. Bacteria that synthesize arginoketides and fungi that decode and respond to this signal were co-isolated from the same soil sample. Genome analyses and a literature search indicate that arginoketide producers are found worldwide. Because, in addition to their direct impact, arginoketides induce a secondary wave of fungal natural products, they probably contribute to the wider structure and functioning of entire soil microbial communities.",en

https://openalex.org/W4304099273,2023,Biology,"Regulations of myo-inositol homeostasis: Mechanisms, implications, and perspectivesPhosphorylation is the most common module of cellular signalling pathways. The dynamic nature of phosphorylation, which is conferred by the balancing acts of kinases and phosphatases, allows this modification to finely control crucial cellular events such as growth, differentiation, and cell cycle progression. Although most research to date has focussed on protein phosphorylation, non-protein phosphorylation substrates also play vital roles in signal transduction. The most well-established substrate of non-protein phosphorylation is inositol, whose phosphorylation generates many important signalling molecules such as the second messenger IP3, a key factor in calcium signalling. A fundamental question to our understanding of inositol phosphorylation is how the levels of cellular inositol are controlled. While the availability of protein phosphorylation substrates is known to be readily controlled at the levels of transcription, translation, and/or protein degradation, the regulatory mechanisms that control the uptake, synthesis, and removal of inositol are underexplored. Potentially, such mechanisms serve as an important layer of regulation of cellular signal transduction pathways. There are two ways in which mammalian cells acquire inositol. The historic use of radioactive 3H-myo-inositol revealed that inositol is promptly imported from the extracellular environment by three specific symporters SMIT1/2, and HMIT, coupling sodium or proton entry, respectively. Inositol can also be synthesized de novo from glucose-6P, thanks to the enzymatic activity of ISYNA1. Intriguingly, emerging evidence suggests that in mammalian cells, de novo myo-inositol synthesis occurs irrespective of inositol availability in the environment, prompting the question of whether the two sources of inositol go through independent metabolic pathways, thus serving distinct functions. Furthermore, the metabolic stability of myo-inositol, coupled with the uptake and endogenous synthesis, determines that there must be exit pathways to remove this extraordinary sugar from the cells to maintain its homeostasis. This essay aims to review our current knowledge of myo-inositol homeostatic metabolism, since they are critical to the signalling events played by its phosphorylated forms.",en

Here we used phenotypic and molecular profiling, including epigenetic analyses, to investigate how ENKTL ontogeny relates to normal NK-cell development. We demonstrate that neoplastic NK cells are stably, but reversibly, arrested at earlier stages of NK-cell maturation. Genes downregulated in the most epigenetic immature tumors were associated with polycomb silencing along with genomic gain and overexpression of EZH2. ENKTL cells exhibited genome-wide DNA hypermethylation. Tumor-specific DNA methylation gains were associated with polycomb-marked regions, involving extensive gene silencing and loss of transcription factor binding. To investigate therapeutic targeting, we treated novel patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of ENKTL with the DNA hypomethylating agent, 5-azacytidine. Treatment led to reexpression of NK-cell developmental genes, phenotypic NK-cell differentiation, and prolongation of survival. These studies lay the foundation for epigenetic-directed therapy in ENKTL.&lt;/p&gt;Significance:&lt;p&gt;Through epigenetic and transcriptomic analyses of ENKTL, a rare, aggressive malignancy, along with normal NK-cell developmental intermediates, we identified that extreme DNA hypermethylation targets genes required for NK-cell development.

'Marvel') was used to investigate the role and relationship between CH4 and BRs during adventitious root (AR) formation. The results showed a dose-dependent effect of CH4 and BRs on rooting, with the greatest biological effects of methane-rich water (MRW, CH4 donor) and 2,4-epibrassinolide (EBL) at 20% and 1 μmol L- 1, respectively. The positive effect of MRW on AR formation was blocked by brassinoazole (Brz, a synthetic inhibitor of EBL), indicating that BRs might be involved in MRW-regulated AR formation. MRW promoted EBL accumulation during rooting by up-regulating the content of campestanol (CN), cathasterone (CT), and castasterone (CS) and the activity of Steroid 5α-reductase (DET2), 22α-hydroxylase (DWF4), and BR-6-oxidase (BR6ox), indicating that CH4 could induce endogenous brassinolide (BR) production during rooting. Further results showed that MRW and EBL significantly down-regulated the content of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin during rooting and significantly up-regulated the hydrolase activity, i.e. cmcase, xylanase and laccase. In addition, MRW and EBL also significantly promoted the activity of two major cell wall relaxing factors, xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase (XTH) and peroxidase, which in turn promoted AR formation. While, Brz inhibited the role of MRW on these substances.BR might be involved in CH4-promoted AR formation by increasing cell wall relaxation.",en

Genetic translocations at 14q32, particularly with partners like 16q23, lead to the dysregulation of oncogene expression, including the significant enhancement of c-Maf. This aberrant expression of c-Maf has prompted research into strategies for targeting this transcription factor as a potential therapeutic avenue for multiple myeloma treatment. In this study, we introduce a screening pipeline to test small compounds for their ability to inhibit c-Maf. Using a luciferase indicator driven by the Ccl8 gene promoter, we identified two small compounds that inhibit transcriptional activity of c-Maf. These molecules impede the proliferation of c-Maf-expressing myeloma cells, and repress the expression of c-Maf target genes such as ITGB7 and CCR1. Importantly, these molecules target c-Maf-expressing multiple myeloma cells, but not c-Maf-negative myeloma cells, showing potential for tailoring therapeutic intervention. In conclusion, our screening pipeline is effective to explore leads for a novel c-Maf inhibitor for multiple myeloma therapy.",en

Exosomes derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) can activate fibroblasts and promote tendon-bone healing via the contained microRNAs (miRNAs). However, the underlying mechanism is not comprehensively understood. Herein, this study aimed to identify overlapped BMSC-derived exosomal miRNAs in three GSE datasets, and to verify their effects as well as mechanisms on fibroblasts.To identify overlapped BMSC-derived exosomal miRNAs in three GSE datasets and verify their effects as well as mechanisms on fibroblasts.BMSC-derived exosomal miRNAs data (GSE71241, GSE153752, and GSE85341) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The candidate miRNAs were obtained by the intersection of three data sets. TargetScan was used to predict potential target genes for the candidate miRNAs. Functional and pathway analyses were conducted using the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases, respectively, by processing data with the Metascape. Highly interconnected genes in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were analyzed using Cytoscape software. Bromodeoxyuridine, wound healing assay, collagen contraction assay and the expression of COL I and α-smooth muscle actin positive were applied to investigate the cell proliferation, migration and collagen synthesis. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was applied to determine the cell fibroblastic, tenogenic, and chondrogenic potential.Bioinformatics analyses found two BMSC-derived exosomal miRNAs, has-miR-144-3p and has-miR-23b-3p, were overlapped in three GSE datasets. PPI network analysis and functional enrichment analyses in the GO and KEGG databases indicated that both miRNAs regulated the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway by targeting phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). In vitro experiments confirmed that miR-144-3p and miR-23b-3p stimulated proliferation, migration and collagen synthesis of NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Interfering with PTEN affected the phosphorylation of Akt and thus activated fibroblasts. Inhibition of PTEN also promoted the fibroblastic, tenogenic, and chondrogenic potential of NIH3T3 fibroblasts.BMSC-derived exosomes promote fibroblast activation possibly through the PTEN and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways, which may serve as potential targets to further promote tendon-bone healing.",en

It is a spore-forming bacterium. During sporulation, it produces a wide range of crystalline proteins that are toxic to different orders of insects. Sporulation, structure assembly, and germination are essential stages in the cell cycle of B. thuringiensis. The majority of studies on these issues have focused on the model organism Bacillus subtilis, followed by Bacillus cereus and Bacillus anthracis. The machinery for sporulation and germination extrapolated to B. thuringiensis. However, in the light of recent findings concerning the role of the sporulation proteins (SPoVS), the germination receptors (Gr), and the cortical enzymes in Bt, the theory strengthened that conservation in sporulation, structure assembly, and germination programs drive the survival and success of B. thuringiensis in the environment and the insect host.

However, due to the complexity of components and diversity of targets, the mechanisms are still not fully elucidated. Objective: In this research, we systematically analysed the targets of BXXXD through the method of network pharmacology and further validated them through experiments. Methods: The active components and therapeutic targets were identified, and these targets were analysed by the methods of gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis. Then, based on these network pharmacology analyses, we validated the main targets through animal experiments. Results: A total of 169 active components and 159 targets were identified. KEGG analysis showed that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) signalling pathway, the phosphatidylinositol 3' -kinase (PI3K), Akt signalling pathway, and other pathways were related to the treatment of T2DM by BXXXD. PPI network analysis showed that the key genes included signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3), JUN, TNF, Recombinant V-Rel Reticuloendotheliosis Viral Oncogene Homolog A (RELA), Akt/PKB- 1 (Protein kinase B), TP53, mitogen-activated protein kinase-1 (MAPK-1), mitogen-activated protein kinase-3 (MAPK-3), interleukin- 6 (IL6), and mitogen-activated protein kinase-14 (MAPK- 14), respectively. Animal experiments showed that BXXXD could reduce blood glucose and improve insulin resistance, which may be related to the mechanisms of inhibiting TNF, interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and interleukin-17 (IL-17) and promoting Akt phosphorylation.

To address this, we develop a suite of mathematical tools to search for statistically significant co-locations amongst immune and structural cells identified using 37-plex imaging mass cytometry. This unbiased method reveals a cellular map interleaved with an inflammatory network of immature neutrophils, cytotoxic CD8 T cells, megakaryocytes and monocytes co-located with regenerating alveolar progenitors and endothelium. Of note, a highly active cluster of immature neutrophils and CD8 T cells, is found spatially linked with alveolar progenitor cells, and temporally with the diffuse alveolar damage stage.

However, epidemiological studies report contradictory effects of infection exposure on subsequent B-ALL risk, and no specific pathogen has been definitively linked to the disease. A unifying mechanism to explain the divergent outcomes could inform disease prevention strategies. We previously reported that the pattern recognition receptor (PRR) ligand Poly(I:C) exerted effects on B-ALL cells that were distinct from those observed with other nucleic acid-based PRR ligands. Here, using multiple double-stranded RNA moieties, we show that the overall outcome of exposure to Poly(I:C) reflects the balance of opposing responses induced by its ligation to endosomal and cytoplasmic receptors. This PRR response biology is shared between mouse and human B-ALL and increases leukemia-initiating cell burden in vivo during the preleukemia phase of B-ALL, primarily through TNF-alpha signaling. The age of the responding immune system further influences the impact of dsRNA exposure on B-ALL cells in both mouse and human settings. Overall, our study demonstrates that potentially pro- and anti-leukemic effects can each be generated by stimulation of pathogen recognition pathways and indicates a mechanistic explanation for the contrasting epidemiologic associations reported for infection exposure and B-ALL.",en

During mating, ACPs are transferred along with sperms inside female bodies and have a significant impact on the post-mating physiology changes of the females. Under sexual selection pressures, the ACPs exhibit remarkably rapid and divergent evolution and vary from species to species. The diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), is a major insect pest of cruciferous vegetables worldwide. Mating has a profound impact on the females’ behavior and physiology in this species. It is still unclear what the ACPs are in this species. In this study, two different proteomic methods were used to identify ACPs in P. xylostella. The proteins of MAGs were compared immediately before and after mating by using a tandem mass tags (TMT) quantitative proteomic analysis. The proteomes of copulatory bursas (CB) in mated females shortly after mating were also analyzed by the shotgun LC-MS/MS technique. In total, we identified 123 putative secreted ACPs. Comparing P. xylostella with other four insect ACPs, trypsins were the only ACPs detected in all insect species. We also identified some new insect ACPs, including proteins with chitin binding Peritrophin-A domain, PMP-22/ EMP/ MP20/ Claudin tight junction domain-containing protein, netrin-1, type II inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphatase, two spaetzles, allatostatin-CC, and cuticular protein.

Annotation using common tools and databases predicted functions for a few genes like the type B DNA polymerase (MetSVORF07) or the small (MetSVORF15) and major (MetSVORF16) capsid proteins. For verification of assigned functions of additional ORFs, biochemical or genetic approaches were found to be essential. Consequently, we established a genetic system for MetSV by cloning its genome into the E. coli plasmid pCR-XL-2. Comparisons of candidate plasmids with the MetSV reference based on Nanopore sequencing revealed several mutations of yet unknown provenance with an impact on protein-coding sequences. Linear MetSV inserts were generated by BamHI restriction, purified and transformed in Methanosarcina mazei by an optimized liposome-mediated transformation protocol. Analysis of resulting MetSV virions by TEM imaging and infection experiments demonstrated no significant differences between plasmid-born viruses and native MetSV particles regarding their morphology or lytic behavior. The functionality of the genetic system was tested by the generation of a ΔMetSVORF09 mutant that was still infectious.

Millions to billions of these lymphocytes are generated through T-lineage development in the thymus, each endowed with a clonally restricted surface T-cell receptor (TCR). An individual TCR has the capacity to recognize a distinct “foreign” peptide among the myriad of antigens that the mammalian host must be capable of detecting. TCRs explicitly distinguish foreign from self-peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. This is a daunting challenge, given that the MHC-linked peptidome consists of thousands of distinct peptides with a relevant nonself target antigen often embedded at low number, among orders of magnitude higher frequency self-peptides. In this Masters of Immunology article, I review how TCR structure and attendant mechanobiology involving nonlinear responses affect sensitivity as well as specificity to meet this requirement. Assessment of human tumor-cell display using state-of-the-art mass spectrometry physical detection methods that quantify epitope copy number can help to provide information about requisite T-cell functional avidity affording protection and/or therapeutic immunity.

While previous research suggests that these domains can activate the small GTPases RhoA and RhoQ in cells, in vitro characterization of these interactions using biophysical techniques has been hampered by the intrinsic instability of obscurin GEF domains. To study substrate specificity, mechanism and regulation of obscurin GEF function by individual domains, we successfully optimized recombinant production of obscurin GEF domains and found that MST-family kinases phosphorylate the obscurin DH domain at Thr5798. Despite extensive testing of multiple GEF domain fragments, we did not detect any nucleotide exchange activity in vitro against 9 representative small GTPases. Bioinformatic analyses show that obscurin differs from other Trio-subfamily GEFs in several important aspects. While further research is necessary to evaluate obscurin GEF activity in vivo, our results indicate that obscurin has atypical GEF domains that, if catalytically active at all, are subject to complex regulation.",en

In order to better understand the process of gene duplication and its role in the formation of new enzymes, we investigated recent duplication events in the M14 family of proteolytic enzymes. Within vertebrates, four of 23 M14 genes were frequently found in duplicate form. While AEBP1, CPXM1, and CPZ genes were duplicated once through a large-scale, likely whole-genome duplication event, the CPO gene underwent many duplication events within fish and Xenopus lineages. Bioinformatic analyses of enzyme specificity and conservation suggested a greater amount of neofunctionalization and purifying selection in CPO paralogs compared with other CPA/B enzymes. To examine the functional consequences of evolutionary changes on CPO paralogs, the four CPO paralogs from Xenopus tropicalis were expressed in Sf9 and HEK293T cells. Immunocytochemistry showed subcellular distribution of Xenopus CPO paralogs to be similar to that of human CPO.

Strain Y8, used commercially in sweet baking doughs, exhibited greater stress tolerance than Y9, a strain employed in regular doughs. Survival of Y8 was higher than that of Y9 (30% vs 12%) after F-T or other reactive oxygen species (ROS) inducing stresses compared to their non-stressed controls. The superior F-T tolerance of Y8 was related to its lower ROS accumulation capacity, determined by fluorometry in cell-free extracts and in vivo, by fluorescence microscopy upon F-T, being Y8 ROS accumulation 2-fold lower than that of Y9. That, in turn, could be positively associated with Y8's higher constitutive activities of cytosolic catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase by a significant activation (25%) of Y8 CAT after F-T.

These allelochemicals are secondary metabolites found in different concentrations in shoots, roots, leaves, flowers, and even pollen grains. Allelochemicals have potential as natural bioherbicides for controlling weeds when applied in the form of extracts or through intercropping, cover cropping, and mulching. The present study was conducted to investigate the allelopathic potential of Ficus nitida leaves against Echinochloa crus-galli L. and Corchorus olitorius L weeds associated with sunflower plant via two application methods (mixing of F. nitida leaf powder with soil and foliar spray of F. nitida leaf powder alcoholic extract). Two pot experiments were carried out for the two summer seasons of 2020 and 2021 in the greenhouse of the National Research Centre (NRC), Dokki, Giza, Egypt. Nine treatments were applied in a completely randomized block design. Three treatments were applied before sowing, namely F. nitida leaf powder was mixed with the soil at rates of 15, 30, and 45 g/pot. The other three treatments of alcoholic leaf powder extract of F. nitida were sprayed twice on both plants and weeds at 10, 20, and 30% (w/v) concentrations. Additionally, three check treatments—healthy (sunflower only), unweeded, and both weeds only—were applied for comparison. The recorded results showed that F. nitida had an allelopathic bioherbicidal effect on both weeds. By increasing the concentration of F. nitida extract, the bioherbicidal potential increased. Moreover, the recorded results showed that foliar spray of alcoholic extract at 30% concentration was the superior application method for controlling weeds. Mixing of F. nitida leaf powder at 45 g/pot ranked second after this superior treatment. A noticeable result is that these two superior treatments improved sunflower growth parameters and yield traits. Quantitative estimation of phenolic compounds and flavonoids demonstrated that the concentration of these allelochemicals is higher in alcoholic extract than in water extract. Moreover, phenolic acid concentrations as detected by high-performance liquid chromatography fractionation are higher in alcoholic extract than in water extract.",en

To investigate the effects of aging on rod bipolar cells and their ribbon synapses, we compared synaptic calcium currents, calcium dynamics, and exocytosis in zebrafish (Danio rerio) that were middle-aged (MA,18 months) or old-aged (OA, 36 months). The bipolar cell terminal in OA zebrafish exhibited a two-fold reduction in number of synaptic ribbons, an increased ribbon length, and a decrease in local Ca2+ signals at the tested ribbon location, with little change in the overall magnitude of the calcium current or exocytosis in response to brief pulses. Staining of the synaptic ribbons with antibodies specific for PKCa revealed shortening of the inner nuclear and plexiform layers (INL and IPL). These findings shed light on age-related changes in the retina that are related to synaptic ribbons and calcium signals.",en

(Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in response to seed extract of Annona squamosa Linn.The tobacco caterpillar, Spodoptera litura F., is one of the most devastating, cosmopolitan polyphagous pests affecting major crops that significantly impact agricultural productivity. The present study aimed to evaluate the toxicological effect of seed extract of the medicinal plant, Annona squamosa L. and the histological effect on the midgut of Spodoptera litura F., under laboratory conditions. The crude methanolic extract of A. squamosa seed was tested against the third instar larvae of S. litura at five different concentrations viz., 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0% and 2.5 % by leaf dip bioassay method. The seed extract exhibited larval mortality of 96.67%, 83.37 %,70%, 53.33% and 40 % at the concentrations 2.5 %, 2.0%, 1.5%, 1.0% and 0.5%, respectively.The results indicated that the response of larval mortality to the seed extract was dose-dependent. The dose of 0.5% showed the lowest mortality (40.00%), while the dose of 2.5 % showed maximum larval mortality (96.67%). Hence they were subjected to histological analysis. The anatomical sectioning of S. litura larval midgut treated with 0.5% concentration showed disruption in the peritrophic membrane and striated border of epithelial cells. The midgut of larvae treated with 2.5 % concentration showed an irregular epithelium and high vacuolization in the cytoplasmic cells. The results indicated that methanol extract of A. squamosa seed extract has the ability to cause changes in the midgut region, thereby affecting the digestion and nutrient absorption of S. litura larvae, which will lead to a debilitating effect on the development of larvae. Based on the present study A. squamosa seed extract will be a potential biopesticide for managing S. litura.",en

Here, I apply the geometric model to predict differences between the evolution of altruistic versus nonsocial phenotypes. I recover Kimura’s prediction that probability of fixation is greater for mutations of intermediate size, but I find that the effect size that maximises probability of fixation is relatively small in the context of altruism and relatively large in the context of nonsocial phenotypes, and that the overall probability of fixation is lower for altruism and is higher for nonsocial phenotypes. Accordingly, the first selective substitution is expected to be smaller, and to take longer, in the context of the evolution of altruism. These results strengthen the justification for employing streamlined social evolutionary methodologies that assume adaptations are underpinned by many genes of small effect.",en

However, the function of pear PbrEBFs in ethylene-dependent responses during fruit ripening remains unclear. In this study, PbrEBF1, PbrEBF2, and PbrEBF3 display contrasting expression patterns in response to ethylene and 1-MCP treatment. PbrEBF3 displayed potential fruit ripening-associated function in a transient expression experiment. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and Firefly luciferase complementation imaging (LCI) assays indicated that PbrEBF3 interacts with PbrEIL1, PbrEIL2, and PbrEIL3 proteins. In turn, the transcription of PbrEBF3 is directly regulated by PbrEILs via a feedback loop. PbrEILs trigger a transcriptional cascade of PbrERF24 and finally affect ethylene synthesis. Overall, PbrEBF3 plays a central role in pear fruit ripening through mediation of the ethylene signaling pathway.",en

While CTCF biology has been extensively studied, how the domains of CTCF function to regulate transcription remains unknown. Additionally, the original auxin-inducible degron 1 (AID1) system has limitations in investigating the function of CTCF. Results We employ an improved auxin-inducible degron technology, AID2, to facilitate the study of acute depletion of CTCF while overcoming the limitations of the previous AID system. As previously observed through the AID1 system and steady-state RNA analysis, the new AID2 system combined with SLAM-seq confirms that CTCF depletion leads to modest nascent and steady-state transcript changes. A CTCF domain sgRNA library screening identifies the zinc finger (ZF) domain as the region within CTCF with the most functional relevance, including ZFs 1 and 10. Removal of ZFs 1 and 10 reveals genomic regions that independently require these ZFs for DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Notably, loci regulated by either ZF1 or ZF10 exhibit unique CTCF binding motifs specific to each ZF. Conclusions By extensively comparing the AID1 and AID2 systems for CTCF degradation in SEM cells, we confirm that AID2 degradation is superior for achieving miniAID-tagged protein degradation without the limitations of the AID1 system. The model we create that combines AID2 depletion of CTCF with exogenous overexpression of CTCF mutants allows us to demonstrate how peripheral ZFs intricately orchestrate transcriptional regulation in a cellular context for the first time.",en

In recent years, an increasing number of studies reported that bile acids (BAs) of intestinal flora origin affect T helper cells and regulatory T cells (Treg cells). Th17 cells play a pro‐inflammatory role and Treg cells usually act in an immunosuppressive role. In this review, we emphatically summarised the influence and corresponding mechanism of different configurations of lithocholic acid (LCA) and deoxycholic acid (DCA) on intestinal Th17 cells, Treg cells and intestinal immune microenvironment. The regulation of BAs receptors G protein‐coupled bile acid receptor 1 (GPBAR1/TGR5) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) on immune cells and intestinal environment are elaborated. Furthermore, the potential clinical applications above were also concluded in three aspects. The above will help researchers better understand the effects of gut flora on the intestinal immune microenvironment via BAs and contribute to the development of new targeted drugs.",en

Against this background, the present investigation aims to reconstruct genome and transcriptome metrics in the last common ancestor (LCA) of Syndermata. We especially annotated nuclear genome assemblies of one representative, each, of monogononts ( Brachionus plicatilis ), bdelloids ( Adineta vaga ), seisonids ( Seison nebaliae ), and acanthocephalans ( Pomphorhynchus laevis ), S1 and additionally considered previously published data. Present results suggest that the syndermatan LCA possessed a compact nuclear genome of 50–100 Mb with a coding portion of ≥ 40%. Its ~ 17,000 protein-coding genes probably had about 4–6 exons and 3–5 introns on average. Long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) should have occupied 4–5% of the ancestral genome. Based on this, independent evolutionary trajectories involving gene loss, genome duplication, and repeat proliferation resulted in greatly varying genomes within the clade. Nevertheless, we identified 2114 clusters containing proteins of all four syndermatan taxa. About 200 of these clusters lacked sufficiently similar counterparts in the platyhelminths Macrostomum lignano and Schmidtea mediterranea . Gene ontologies assigned to these clusters might reference the muscular pharynx, light perception, and transposition, amongst others.",en

We conducted a screen for genes required for efficient degradation of Deg1-Sec62, a model aberrant translocon-associated substrate of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ubiquitin ligase Hrd1, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This screen revealed that INO4 is required for efficient Deg1-Sec62 degradation. INO4 encodes one subunit of the Ino2/Ino4 heterodimeric transcription factor, which regulates expression of genes required for lipid biosynthesis. Deg1-Sec62 degradation was also impaired by mutation of genes encoding several enzymes mediating phospholipid and sterol biosynthesis. The degradation defect in ino4Δ yeast was rescued by supplementation with metabolites whose synthesis and uptake are mediated by Ino2/Ino4 targets. Stabilization of a panel of substrates of the Hrd1 and Doa10 ER ubiquitin ligases by INO4 deletion indicates ER protein quality control is generally sensitive to perturbed lipid homeostasis. Loss of INO4 sensitized yeast to proteotoxic stress, suggesting a broad requirement for lipid homeostasis in maintaining proteostasis. A better understanding of the dynamic relationship between lipid homeostasis and proteostasis may lead to improved understanding and treatment of several human diseases associated with altered lipid biosynthesis.",en

However, how wild mammal corpses decomposition influence and change ARGs in the environment has less explored. Through metagenomics, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and physicochemical analysis, this study explored the succession patterns, influencing factors, and assembly process of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in gravesoil during long-term corpse decomposition of wild mammals. Our results indicate that the ARG and MGE communities related to wildlife corpses exhibited a pattern of differentiation first and then convergence. Different from the farmed animals, the decomposition of wild animals first reduced the diversity of ARGs and MGEs, and then recovered to a level similar to that of the control group (untreated soil). ARGs and MGEs of the gravesoil are mainly affected by deterministic processes in different stages. MGEs and bacterial community are the two most important factors affecting ARGs in gravesoil. It is worth noting that the decomposition of wild animal carcasses enriched different high-risk ARGs at different stages (bacA, mecA and floR), which have co-occurrence patterns with opportunistic pathogens (Comamonas and Acinetobacter), thereby posing a great threat to public health. These results are of great significance for wildlife corpse management and environmental and ecological safety.",en

A genome-wide miRNA microarray was used to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in HCCs arisen on cirrhotic livers. Thirty-five miRNAs were identified. Several of these miRNAs were previously found deregulated in other human cancers, such as members of the &lt;i&gt;let-7&lt;/i&gt; family, &lt;i&gt;mir-221,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;mir-145&lt;/i&gt;. In addition, the hepato-specific &lt;i&gt;miR-122a&lt;/i&gt; was found down-regulated in ∼70% of HCCs and in all HCC-derived cell lines. Microarray data for &lt;i&gt;let-7a, mir-221,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;mir-122a&lt;/i&gt; were validated by Northern blot and real-time PCR analysis.

Nanobodies are the variable domains of the heavy chains of camelid heavy-chain antibodies (VHHs) with high affinity to their antigens and have applications in basic research, similar to traditional antibodies. In addition, nanobodies acting as functionalized antibodies or protein binders have become an additional valuable approach in Drosophila . This study aimed to develop a VHH library against Drosophila proteins and confirm its availability by retrieving some Drosophila protein-specific nanobodies from the library. Methods: An alpaca was first immunized with Drosophila embryo lysate and then its lymphocytes were isolated. Total RNA was extracted and cDNA was synthesized. The vhh sequences were amplified by two round PCR, which were then ligated to a phage display vector pADL-10b. The ligation products were transduced into SS320 competent cells to generate a VHH library. From this library, nanobodies against CG7544, Myc, and CyclinE was enriched and screened by phage display technology and ELISA. DNA sequences of identified nanobodies were cloned into pADL-10b-Flag-His for expression and purification in Escherichia coli SS320. Binding ability of purified nanobodies with corresponding antigens were determined by ELISA and surface plasmon resonance in vitro . Results: In this study, an immune VHH library against Drosophila embryo proteins was generated with a capacity of 3 × 10 7 . From this library, eight nanobodies against three Drosophila proteins, Myc, CyclinE, and CG7544, were identified and the DNA sequences of these nanobodies were obtained. These nanobodies were successfully expressed and purified from Escherichia coli SS320, and were demonstrated to bind corresponding antigens with high affinity in vitro . Moreover, the equilibrium constant between the highest enriched nanobodies and corresponding antigens were calculated. Conclusion: In summary, we report the availability of an immune VHH library and a highly efficient panning strategy for nanobodies against proteins in Drosophila .",en

The aim of this study was to test a local source tracking database by choosing an environment frequently used by veterinary students and veterinarians and by identifying resident microbiota composition and their sources of contamination (animals, environment, human beings…). The 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing was used to determine the bacterial taxonomic profiles of restroom surfaces. Bacterial sources were identified by linking our metadata-enriched local database to the microbiota profiling analysis using high-quality sequences. Microbiota profiling shows the dominance of four phyla: Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes. If the restroom cleaning process did not appear to impact microbiota composition, significant differences regarding bacterial distribution were observed between men and women users in different sampling campaigns. Combining 16S rDNA profiling to our specific sources labeling pipeline we found aquatic and human origins sources were the primary environment keywords in our campaigns. The probable presence of known animal sources (bovids, insects, equids, suids…) associated with bacterial genera such as Chryseobacterium, Bergeyella, Fibrobacter, and Syntrophococcus was also involved in restroom surfaces, emphasizing the proximity between these restrooms and the exchange of bacteria between people involved in animals handling. To summarize, we have demonstrated that DNA sequence-based source tracking may be integrated with high-throughput bacterial community analysis to enrich microbial investigation of potential bacterial contamination sources especially for little known or poorly identified taxa.

Inactivated whole virusor large protein fragments-based severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines have high unnecessary antigenic load to induce allergenicity and/orreactogenicity, which can be avoided by peptide vaccines of short peptide fragments that may induce highly targeted immune response. However, epitope identification and peptide delivery remain the major obstacles in developing peptide vaccines. Here, a multi-source data integrated linear B-cell epitope screening strategy is presented and a linear B-cell epitope enriched hotspot region is identified in Spike protein, from which a monomeric peptide vaccine (Epitope25) is developed and applied to subcutaneously immunize wildtype BALB/c mice. Indirect ELISA assay reveals specific and dose-dependent binding between Epitope25 and serum IgG antibodies from immunized mice. The neutralizing activity of sera from vaccinated mice is validated by pseudo and live SARS-CoV-2 wild-type strain neutralization assays. Then a dissolvable microneedle array (DMNA) is developed to pain-freely deliver Epitope25. Compared with intramuscular injection, DMNA and subcutaneous injection elicit neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 wild-type strain as demonstrated by live SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization assay.

Although previous investigations have suggested phosphorylation-based regulation of AGPase in maize, the explicit modulation mechanisms have yet to be elucidated. This research evaluated the effect of point mutations at phosphorylation sites (identified using iTRAQTM AB SCIEX, Framingham, MA, USA) on the subcellular localization and activity of the AGPase small subunit Bt2, and its interaction with the large subunit Sh2, in maize. Despite the induction of point mutations, subcellular localization of the Bt2 subunit remained unaltered, primarily within the cytoplasm and nucleus. The interaction between Bt2 and Sh2 subunits continued, mainly in the chloroplast. Notably, an increase in AGPase activity was observed in the case of simulated phosphorylation point mutations, whereas dephosphorylation activity significantly diminished relative to the wild type. These findings demonstrate that point mutations do not affect the subcellular localization of the Bt2 subunit or its interaction with the Sh2 subunit, but substantially modulate AGPase activity. This study provides critical insights into the role of point mutations in enhancing AGPase activity, thus potentially accelerating the production of ADP-Glc, the primary substrate for starch synthesis, promising implications for improved starch biosynthesis in maize.",en

Needless to say, angiosperms are the most important group for the humans. The studies on the origin, evolution and systematics of angiosperms have been the major challenges in plant sciences. However, the origin and early history of angiosperms remains poorly understood and controversial among paleobotanists. Some paleobotanists insist that there were no angiosperms in the pre-Cretaceous age. However, this conclusion is facing increasing challenges from fossil evidence, especially Early Jurassic Nanjinganthus, which is based on over two hundred specimens of fossil flowers. Studying more fossil plants is the only reliable way to elucidate the origin and early evolution of angiosperms. Here, we document a new species of angiosperms, Qingganninginfructus formosa gen. et sp. nov, and provide the first detailed three-dimensional morphology of Qingganninginfructus gen. nov from the Middle Jurassic of Northwest China. A Micro-CT examination shows that the best-preserved fossil infructescence has eleven samaroid fruits, each with a single basal ovule. Since these fossils are distinct in morphology and organization from all organs of known gymnosperms and angiosperms (the latter are defined by their enclosed ovules), we interpret Qingganninginfructus as a new genus of angiosperms including a new species, Q. formosa gen. et sp. nov., and an unspecified species from the Middle Jurassic of Northwest China. The discovery of this new genus of angiosperms from the Middle Jurassic, in addition to the existing records, undermines the ""no angiosperms until the Cretaceous"" stereotype and updates the perspective on the origin and early history of angiosperms.",en

Thus, identifying the driver genes associated with metastasis of TNBC is urgently needed. CRISPR screens have dramatically enhanced genome editing and made it possible to identify genes associated with metastasis. In this study, we identified and explored the crucial role of ras homolog family member V (RhoV) in TNBC metastasis. Here, we performed customized in vivo CRISPR screens targeting metastasis-related genes obtained from transcriptome analysis of TNBC. The regulatory role of RhoV in TNBC was validated using gain- or loss-of-function studies in vitro and in vivo. We further conducted immunoprecipitation and LC-MS/MS to explore the metastasis mechanism of RhoV. In vivo functional screens identified RhoV as a candidate regulator involved in tumor metastasis. RhoV was frequently upregulated in TNBC and correlated with poor survival. Knockdown of RhoV significantly suppressed cell invasion, migration, and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we provided evidence that p-EGFR interacted with RhoV to activate the downstream signal pathway of RhoV, thereby promoting tumor metastasis. We further confirmed that this association was dependent on GRB2 through a specific proline-rich motif in the N-terminus of RhoV. This mechanism of RhoV is unique, as other Rho family proteins lack the proline-rich motif in the N-terminus.",en

This remains understudied, especially with regard to interactive effects between aquatic pollutants and natural abiotic stressors. We studied effects of exposure to the pesticide DNP (2,4-Dinitrophenol) and how these were modulated by limited food availability in the aquatic larvae, and the possible delayed effects in the terrestrial adults of the damselfly Lestes viridis. Our results revealed that DNP and low food each had large negative effects on the life history, behaviour and to a lesser extent on the physiology of not only the larvae, but also the adults. Food limitation magnified the negative effects of DNP as seen by a strong decline in larval survival, metamorphosis success and adult lifespan. Notably, the synergism between the aquatic pollutant and food limitation for survival-related traits was stronger in the non-exposed adults than in the exposed larvae, likely because metamorphosis is stressful itself. Our results highlight that identifying effects of aquatic pollutants and synergisms with natural abiotic stressors, not only in the aquatic larval but also in the terrestrial adult stage, is crucial to fully assess the ecological impact of aquatic pollutants and to reveal the impact on the receiving terrestrial ecosystem through a changed aquatic-terrestrial subsidy.",en

Both anti-predator strategies primarily rely on colour to succeed, but the specific patterning used is also important. While the role of patterning in camouflage is relatively clear, the design features of aposematic patterns are less well understood. Here, we use a comparative approach to investigate how pattern use varies across a phylogeny of 268 species of cryptic and aposematic butterfly larvae, which also vary in social behaviour. We find that longitudinal stripes are used more frequently by cryptic larvae, and that patterns putatively linked to crypsis are more likely to be used by solitary larvae. By contrast, aposematic larvae are more likely to use horizontal bands and spots, but we find no differences in the use of individual pattern elements between solitary and gregarious aposematic species. However, solitary aposematic larvae are more likely to display multiple pattern elements, whereas those with no pattern are more likely to be gregarious. Our study advances our understanding of how pattern variation, coloration and social behaviour covary across lepidopteran larvae, and highlights new questions about how patterning affects larval detectability and predator responses to aposematic prey.",en

Currently, the disease is present as a pandemic affecting pork production in Eurasia and the Caribbean region. The etiological agent of ASF is a large, highly complex structural virus (ASFV) harboring a double-stranded genome encoding for more than 160 proteins whose functions, in most cases, have not been experimentally characterized. We show here that deletion of the ASFV gene H240R from the genome of the highly virulent ASFV-Georgia2010 (ASFV-G) isolate partially decreases virus virulence when experimentally inoculated in domestic swine.

Weed identification and plant count were carried out in pastures with four levels of degradation, classified as low (N1), moderate (N2), strong (N3) and very strong (N4), with five replications. Thirty-nine weed species were identified and distributed into16 botanical families. Poaceae, Asteraceae and Fabaceae were the most relevant families. The number and density of weeds increased as the level of degradation decreased. The relative importance of weed species varied with the level of degraded pasture. The main weeds found in N1 were Melinis minutiflora, Desmodium incanum, Croton lundianus, Andropogon bicornis, and Imperata brasiliensis; in N2: Paspalum notatum, Melinis minutiflora, Imperata brasiliensis, Sida rhombifolia, and Desmodium incanum; in N3: Paspalum notatum, Melinis minutiflora, Sida rhombifolia, Eupatorium maximilianii, and Imperata brasiliensis; in N4: Paspalum notatum, Melinis minutiflora, Cynodon dactilon, Eupatorium maximilianii, and Imperata brasiliensis. The similarity index was high, showing the homogeneity of weeds among areas. The predominant species, considering all areas, were in increasing order of importance: Cynodon dactilon, Melinis minutiflora and Paspalum notatum. Decision-making about applying control measures could be marked out when the plant density reached out or exceed the average of 3.58 plants m-2.",en

In this study, we report on the histopathological and immunohistochemical features of the gills of the crucian carp Carassius auratus challenged with Aeromonas hydrophila. Small RNA libraries of the gills were constructed and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. A total of 1,165 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were identified in gills, of which 539 known and 7 unknown DEMs were significantly screened (p < 0.05). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses revealed that the potential target genes/proteins were primarily involved in 33 immune-related pathways, in which the inflammatory responses were focused on the Toll-like receptor (TLR), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways. Moreover, the expression levels of 14 key miRNAs (e.g., miR-10, miR-17, miR-26a, miR-144, miR-145, and miR-146a) and their target genes (e.g., TNFα, TLR4, NF-κB, TAB1, PI3K, and IRAK1) were verified. In addition, the protein levels based on isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) were significantly associated with the results of the quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis (p < 0.01). miR-17/pre-miR-17 were identified in the regulation expression of the NF-κB target gene, and the phylogenetic tree analysis showed that the pre-miR-17 of C. auratus with the closest similarity to the zebrafish Danio rerio is highly conserved in teleosts. This is the first report of the multi-omics analysis of the miRNAs and proteins in the gills of C. auratus infected with A. hydrophila, thus enriching knowledge on the regulation mechanism of the local immune response in Cyprinidae fish.",en

One of the biologically active nutritional compounds is vitamin D3, which activates via its metabolite 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) the nuclear receptor VDR (vitamin D receptor). Vitamin D3 can be synthesized endogenously in our skin, but since we spend long times indoors and often live at higher latitudes where for many winter months UV-B radiation is too low, it became a true vitamin. The ligand-inducible transcription factor VDR is expressed in the majority of human tissues and cell types, where it modulates the epigenome at thousands of genomic sites. In a tissue-specific fashion this results in the up- and downregulation of primary vitamin D target genes, some of which are involved in attenuating oxidative stress. Vitamin D affects a wide range of physiological functions including the control of metabolism, bone formation and immunity. In this review, we will discuss how the epigenome- and transcriptome-wide effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 and its receptor VDR serve as a master example in nutrigenomics. In this context, we will outline the basis of a mechanistic understanding for personalized nutrition with vitamin D3.",en

Research designed with non-experimental. Two cultivars were studied, namely Sanren and Lokananta. Onion seeds were planted directly without transplanting, there were three plots (4 m x 1.6 m x 0.3 m) and three germination testplot (1 m x 1.6 m x 0.3 m). Soil tillage, spacing/ population, fertilization, plant maintenance and pest-diseases control in accordance with the recommendations. Research result obtained Sanren had higher germination (94.40%) and vigor index (60.60) then Lokananta. The growth of two onion cultivars showed good performance because there was no transplanting. Almost all the the variables for seedlings, vegetative organs and bulbs were significantly different between two cultivars. From the boxplot test, it was found that the data were of symmetry for Sanren (number stems, dry weight of leaves, and dry weight of bulb), and the Lokananta cultivar (vigor index, number of stems, number of bulbs, plant height and leaf dry weight). There was a significant correlation for Sanren (plant height with bulbs weight and number of roots), and Lokananta cultivars (number of roots with number of stems and leaf dry weight).

We found that the proportion of area outside the root cambium (Rs) was higher in the WT plants than in the CT plants and correlated positively with the proximity to the root tip. Furthermore, the content of all four coumarins was also higher in the WT plants relative to the CT plants. In addition, we identified 15,524 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two plant varieties. 11 DEGs are involved in the photoperiod and gibberellin pathways that regulate early bolting and 24 genes involved in coumarins biosynthesis were also identified.

These are tandemly repeated sequences observed almost all organisms and differentially distributed across the genome. Although the primary genome information of Orientia tsutsugamushi (OT) suggested the repeats hold the 40% entire of its genome, but lack of characteristic of this repeats increase our interest to study more about it. Thus we investigated a genome-wide presence of microsatellites within nine complete genomes within OT and analyzed their distribution pattern, composition and complexity. The in-silico study revealed the genome of OT enrich with microsatellites having a total of 126187 SSR and 10374 cSSR throughout the genome from which 70% and 30% represented within the coding and non coding region respectively. The relative density (RD) and relative abundance (RA) of SSRs were 42-44.43/kb and 6.25-6.59/kb while for cSSRs this value ranged from 7.06-8.1/kb and 0.50-0.55/kb respectively. However, RA and RD were weakly correlate with genome size and incidence microsatellites. The mononucleotide repeats (54.55%) were prevalent over di- (33.22%), tri- (11.88%), tetra- (0.27%), penta- (0.02%), hexanucleotide (0.04%) repeats, with poly (A/T) richness over poly (G/C). Motif composition of cSSRs revealed that maximum cSSRs were made up of two microsatellites having unique duplication pattern such as AT-x-AT, CG-x-CG. More numbers microsatellites represented within the coding region provides an insight into the genome plasticity that may interfere for gene regulation to mitigate with host-pathogen interaction and evolution of the species.",en

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the aggregate index of systemic inflammation (AISI), an emerging index derived from neutrophil, monocyte, platelet, and lymphocyte counts, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with different disease severity and survival status. We searched electronic databases between the 1st of December 2019 and the 10th of June 2023 and assessed the risk of bias and the certainty of evidence. In 13 studies, severe disease/death was associated with significantly higher AISI values on admission vs. non-severe disease/survival (standard mean difference (SMD) = 0.68, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.97, p &lt; 0.001). The AISI was also significantly associated with severe disease/death in five studies reporting odds ratios (4.39, 95% CI 2.12 to 9.06, p ˂ 0.001), but not in three studies reporting hazard ratios (HR = 1.000, 95% CI 0.999 to 1.002, p = 0.39). The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve values for severe disease/death were 0.66 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.73), 0.78 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.83), and 0.79 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.83), respectively.

The general objective was to determine the prevalence of FSGS, and to give its profiles; epidemiological, clinical, biological, pathological, etiological, therapeutic and evolutionary of FSGS. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective analytical study over a period of six years extending from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2015 patients aged 16 or over who were hospitalized or received consultations during the study period for primary or secondary segmental and focal hyalinosis. Patients whose records were incomplete or unusable were not included in the study. Results: We have 16.54% with 158 cases of FSGS out of 6945 patients received and/or hospitalized. Of the 955 kidney biopsies distributed, the incidences of HSF were; 10.15%; 14.04%; 15%; 17.64%; 20.11%; 19.58% respectively in 2010; 2011; 2012; 2013; 2014 and 2015, i.e. an annual increase of around 1.25%. Renal-type edemas were found in 93.3%, the first reason for hospitalization. And ninety-six people had impaired kidney function, or 61%. The average of 24-hour proteinuria was 6.4 ± 3.69 g/24 hours. The extremes were 0.37 and 18.50 g/24h. Patients had nephrotic proteinuria in 84.86%. Non-specific FSGS or NOS (Not Other Specificities) was found in 62 cases or 39.24%, collapsing FSGS in 48 cases or 30.40%. FSGS with found causes was associated with fibrosis in 5/35 cases. Collapsing FSGSs followed by NOS FSGSs were the most corticosteroid-resistant. The evolution of the FSGS reveals that every 8 months the proteinuria decreases by half. Conclusion: Segmental and focal hyalinosis requires histological confirmation and the epidemiological, clinico-biological, etiological, therapeutic and evolutionary profiles depend on the histological (pathological) type. Other works on the risk factors for occurrence and the contribution of electron microscopy in the primary and secondary diagnosis of segmental and focal hyalinosis are desired.",en
https://openalex.org/W4376226313,2023,Medicine,"Quick consults in hematology: Staging and treating immunoglobulin light chain (<scp>AL</scp>) amyloidosisA 67-year-old man was found to have proteinuria on a Medicare annual physical. He is referred to a nephrologist who performed a kidney biopsy showing amyloidosis confirmed to be immunoglobulin light chain by mass spectroscopic analysis. The patient is referred to you for further management. What is the appropriate diagnostic management for this patient: This patient needs a thorough evaluation to determine the extent of the amyloid which may be present outside of the kidney. Eighty-three percent of patients that present with renal amyloid nephrotic syndrome will have amyloid deposits outside of the kidney.1 Diagnostic evaluation should include the heart with echocardiography to include Doppler studies and global longitudinal strain. Cardiac biomarkers NT-proBNP and troponin provide insights as to the extent of cardiac cellular damage and cardiac insufficiency, these biomarkers also form the basis for the staging of amyloidosis. For most patients' cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is not required in the presence of a good quality echocardiogram. Alkaline phosphatase is the best laboratory measure for hepatic involvement. Right-sided heart failure may influence liver function, but this tends to impact transaminase levels making alkaline phosphatase a rather specific measure for liver involvement. Proof that there is an underlying clonal plasma cell dyscrasia is required before initiating anti plasma cell chemotherapy and should include immunofixation of serum and 24-h urine as well as immunoglobulin free light chain assay. A bone marrow should be performed when AL amyloidosis is confirmed by mass spectroscopic analysis of tissues. This allows the exclusion of overt multiple myeloma which may be an important consideration when the question of maintenance therapy comes up. In addition half of patients with light chain amyloidosis have the t(11;14) translocation. This is an important finding because if second-line therapy is required venetoclax may be an effective option in the presence of this translocation. In some instances, the diagnosis of amyloidosis can be verified non-invasively because 50% of bone marrow biopsies in amyloidosis patients will be Congo red positive. Exclusion of peripheral nerve amyloid can often be effectively performed using history and physical examination and does not routinely require electromyography. First-line therapy: (Figure 1) The ANDROMEDA trial was a randomized, open label, active controlled phase 3 study of daratumumab, bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone versus bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone alone in treatment naive patients with immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis. The key eligibility criteria required amyloid involvement of one organ and specifically excluded patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 20 mL/min. Patients also had to have an NT proBNP less than 8500 pg/mL. Patients in the control arm received standard weekly bortezomib, weekly cyclophosphamide, and weekly dexamethasone for a total of 24 weeks. In the daratumumab arm patients received the same dosing of bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone but also received daratumumab 1800 mg subcutaneously weekly for 8 weeks, every other week for 16 weeks, and then every 4 weeks for an additional 80 weeks. The primary endpoint of the study was overall hematologic complete response. At a median follow-up of 11.4 months the daratumumab group had a hematologic complete response rate of 53.3% compared to the control arm 18.1%.2 Hematologic response is important but only in so far as it leads to an organ response. Treating AL amyloidosis has several Goals: One is the prevention of end-stage renal or cardiac failure, another is preventing deposition of amyloid in other organs such as lung, nerve, and liver. Organ response results in prevention of end stage renal disease and advanced cardiac failure producing improved survival and improved quality of life. Hematologic response without organ response does not represent successful therapy. In the ANDROMEDA trial at 6 months the daratumumab containing arm showed a renal response of 53% compared to 23.9% in the non-daratumumab arm. Cardiac responses were seen in 41.5% of the daratumumab group versus 22.2% in the control group. In some patients advanced end organ damage is beyond recovery emphasizing the need for early diagnosis. In a follow-up trial daratumumab was administered to patient's ineligible for ANDROMEDA by virtue of advanced cardiac failure defined as an NT proBNP greater than 8500 pg/mL. Despite advanced cardiac disease the 12-month overall survival rate was 47% overall hematologic response was 74%.3 This suggests a trial of therapy is indicated for virtually all patients. What are the key monitoring end points of my treatment: Unlike multiple myeloma where patients with indolent disease may do well long-term with a partial response, this does not apply to amyloidosis. It is also important to note that the hematologic response criteria for amyloidosis differ from the hematologic response criteria for multiple myeloma. Patients that have a partial response defined by a 50% reduction in the dFLC have much shorter survival and a lower organ response rate than patients who achieve a very good partial response or better.4 Therefore, patients who failed to achieve a very good partial response after 4 cycles of therapy need to be considered for second-line therapy even in the face of a significant light chain reduction. Unfortunately, there are patients that achieve a hematologic response but still do not evidence an organ response. There is no consensus as to when second-line intervention should be introduced. A recent consensus review outlines the use of salvage stem cell transplantation for patients failing to achieve an adequate response.5 Models have been developed that integrate multiple organ and hematologic responses to predict early clinical benefit and may provide an early signal for the need to change therapy.6 What are my options for patients who either failed to achieve a very good partial response with first-line therapy or have a deep response but subsequently relapse and require salvage therapy? As many as 40% of patients will fail to achieve a deep hematologic response with first-line chemotherapy making a subsequent organ response quite unlikely. In addition, despite the indolent nature of the plasma cells in AL amyloidosis recurrence is common and there can be a need for second-line therapy for light chain amyloidosis patients. If the patient had not previously been exposed to daratumumab this would be important in a second-line combination. Stem cell transplantation is a highly effective intervention for AL amyloidosis. Its utilization has fallen significantly with the introduction of daratumumab based therapy. However, the kinetics of myeloablative doses of melphalan are significant even in patients that have previously received oral weekly cyclophosphamide. The use of stem cell transplantation as consolidation to try and deepen the response to induction therapy is done in a manner very similar to that of multiple myeloma. Special precautions are required for patients with amyloidosis reducing the pool of eligible patients for this technique. European myeloma network guidelines for safe transplantation have included age under 70, left ventricular ejection fraction greater than or equal to 40%, systolic blood pressure greater than 90, NT proBNP less than 5000 pg/mL and a high sensitivity troponin T less than 75 ng/mL. Patients with significant proteinuria should have a serum creatinine less than 2 mg/dL.7 For patients that are too high risk for myeloablative chemotherapy, venetoclax should be considered for those patients that demonstrate t(11;14). In a case series of 12 patients with relapsed disease venetoclax produced a complete response in 4 and a very good partial response in an additional 3 patients, overall response 58%.8 In a European case series, the hematologic complete response rate was 78% used in both relapsed patients and as consolidation. Venetoclax produced a hematologic response rate of 81% when t(11;14) was identified.9 It can be used in combination with Daratumumab, dexamethasone or bortezomib.10 It has not been demonstrated that combinations of venetoclax excepting dexamethasone offer an advantage. Immunomodulatory agents particularly lenalidomide but including pomalidomide can significantly exacerbate cardiac symptoms in patients with any degree of cardiac amyloidosis. This has led to their use only in 2nd or 3rd line. When combined with dexamethasone in a dose of 20 mg very good partial response or better has been reported in 18%–37% of patients. Toxicities associated with this regimen in the amyloid population included myelosuppression in 26%–45%, renal failure in 3%–7.5%, cardiac arrhythmias in 0%–21% and a rise in NT proBNP in the majority.11 Given the high activity of bortezomib in the treatment of light chain amyloidosis it would not be surprising to find that both ixazomib and carfilzomib are active. In a phase 3 trial of ixazomib and dexamethasone versus physician's choice, ixazomib had a favorable hazard ratio of 0.5 with a median time to vital organ deterioration or death of 34.8 months compared to 26.1 months.12 Carfilzomib has also been used but its administration in AL amyloidosis is challenging with 36% showing cardiac toxicity and a maximum tolerated dose of 36 mg/m2. The very good partial response rate or better with carfilzomib was 39%.13 Bendamustine has been used in the management of AL amyloidosis in the refractory relapsed setting. In a trial of 31 patients receiving 4–6 cycles 11% achieved a complete response and in 18% a very good partial response. An overall organ response rate was seen of 29%. No therapy related deaths were seen. The most common toxicity was hematologic, and the median progression-free survival was 11.3 months.14 Although it has been withdrawn from the market, belantamab has produced an overall response rate of 64% and a very good partial response or better of 55%.15 IgM amyloidosis represents 7% of all patients with light chain amyloidosis. The responsible cell for light chain production is a lymphoplasmacytic cell usually demonstrating MYD88 mutation rather than the CD 38+ plasma cell of the more common forms of light chain amyloidosis. Therapies have been developed from active regimens in macroglobulinemia.16 Conclusion: Highly effective therapy is now available for AL amyloidosis, but a good outcome requires an early diagnosis before the development of dialysis dependent renal failure or end-stage cardiomyopathy. When the diagnosis is made late in the disease course even the most highly effective anti-plasma cell chemotherapy cannot produce reversal of organ failure. Hematologists need a high index of suspicion when monitoring patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance or smoldering multiple myeloma. Screening of smoldering multiple myeloma patients over time using cardiac biomarkers and monitoring for albuminuria will increase recognition of this devastating disease early.

https://openalex.org/W4316174547,2023,Medicine,"French national diagnosis and care protocol (PNDS, protocole national de diagnostic et de soins): cystic lymphatic malformationsAbstract Cystic lymphatic malformations (LMs) are rare chronic conditions which management differs according to the type (macrocystic LMs, microcystic LMs or both). Studies are lacking due to rarity of the pathology. We aimed to establish a French National Diagnosis and Care Protocol (PNDS: Protocole National de Diagnostic et de Soins), to provide health professionals with free open access synthesis on optimal management and care of patients with LMs ( https://www.has-sante.fr/upload/docs/application/pdf/2021-03/malformations_lymphatiques_kystiques_-_pnds.pdf ). The process included a critical review of the literature and multidisciplinary expert consensus. LMs are congenital but are not always discovered at birth. Nearly 75% of them are located in the head and neck because of the highly dense lymphatic system in this region. Physical examination (showing painless masses with normal skin color and depressible consistency, or cutaneous/mucosal lymphangiectasia) and color Doppler ultrasonography, usually allow for diagnosis. MRI (involving T2 sequences with fat saturation in at least two spatial planes) is the tool of choice for evaluating anatomical extension, characterizing lesions (microcystic and macrocystic), and before considering therapeutic management. A biopsy, coupled to a blood sample, can also be used for molecular biology analyses, to search for activating mutations of the PIK3CA gene, particularly with LM integrating in a syndromic form (CLOVES or Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome) but also in certain isolated (or common) LMs. The spontaneous evolution of LMs, in particular microcystic forms, is often toward progressive aggravation, with an increase in the number of vesicles, thickening, increased oozing and bleeding, while pure macrocystic LMs may regress due to “natural sclerosis”, i.e. fibrosis secondary to an inflammatory reorganization after common infantile infections. In case of voluminous LMs or syndromic forms, functional and psychological repercussions can be major, deteriorating the patient’s quality of life. LMs must be treated by physicians integrated in multidisciplinary teams, and be personalized. Management is a life-long process that involves one or several of these therapies: conservative management, physical therapy (compression), sclerotherapy, surgery, drugs such as mTOR inhibitors (sirolimus), that has shown efficacy in decreasing the volume of LMs, and, more recently, PI3K-inhibitors in syndromic forms. Psychological and social support is necessary, taking into account the patient and his family.",en

Consequently, our scope of work is to investigate the ability of dulaglutide to indulgence depression via deeply reconnoitering the Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor and cAMP/PKA Signaling Pathway. Eighty mice were divided into two groups; one with and the other without the induction of chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). Each group was subdivided into two subsets; the first one was treated with saline for 42 days, while the other was treated with saline for 20 days, then with dulaglutide (0.6 mg/kg/week) for four weeks. CSDS group showed a lessening in the social interaction ratio and sucrose consumption. They spent less exploration time in the open arms, and more time in the closed arms in elevated plus maze test as compared to controls. Furthermore, the CSDS group had a higher expression of NOD- like receptor protein-3 which explained the elevation in inflammatory biomarkers (IL-1β, IL-18, IL-6 and TNF-α) along with diminution in GLP-1R, cAMP/PKA levels. Treatment with dulaglutide markedly reversed the above-mentioned parameters via bolstering the GLP-1R/cAMP/PKA pathway. NLRP3 inflammasome activation expedites depression. Dulaglutide activates the GLP-1R/cAMP/PKA pathway, hence offering a novel therapeutic intervention to hinder depression.",en

Times Have Changed: A Nationwide Analysis of Outcomes and Costs Associated with Early vs. Late Free Flap Reconstruction following Lower Extremity Trauma in 698 PatientsPURPOSE: For over 35 years the Godina Principle has governed the timing of free flap reconstruction (FFR) after lower extremity (LE) trauma. We aim to reevaluate the timing of LE FFR within 72 hours of injury. METHODS: The Nationwide Readmission Database (2015-2019) was queried for all admissions with acute LE trauma who received FFR. The association between flap timing and complications, readmissions, and costs was analyzed using risk-adjusted analyses. RESULTS: A total of 698 patients undergoing FFR after LE trauma were identified. Timing of FFR was stratified by immediate (0-72 hours), delayed (72 hours-10 days), and late (10+ days). Delay of FFR was not associated with increased risk of amputation or 30-day readmissions for surgical complications, surgical site infection (SSI), or any other complications. Delayed FFR was associated with higher predicted length of stay (LOS) (2.9 days, P=0.048) after FFR but not increased cost (P=0.628). Late FFR was also associated with increased LOS post FFR (6.11 days, P=0.032) but cost was again similar (P=0.641). CONCLUSION: Delay of FFR does not appear to increase risk of amputation, surgical complications, SSI, readmissions, or costs. Despite increased LOS, patients can benefit from FFR regardless of transfer delays to microsurgery-capable centers. Patients who previously were not considered candidates, may now be well-suited for FFR, resulting in improved psyche, quality of life, and societal re-integration.",en

IARC Press, Lyon2020Google Scholar These tumours show morphological overlap with ES but lack the characteristic EWSR1/FUS-ETS gene fusion and have been found to have a distinct clinicopathological profile. CRS represents up to 68% of EWSR1/FUS negative small round cell sarcomas, with DUX4 being the most common gene fusion partner.2Italiano A. Sung Y.S.

This case highlights the difficulties faced with the accurate classification of this tumour, confounded by an unusual location and uncommon histopathological features, which has significant clinical and prognostic implications. A 68-year-old woman presented with a one-month history of an enlarging painless left submandibular mass. Fine needle aspiration showed atypical cells suspicious for malignancy and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) demonstrated an FDG-avid centrally necrotic mass which appeared to arise from the anterolateral aspect of the submandibular gland. Neck dissection revealed a 35 mm mass affixed to the submandibular gland which was not involved on microscopy. The tumour had a multinodular growth pattern (Fig. 1A) with geographic necrosis (Fig. 1B) and invaded the surrounding fibroadipose tissue and an adjacent lymph node. It was composed of sheets of ovoid to epithelioid cells with strand formation in some areas associated with oedematous stroma (Fig. 1C,D). The cells had large ovoid to irregular nuclei, coarse chromatin and small nucleoli with a small to moderate amount of pale eosinophilic cytoplasm (Fig. 1E,F). There were occasional interspersed rhabdoid-like cells with eccentric nuclei and abundant dense eosinophilic cytoplasm (Fig. 1D,E). Frequent mitoses (56/10 HPF) (Fig. 1F) and lymphovascular invasion were identified and the tumour focally abutted the resection margin. Immunohistochemistry showed positive staining for p16, FLI-1 and nuclear reactivity for WT1 (Fig. 2A–C). There was patchy membranous staining for CD99 (Fig. 2D), patchy reactivity for GATA3 and ERG (Fig. 2E) and focal staining for calretinin (Fig. 2F), CD56, synaptophysin and CAM5.2. INI-1 and BRG1 showed retained expression. The tumour was negative for p63, p40, ER, TTF-1, CDX2, S100, SOX10, Melan A, chromogranin, SMA, SMMS, CD34, D2-40, CD45, CD20, CD3, CD30, NUT, EMA and a range of cytokeratins. The Ki-67 index was approximately 70%. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) was negative for EWSR1 and CIC rearrangement. Given a high degree of clinicopathological suspicion, whole genome/transcriptome sequencing was performed and demonstrated a CIC-DUX4 gene fusion which led to the diagnosis of CRS. Three months after adjuvant radiotherapy, subcarinal lymph node, pulmonary and pleural metastases were discovered on restaging PET/CT. The patient declined adjuvant chemotherapy due to unlikely meaningful benefit and succumbed to disease 12 months after initial presentation. CRS has a wide age range at presentation but most commonly affects young adults (median age 25–35 years) and has a slight male predominance.1World Health Organization Classification of Tumours Editorial BoardWorld Health Organization Classification of Tumours of Soft Tissue and Bone.5th ed.

These tumours are composed of sheets of medium-sized round cells, often with a lobulated growth pattern separated by fibrous bands. Minor components of epithelioid, rhabdoid or spindled cell morphology are often present. Interestingly, whereas most of the literature describes these heterogenous elements in focal aggregations, Rekhi et al. reported a case with ‘rhabdoid-like’ cells interspersed throughout round to polygonal cells as was observed in this case.4Rekhi B.

Mitotic activity is high (mean 30/10 HPF) and geographic necrosis is common. Focal myxoid stromal changes can be seen. Immunohistochemically, CRS usually shows variable CD99 staining, most often in a focal patchy pattern, and nuclear reactivity for ETV4 and WT1. These tumours can also show staining for calretinin, ERG and FLI-1. NKX2-2, keratin, S100 and myogenic markers are typically negative. CIC-DUX4 is the most common gene fusion in CRS resulting from the chromosomal translocations t(4; 19) (q35; q13) or t(10; 19) (q26; q13).2Italiano A. Sung Y.S.

CIC is a human homologue of the Drosophila capicua gene which encodes a high mobility group (HMG)-box transcriptional repressor. It is expressed in the developing cerebellum and involved in ErbB signalling which plays a role in cell growth and survival. CIC gene abnormalities have been implicated in some central nervous system malignancies. DUX4 is a subtelomeric gene that encodes a double-homeobox transcription factor expressed in germ cells but epigenetically silenced in differentiated tissues. Aberrant DUX4 expression has been linked to fascioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. The oncogenic chimeric protein is composed of most of the preserved CIC protein, including the HMG-box, with loss of a large portion of the DUX4 N-terminal region, including the double-homeobox domain. CIC-DUX4 has modified CIC transcriptional activity due to fusion of the DUX4 C-terminus and directly upregulates members of the polyoma enhancer activator 3 (PEA3) subgroup of the ETS transcription factor superfamily, ETV4, ETV1 and ETV5. Overexpression of PEA3 genes has been implicated in the carcinogenesis and tumour progression of multiple cancers. CRS arising in the head and neck is rare with a large seminal study reporting 12 of 111 CRS cases in this location.6Antonescu C.R. Owosho A.A.

This series was also compared to cases of ES in the head and neck, including extraskeletal sites, which were found to be more monotonous and lacked the mild nuclear pleomorphism, conspicuous nucleoli and focal component of heterogenous cell types characteristic of CRS. CRS was also shown to have diffuse nuclear WT1 reactivity and a lack of strong diffuse membranous CD99 staining in contrast to ES, as was observed in this case. Small round cell tumours in the head and neck present a diagnostic challenge and a wide range of differential diagnoses with overlapping histopathological features needs to be considered.8Reshma V. Kavita R. Priya N.S. et al.Small round cell tumour of the head and neck region: a review.Int J Oral Maxillofac Pathol. 2013; 4: 24-33Google Scholar CRS can be difficult to distinguish from undifferentiated carcinomas which are more common at this site, particularly in the minority of cases that show focal positivity for pan-cytokeratin.6Antonescu C.R.

The role of p16 immunohistochemistry, which is overexpressed in multiple high grade malignancies, has not been previously studied in CRS and warrants investigation. The solid variant of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma could also be considered at this age and location, however the lack of staining with myogenic markers excludes this diagnosis. The involvement of an adjacent lymph node raised the possibility of lymphoma which was inconsistent with negative lymphoid markers. Myoepithelial carcinoma and poorly differentiated synovial sarcoma can show morphological overlap with CRS but have contradictory immunohistochemical profiles. Ancillary genetic testing is required to confirm the diagnosis of CRS, however histopathological features are essential to guide such investigations. Despite a high degree of suspicion based on morphology and immunophenotype, FISH was negative for CIC as well as EWSR1 rearrangement in this case. CIC-DUX4 gene fusion was instead confirmed by whole genome/transcriptome sequencing. The rate of false negative FISH results with CIC break apart probes has been reported as 14%.11Yoshida A. Arai Y.

His father is hypertensive. He was conscious and alert, afebrile, and not pale; random blood sugar was 111 mg/dl; and blood pressure (BP) was 240/160 mmHg measured in the arm. Pulse was 98/min, weight was 66 kg, height was 1.67 m, and body mass index was 23.65 kg/m2. The cuff could not encompass the leg. He had a Grade 2 systolic murmur maximal at the apex. Fundoscopy, serum electrolytes, thyroid function, and chest radiograph were normal. Hemoglobin level was 12.9 g/dl and platelet count 178 × 103/ul. Urinalysis showed traces of protein, nitrites, and leukocytes. Total cholesterol was 149 mg/dl (0–200) and triglycerides 146 mg/dl (0–150). On the abdominal ultrasound scan, the kidneys measured 9.93 by 4.2 cm (right) and 10.78 by 4.89 cm (left). Corticomedullary differentiation was preserved and all other structures were normal. Computed tomography angiography showed calcification in the walls of vertebral, basilar, and middle cerebral arteries, mild cerebral atrophy, borderline infarctions, areas of luminal narrowing of the cavernous segment of the internal carotid artery, and intracranial atherosclerosis [Figure 1]. In the abdomen, the left renal artery had a fairly smooth outline, and the right renal artery had a smooth outline in the proximal aspect, but the distal part was irregular and poorly delineated. Intrarenal arteries were poorly delineated on both sides while post contrast imaging showed less uptake of contrast on the right kidney compared to the left [Figure 2]. Renal magnetic resonance angiography was not carried out.Figure 1: Computerized tomography of the brainFigure 2: Renal computerized tomography angiographyTwo-dimensional echocardiography showed concentric remodeling of the left ventricle. Electrocardiography showed left ventricular hypertrophy. Fasting cortisol and random cortisol levels were 128.24 (240–618) and 105.78 nmol/L, respectively. Other measurements are homovanillic acid 5.19 mg/24 h (1.4–8.8) and vanillylmandelic acid 5.67 mg/24 h (1.4–6.5). The working diagnosis was severe hypertension with intracranial atherosclerosis, with renovascular hypertension (renal artery stenosis) as a differential. He was given labetalol at 0.4 mg/kg/h (with a daily maximum of 300 mg) as a continuous infusion with BP monitoring quarter-hourly, with sublingual nifedipine 20 mg stat. Intravenous hydralazine (12 mg over 30 min) was given when hypertension persisted and twice daily S-amlodipine and 250 mg twice daily of methyldopa were added on the 3rd day. By the 5th day, symptoms had abated, but with the BP ranging around 190/120 mmHg lisinopril 10 mg daily and hydrochlorothiazide, 25 mg daily were added. He was discharged on the 2nd week on labetalol 400 mg tds, lisinopril 10 mg bd, metoprolol 50 mg bd, amlodipine 10 mg daily, and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily. A week later, with BP of 130/80mmHg, his medications were reduced to telmisartan 40 mg daily and amlodipine 5 mg, but after 1 week, his BP had risen to 190/120 mmHg. More antihypertensives were given as follows: alphamethydopa 250 mg bd, hydrochlorothiazide –amiloride 12.5/50 mg daily, metoprolol 50 mg daily and telmisartan 40 mg bd. Severe hypertension is uncommon in teenagers but more reports have been received in recent times.[1–3] As secondary causes of hypertension are more prevalent at earlier ages, the onus is on the physicians to pursue thorough investigations. The financial burden warrants that investigations be supported by insurance policies for all cases of childhood chronic disorders. Chronic disorders at young ages is associated with anxiety and depression and physicians are encouraged to address these, thereby encouraging compliance, and preventing complications. Fixed combination tablets and once daily dosing also helps compliance.[4] Renovascular hypertension was entertained, though it could not be conclusively established. In light of this, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone inhibitors should be used as in our patient, with alpha-blocker or beta-blocker, a long-acting calcium channel antagonist, and diuretics as additional medications. Drug combinations in our index patient would thus be regarded as appropriate. Statins and antiplatelet drugs have been recommended in this scenario.[5] Our patient came with headache and vomiting, which in the background of severe hypertension suggests hypertensive encephalopathy,[6] thereby justifying the use of parenteral antihypertensives. In the appropriate setting, hypertensive encephalopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion, after cerebrovascular accidents which are treated differently[7] are ruled out by imaging. Sublingual nifedipine was used at the presentation in our patient. The use continues to be commonplace despite controversies. While older publications have recommended its use, more recent data suggest an unacceptable adverse effect profile as well as insufficient efficacy.[8,9] An improper review of medications by an attending doctor led to the resurgence of severe hypertension. These patients should be always reviewed by a specialist at every clinic visit. Our patient also had features of target organ damage. This emphasizes the need for detection at earlier stages. This is a weakness of the health system and we recommend studies on cost -benefit system and annual health programs in the community.

This study aims to explore the success rate of non-surgical treatment of appendiceal abscess and assess the potential influence of an appendicolith on non-surgical treatment outcomes in children under 3 years old. Methods The clinical data of children under 3 years old who were diagnosed with appendiceal abscess at the Wuhan Children's Hospital, China, from February 2013 to May 2020 were collected. According to the findings of ultrasonography and CT imaging, they were divided into two groups, namely, the appendicolith group and the non-appendicolith group. Results A total of 94 children with appendiceal abscess were identified, meeting the specified study criteria, and categorized into two groups, namely, the appendicolith group ( n = 51, 54.3%) and the non-appendicolith group ( n = 43, 45.7%). Non-surgical treatment was unsuccessful in six out of the 94 children, yielding an overall success rate of 93.6% for non-surgical management of appendiceal abscess in children under 3 years old. The success rate for non-surgical treatment in the appendicolith subgroup was 90.2%, whereas that for the non-appendicolith subgroup was 97.7%. No statistically significant distinction was observed between the two groups ( P = 0.292). Likewise, there were no significant differences in gender, age, duration of symptoms, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, rebound pain, white blood cell count, C-reactive protein level, and abscess cross-sectional area between the appendicolith group and the non-appendicolith group. However, there is a statistical difference in tenderness in the right lower abdomen. Conclusion Non-surgical treatment of appendiceal abscess has a high success rate and can be considered an effective treatment strategy. In pediatric patients under 3 years old without evidence of complete intestinal obstruction or diffuse peritonitis, non-surgical treatment may be considered for appendiceal abscess.",en

Preoperative diagnosis was a neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas, for which anterior Radical Antegrade Modular Pancreatosplenectomy surgery (RAMPs) was performed. The postoperative histopathology showed features consistent with hyaline vascular type Castleman's disease. She had an uneventful surgical procedure and no serious postoperative complications.Pancreatic Castleman's disease is usually difficult to diagnose and there is no specific clinical manifestation to distinguish it from a neuroendocrine tumor. Even with radiological imaging it is very difficult to distinguish Castleman's disease from neuroendocrine tumors, and the preoperative imaging diagnosis may not match with the postoperative histopathological diagnosis. Treatment of CD is surgical resection and has a good prognosis. Partial resection and radiation therapy or observation alone is an alternative to complete surgical resection.Castleman disease of the pancreas sometimes mimics neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas.

Aspirin therapy after aspirin desensitization (ATAD) is the most extensively studied treatment paradigm for AERD. Objective: The objective was to identify which time point of ATAD was most predictive of long-term outcomes as measured by the 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22). Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients at a single institution who underwent endoscopic sinus surgery, followed by ATAD, and had remained on ATAD for 2 consecutive years. SNOT-22 scores were recorded at predesensitization as well as at the 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-month postdesensitization time points. The patients were separated into two cohorts at each of the data collection time points based on whether their SNOT-22 scores were &lt; 20 (responders) or ≥ 20 (nonresponders). Responder status was compared between each time point and at 24-month postdesensitization. The odds ratios (OR) were then calculated between the two groups at each of the following time points: postsurgery/predesensitization, and 3-, 6-, and 12-month postdesensitization. Results: There were 70 patients who met the inclusion criteria of having 24-month postdesensitization SNOT-22 scores available. Responder status at 6 months after surgery had the most predictive OR 16.5 (95% confidence interval, 3.71‐73.44) for long-term outcomes at 24 months. Conclusion: The SNOT-22 scores after 6 months of ATAD showed the greatest predictive value for long-term quality-of-life outcomes and, therefore, poor 6-month SNOT-22 scores could serve as a basis for consideration of alternative therapies.",en

We investigated the prognostic implication of early RF response on the timing of achieving disease control as defined by Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) low disease activity (LDA) or remission (REM) in patients with SDAI moderate or high disease activity (MDA/HDA) at baseline. We analyzed the first two years of each treatment segment; patients, who did not reach LDA/REM within two years, or patients who switched therapy within this time frame were censored in this Kaplan Meier analysis. In a Cox proportional hazard model we adjusted the observed effects for gender, age and disease duration, as well as for SDAI at month 3. <h3>Results</h3> RF response (as defined above) to treatment was observed in 11%, 25.5% and 41% of RF positive RA patients at 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment initiation, respectively; RF response was seen in comparable frequency in csDMARD and btsDMARD treated patients (Table 1). LDA or REM by SDAI in patients with MDA or HDA was achieved significantly earlier in RF responders as compared to non-responders (Wilcoxon p=0.042 for csDMARDs, p=0.005 for btsDMARDs). Crude effects of RF response on achieving LDA/REM were highly significant in the Kaplan Meier analysis (p&lt;0.0001; Figure 1) and remained so after adjusting for multiple variables including disease activity levels at 3 months (p&lt;0.0001); in a pooled analysis of all DMARD starts (N = 736), the adjusted Hazard Ratio (HR) for LDA or REM in the RF response group was 1.73 (95% confidence interval: 1.23 to 2.42), compared to the RF non-responders. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Change in RF levels or complete seroconversion at the 3-month timepoint predict the achievement and timing of treatment goals within a 6 to 24-month period after treatment initiation. This finding was independent of disease activity improvement at 3 months, and may therefore serve as an additional early biomarker in assessing a patient’s future chance of achieving treatment targets in RA. <h3>REFERENCES:</h3> NIL. <h3>Acknowledgements:</h3> NIL. <h3>Disclosure of Interests</h3> None Declared.",en

This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of mineralized plasmatic matrix (MPM) versus cancellous bone particles harvested from anterior iliac crest in secondary alveolar cleft grafting.This prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted on ten patients with unilateral complete alveolar cleft requiring cleft reconstruction. Patients were randomly divided into two equal groups; group (1) included 5 patients who received particulate cancellous bone derived from anterior iliac crest (control group) and group (2) included 5 patients who received MPM graft prepared from cancellous bone derived from anterior iliac crest (study group). All patients received CBCT preoperatively, immediately postoperatively and after 6 months. On the CBCT, graft's volume, labio-palatal width, and height were measured and compared.The outcome of the studied patients 6 months postoperatively showed that the control group had significant decrease in the graft volume, labio-palatal width, and height compared to the study group.MPM allowed for the integration of bone graft particles inside a fibrin network, which offers positional stability of the bone particles, thus preserving their shape with subsequent ""in situ"" immobilization of the graft components. This conclusion was reflected positively in terms of maintained graft volume, width, and height compared to that of the control group.MPM allowed for maintenance of grafted ridge volume, width, and height.",en

Adverse events after the Covid-19 vaccine vary widely, several studies have been carried out to look at the characteristics of AEFI after the Covid-19 vaccine. Several things still require study, one of which is the AEFI category for survivors and non-survivors. This study aims to describe the characteristics of post-vaccine adverse events, as well as the AEFI categories for survivors and non-survivors after the Covid-19 vaccine is given. The research design is descriptive with a cross-sectional research method. The research subjects were 128 people in the West Banten Region who had received the Covid-19 vaccine. The data were obtained by using Google-form which had been shared through WhatsApp groups. This research was conducted in December 2021. The data collection technique used in this study was random sampling. The results showed 8 respondents who complained of post-vaccine fever (6.3), 14 complained of dizziness after the vaccine (10.9), 31 complained of muscle pain (24.2), 2 complained of shortness of breath after getting the vaccine (1.2), 2 complained of nausea after getting the vaccine (1.6), and 4 complained of itching all over the body (3,4). The majority of research respondents experienced mild AEFI in both the survivors and the non-survivors. Information related to the lightness of AEFI after the covid vaccine is a mandatory consumption material that must be given to the community; besides that, it can also be used as a basis for the government to set policies.&#x0D; Keywords: AEFI, survivors and non-survivors, COVID-19 vaccine",en

Hypertension is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events (e.g. coronary heart disease, heart failure and stroke) and death. An international panel of experts convened by the International Society of Hypertension College of Experts compiled lifestyle management recommendations as first-line strategy to prevent and control hypertension in adulthood. We also recommend that lifestyle changes be continued even when blood pressure-lowering medications are prescribed. Specific recommendations based on literature evidence are summarized with advice to start these measures early in life, including maintaining a healthy body weight, increased levels of different types of physical activity, healthy eating and drinking, avoidance and cessation of smoking and alcohol use, management of stress and sleep levels. We also discuss the relevance of specific approaches including consumption of sodium, potassium, sugar, fibre, coffee, tea, intermittent fasting as well as integrated strategies to implement these recommendations using, for example, behaviour change-related technologies and digital tools.",en

We aimed to establish a relationship between brain iron dynamics and BBB function during childhood using a combined quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to depict both physiological systems along developmental trajectories.In this single-center prospective study, consecutive outpatients, 2-180 months of age, who underwent brain MRI (3.0-T scanner; Ingenia; Philips) between January 2020 and January 2021, were included. Children with histories of preterm birth or birth defects, abnormalities on MRI, and diagnoses that included neurological diseases during follow-up examinations through December 2022 were excluded. In addition to clinical MRI, quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM; iron deposition measure) and diffusion-prepared pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (DP-pCASL; BBB function measure) were acquired. Atlas-based analyses for QSM and DP-pCASL were performed to investigate developmental trajectories of regional brain iron deposition and BBB function and their relationships.A total of 78 children (mean age, 73.8 months ± 61.5 [SD]; 43 boys) were evaluated. Rapid magnetic susceptibility progression in the brain (Δsusceptibility value) was observed during the first two years (globus pallidus, 1.26 ± 0.18 [× 10- 3 ppm/month]; substantia nigra, 0.68 ± 0.16; thalamus, 0.15 ± 0.04).

Despite many treatment options available, the best surgical treatment is far from being established, and many patients will undergo several procedures before fistula closure is achieved. Gracilis muscle interposition, which is the transposition of the gracilis muscle into the rectovaginal septum, is an option for complex and persistent fistulas, but literature on the subject is scarce, mainly consisting of small case series. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the success rate of gracilis muscle interposition for the surgical treatment of rectovaginal fistula. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. STUDY SELECTION: Studies comprising at least 5 patients who underwent gracilis muscle interposition for rectovaginal fistula were included. No date or language restrictions was applied. INTERVENTION: Gracilis muscle interposition. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome is the fistula closure rate (%). Other domains analyzed are stoma closure rate, postoperative complications, quality of life, fecal continence, and sexual function. RESULTS: Twenty studies were included for a total of 384 patients. The pooled fistula closure rate for gracilis muscle interposition was 64% (95% CI, 53%–74%; range, 33%–100%). Risk factors for failure were smoking, underlying Crohn’s disease, and more than 2 previous repairs, whereas stoma formation was associated with improved outcomes. Postoperative complications ranged from 0% to 37%, mostly related to surgical site occurrences at the harvest site and perineal area. No deaths occurred. Gracilis muscle interposition improved quality of life and fecal continence, but impairment of sexual function was common. LIMITATIONS: Most of the included studies were small case series. CONCLUSIONS: Gracilis muscle interposition is a safe and moderately effective treatment that could be taken into consideration as second- or third-line therapy for recurrent rectovaginal fistula.

Some diabetic patients present with complaints of epigastric pain, vomiting, nausea, or postprandial fullness, however only a few have severe symptoms. Objective: To determine the frequency of dyspepsia among T2DM patients. Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed in Ziauddin Hospital Kemari Branch, Karachi, Pakistan after acquiring ethical approval from the hospital ethics committee. Short-Form Leeds Dyspepsia Questionnaire (SF-LDQ) was used to identify the presence of dyspepsia. Based on the sum of the frequency of symptoms, a cut-off value of 4 and above was used for the presence of dyspepsia. Results: A total of 368 patients were included in the study with a median age of 68.6 ± 14.2 years. The majority were females (62.8%). The mean duration of diabetes was 15 ± 10.4 years. The frequency of indigestion, heartburn, regurgitation, and nausea was 35.3%, 30.7%, 31.5%, and 11.4% respectively. Out of 368, 168 (45.7%) patients were found to have dyspepsia. The risk of dyspepsia was significantly lower among younger age, male gender, and patients having controlled glycemic status, patients doing physical activity twice a week, taking all three meals on time, and always having their breakfast early.

This raises the question of omitting prostate biopsy as prerequisite for therapy. Here, we present a prospective study of patients undergoing radical prostatectomy without prior biopsy, based on DRE, PSA, PSMA-PET and mpMRI. METHODS: Inclusion criteria were suspicious DRE and PSA value≥10 ng/ml, high suspicion of prostate cancer on mpMRI (PI-RADS 4/5) and high suspicion of prostate cancer on PSMA-PET imaging (CT or MRI). Between March 2019-August 2022, 27 patients were included into the study (Group 1). After filing for an amendment that allowed to omit PSMA-PET imaging, six more patients were included (Group 2). Outside of the study, radical prostatectomy without prior biopsy was performed in carefully selected cases, who did not meet the inclusion criteria. (n=17, group 3). Approved by the university clinic ethics committee (#19-693). RESULTS: Group 1: In histology, 7/27 patients had ISUP 2, 10/27 had ISUP 3, 5/27 had ISUP 4 and 5/27 had ISUP 5. 1/27 patients had local tumor stage of pT2a, 9/27 had pT2c, 9/27 had pT3a and 8/27 had pT3b. Group 2: In histology, 3/6 patients had ISUP grade 2, 1/6 had ISUP grade 3, 2/6 had ISUP grade 5. 1/6 patients had local tumor stage pT2a, 2/6 had pT2c and 3/6 had pT3b. Group 3: All patients had abornmal PSA level+DRE. Median PSA was 7.06 ng/ml (IQR: 5.9 - 8.5). Suspicion of prostate cancer based on abnormal mpMRI in 15/17 patients and abnormal PSMA-PET imaging in 15/17 patients. 13/17 had suspicion of prostate cancer in both modalities. In histology, 4/17 patients had ISUP 1, 9/17 had ISUP grade 2, 3/17 patients had ISUP 3 and 1/17 had ISUP 5. 3/17 patients had local tumor stage of pT2a, 12/17 had pT2c and 2/17 had pT3b. Group 1+2 showed a significantly higher rate of locally advanced prostate cancer compared to Group 3 (pT3a/pT3b: 60.6% vs. 11.8%, p<0.001). Group 1+2 showed a significantly higher rate of aggressive prostate cancer compared to group 3 (ISUP grade>2: 66.7% vs. 23.5%, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study approved by the ethics committee, it was shown that radical prostatectomy without prior biopsy can be done finding significant cancer in every single patient. Applying the strict inclusion criteria, histology showed a very high rate of locally advanced prostate cancer. More studies are needed to further improve the inclusion criteria for radical prostatectomy without prior biopsy.

https://openalex.org/W4377819931,2023,Medicine,"RAB27B expression in pancreatic cancer is predictive of poor survival but good response to chemotherapyBACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is the 4th leading cause of cancer-related death with poor survival even after curative resection. RAB27A and RAB27B are key players in the exosome pathway where they play important roles in exosome secretion. Evidence suggests that RAB27A and RAB27B expression not only leads to tumor proliferation and invasion, but also plays an important role in antigen transfer necessary for anticancer immunity. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we analyze the expression of RAB27A and RAB27B in patients after pancreatic cancer surgery with or without adjuvant chemotherapy and its influence on overall survival. METHODS: We analyzed a total of 167 patients with pancreatic cancer for their RAB27A and RAB27B expression. We dichotomized the patients along the median and compared survival in patients with high and low RAB27A and RAB27B expression with or without adjuvant chemotherapy treatment. RESULTS: We found a significant improvement in overall survival in patients with a negative resection margin (p= 0.037) and in patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy (p= 0.039). The survival benefit after chemotherapy was dependent on RAB27B expression status: only the subgroup of patients with high RAB27B expression benefited from adjuvant chemotherapy (p= 0.006), but not the subgroup with low RAB27B expression (p= 0.59). Patients with high RAB27B expression who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy showed a trend towards worse survival compared to the other subgroups. This difference was abolished after treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that RAB27B expression in pancreatic cancer might identify a subgroup of patients with poor survival who might respond well to adjuvant chemotherapy. If resectable, these patients could be considered for neoadjuvant chemotherapy to minimize the risk of not receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.",en

Methods We investigated 54 patients aged between 38 and 83 years, with DM (DM group) and without DM (control group), who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the facility between November 2006 and January 2021. We calculated the median apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) of the parotid glands in the control group and DM group. These groups were compared using the Mann–Whitney U tests. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to assess the ability of the ADC to predict DM. Statistical significance was set at p &lt; 0.05. Results The median ADCs of parotid grands in the control group and DM group were 0.83 × 10 −3 mm 2 /s and 0.74 × 10 −3 mm 2 /s, respectively ( p &lt; 0.01). ROC analysis revealed a cut‐off ADC value of 0.81 to distinguish between the control and DM group. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the ROC curve were 0.7, 0.67, 0.69, and 0.71, respectively. Conclusion The ADC was significantly higher in DM groups than in the control group.

https://openalex.org/W4319297646,2023,Medicine,"Electromyographic Evaluation of Muscle Activity in Patients Rehabilitated with Full Arch Fixed Implant-Supported ProsthesesBackground and Objectives: Implant rehabilitation of complete edentulous arches has become more and more popular because of the increased access of the population to this type of treatment. Furthermore, the development of new rehabilitation procedures can be applied in most clinical cases, including in those with severe atrophy. Hence, this study aimed to assess the functional changes that can occur in the stomatognathic system after implant rehabilitation procedures. Materials and Methods: A total of 63 patients were accepted in the study. They were divided into a first control (dentate) group (CG) and a second study group (edentulous, SG). For the latter, 30 patients received 204 two-stage implants immediately loaded with provisional prostheses. Surface electromyography (EMG) was assessed at the time of prostheses fixation, while for some patients it was applied six months after the fixation of the fixed prostheses, as well. These supplemental investigated patients formed a third, follow-up study group (FSG). All assessments were performed during the processes of clenching and mastication. The obtained data of the two study groups, SG and FSG, were compared with those of the control group, CG. Results: No statistical differences were found in the electrical muscular activity between the study and control groups during both clenching and mastication (p &gt; 0.05). In addition, there were no differences within the same study group, both initially and after 6 months. The only changes were noticed between static and dynamic values for the right masseter muscle in the follow-up group FSG (p = 0.008). Deviations of the overlapping coefficients were similar for all groups (p = 0.086): for CG, 20.5%, median 11.1 (min. 0, max. 104); for SG, 21.4%, median 12.2 (min. 0, max. 103); for FSG, 36.1%, median 26.9 (min. 0, max. 160). This revealed no neuromuscular adaption to the prostheses. Conclusions: Implant-prosthetic rehabilitation led to an EMG activity that was similar to that of dentate patients immediately after the placement of the fixed implant-supported prostheses. Moreover, the measured values did not change after six months of functioning for all evaluated parameters.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) on the development of peripheral and central symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in MRL/lpr mice. Methods. MRL/lpr mice were treated with taVNS for ten weeks, and the severity of both the central and peripheric symptoms was assessed. Results. taVNS activated tyrosine hydroxylase positive (TH + ) neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC), improved cognitive impairment, and alleviated depression-like behaviors. taVNS reduced the number of hippocampal microglia and protected the LC TH + neurons in MRL/lpr mice. Treatment with taVNS also retarded the development of lymphadenectasis and splenomegaly, decreased the proportion of double-negative T (DNT) cells, as well as alleviated nephritis and renal IgG deposition in MRL/lpr mice. However, when the LC TH + neurons were selectively lesioned, both peripheral and central therapeutic action of taVNS was eliminated. Finally, the results of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) indicated taVNS mainly LC-dependently reduced the concentration of norepinephrine and adrenaline in serum. Conclusion. This study provides direct evidence that taVNS can retard the development of peripheral and central symptoms of SLE, which may be related to its modulating the activity of LC TH + neurons. Our findings suggest that taVNS may be a potential non-invasive treatment approach for SLE, although further research is needed to explore its clinical applications in human patients.",en

The understanding of clinical management of AE has developed rapidly. However, the knowledge level of AE and barriers to effective treatment among neurologists remains unstudied. Methods We conducted a questionnaire survey among neurologist in western China on knowledge of AE, treatment practices, and perspectives on barriers to treatment. Results A total of 1113 neurologists were invited and 690 neurologists from 103 hospitals completed the questionnaire with a response rate of 61.9%. Respondents correctly answered 68.3% of medical questions about AE. Some respondents (12.4%) never assayed for diagnostic antibodies if patients had suspected AE. Half (52.3%) never prescribed immunosuppressants for AE patients, while another 7.6% did not know whether they should do so. Neurologists who never prescribed immunosuppressants were more likely to have less education, a less senior job title, and to practice in a smaller setting. Neurologists who did not know whether to prescribe immunosuppressants were associated with less AE knowledge. The most frequent barrier to treatment, according to respondents, was financial cost. Other barriers to treatment included patient refusal, insufficient AE knowledge, lack of access to AE guidelines, drugs or diagnostic test, etc. Conclusion Neurologists in western China lack AE knowledge. Medical education around AE is urgent needed and should be more targeted to individuals with less educated level or working in non-academic hospitals. Policies should be developed to increase the availability of AE related antibody testing or drugs and reduce the economic burden of disease.",en

Currently, patients with moderate to profound sensorineural hearing loss who get little benefit from hearing aids may be candidates for a cochlear implant (CI). The CI is a neural prosthesis that translates sound signals collected through an external microphone into electrical impulses delivered to the auditory nerve via an electrode array embedded in the cochlea. This technology has revolutionized the field of hearing restoration. Many patients benefit from CIs and display improved speech perception in favorable acoustic environments. Furthermore, early implantation in children leads to greatly improved language acquisition skills. This technology, however, is not perfect. Clinical outcomes are highly variable, and CI patients struggle in noisy environments. Furthermore, while CI patients can perceive rhythm, they have more difficulties discriminating complex tones associated with music and melodies. While CI technology has greatly improved since its inception, CIs are inherently limited by the spread of the electrical field from each electrode that contacts and activates a group of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). To circumvent this limitation oCIs are being developed that take advantage of laser stimulation to offer improved spatial and temporal resolution. Implementation of the strategy for hearing restoration involves the use of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors, injected into the ear, to express a photosensitive protein, typically a derivative of bacterial channelrhodopsin (ChR), in the SGNs. Expression of the photosensitive protein renders SGNs sensitive to optogenetic stimulation, which, thanks to novel, faster probes, enables faithful and improved frequency coding.3Dieter A.

The work from Zerche et al. aims to develop and validate a new compound, devoid of a fluorescent tag, to limit possible adverse effects that may result from the introduction of a non-human sequence. Unfortunately, removal of FPs renders ChRs less excitable.8Gauvain G. Akolkar H. Chaffiol A. Arcizet F. Khoei M.A. Desrosiers M. Jaillard C. Caplette R. Marre O.

As such, Zerche et al. replaced EYFP in f-Chrimson with a set of C-terminal modifications coupled with a self-cleaving P2A sequence, allowing expression of two separate proteins. Specifically, Zerche et al. took advantage of plasma membrane trafficking sequences of the human potassium channel Kir2.1, which they fused to the C-terminal end of f-Chrimson. They assessed different versions of the trafficking domain and demonstrated that a minimal sequence provides optimal photocurrent density. This new fusion partner is derived from a human protein and is less likely to induce immune response. Furthermore, it is significantly smaller than previously used FPs (EYFP: 717 bp vs. TSKir2.1: 60 bp), which is favorable when using AAV vectors with limited cargo capacity (∼4.7kb). Performance of the novel f-Chrimson-TSKir2.1 was assessed by injection of AAV2/9 vectors through the round window in postnatal P6-P7 mice and retroauricular insertion of a thin optical fiber into the scala tympani. Exposure to increasing light pulse intensity led to measurable optically evoked auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) at least up to 300 Hz with similar results for the new compound and f-Chrimson-EYFP. While spatial resolution can be improved with oCI, temporal fidelity, which is essential for auditory function, remains a challenge. Although photosensitive channels with fast kinetics can allow better temporal coding for high-frequency stimuli, they are associated with decreased light sensitivity. In terms of temporal fidelity, the kinetics of channel closure is similar for f-Chrimson-TSKir2.1-P2A-Katsuhka and f-Chrimson-EYFP (4.9 ms). While still quite fast, f-Chrimson is slower than other optogenes.5Bali B. Lopez De La Morena D. Mittring A. Mager T. Rankovic V. Huet A.T. Moser T.

One way to compensate for low light sensitivity is to induce higher expression of the optogene.10Gupta N. Bansal H. Roy S.

However, higher doses of the viral vectors led to SGN loss, indicating that over-expression of the optogene may be toxic. Additionally, Zerche et al. observed an apical/basal gradient of SGN transduction with lower percentages of SGNs transduced in the basal region. This is commonly seen in the inner ear, although new AAV vectors with improved efficacy are being developed to overcome this issue.11Andres-Mateos E. Landegger L.D. Unzu C. Phillips J. Lin B.M.

https://openalex.org/W4376131235,2023,Medicine,"Going through the fireMy maternal grandmother—my ah-bu—lives in Shanghai. Her dementia is worse. “The other day your ah-bu said to me, who will burn the silver for me on Qingming when I'm dead?” my mom's voice crackles through the car phone. It is that interstitial time of day, driving out from work where I am “doctor” and before getting home where I am “mama.” In the car I am unmoored from the questions and desires and demands of others; a place where the mind can wander. I imagine something similar happening in ah-bu's mind—starting to drift from our agreed-upon reality, setting out on its own journey to that place in between. “She says ghosts visit her,” my mom says, “asking her for money in the middle of the night, trying to steal her stuff.” I remember the last time I saw my grandparents 5 years ago. They were all shorter than I remembered, kyphotic spines folded further inward. I could feel the ridges of their vertebrae when I hugged them. How small they were under their clothes; how much air there was between their shirts and the surface of their skin. The giants of my childhood had gone; my childhood, too, had gone. “Have they taken her to see a geriatrician?” I ask, remembering the time I spent in the geriatrics clinic as a resident, struggling through the Montreal Cognitive Assessment with patients. What would ah-bu score now? My mom pauses, “No one back home believes psych meds work. Besides, Shanghai is still locked down. They're just dealing with it.” - - - The Qingming festival was the Chinese day of the dead, a day to sweep the tombs and honor the ancestors. Two things stand out in my mind about Qingming from childhood. First, when offering food to the dead, one must push the chopsticks straight down into the rice, so the sticks stand at attention, perpendicular to the lip of the bowl. It was as if spirits who came all this way for dinner could not be bothered to lift a chopstick laid flat. The second was that the living had to burn spirit money to ensure those on the other side had enough means to live comfortably in the afterlife. This is what ah-bu meant by burning the silver; we fed paper glazed with silver-tinted paint—joss money—into the fire. As a child, I helped ah-bu fold, crease, and puff the silver-tinted paper until they resembled the silver ingot, which was currency of Imperial China. We filled boxes with the joss money days ahead of time; the boxes would sit in the corner of the room, fermenting, waiting for the big night. Qingming night, I watched ah-bu go out onto the balcony alone, closing the door behind her. Behind the glass, I saw her shake out a mass of paper silver ingots into a chipped enamel basin. She reached in and lit the fire. The paper caught quickly, blackening at the corners, curling up and folding inward, burning gold and orange and red. It did not take long to burn. It all went up in a second, and then it was over, the whole box was gone. Afterwards it was only a pile of huddled ashes at the bottom of the basin, with the rare lip of red gleaming against black ash, and a trail of smoke going up into the night sky. Ah-bu and I looked out into the night, to see where the smoke went. - - - Mom, still on the car phone, tells me that Shanghai and other major cities have banned the burning of joss paper on Qingming. “The air pollution is bad enough without everyone burning a bunch of stuff,” mom says, “they found out it was horrible for the environment.” Later that night, I'm slicing a summer watermelon for my daughter. I hear the crack of the knife sliding splitting the rind, then the cold, sweet red-pink flesh opening to air. I remember watching ah-bu splitting the green rind with a cleaver, then wedging a spoon into the center to core out sweet, seedless heart of the watermelon for me. She would watch me eat, smiling, and making encouraging noises. I remember her standing in the kitchen frying fish—a favorite of mine. She wore arm protectors made from sleeves of older shirts, with elastic sewn into the wrist and elbow, to protect her skin from the splash of hot oil. She would shoo me from the kitchen, away from the spatter and crack of oil, to wait for dinner. Through cooking and feeding people, she showed love to the living. I think of her mind now, some memories and desires still stirring, like embers gleaming in the ash of papers that have been burnt. One day, when her memories are gone, I will be the last remaining, and not-entirely-reliable witness to all the ways she showed me her love for me. - - - As a child, watching the trail of smoke rising from the burnt offering into the night, I screwed up my eyes, as if doing so would help me see the ghostly hand reaching out of the night to take what was due. When I grew older and more skeptical, I started to wonder about the logistics. How many silver ingots for a year in the underworld? I would ask my mom. What's the inflation rate down there, anyway? And sure, you can send an iPhone over, but did they send a charger? What if they need tech support? Yet there was something about those nights during the Qingming Festival, watching the paper burn, As the smoke rose, so did something that felt like hope. Medicine can name pathology; it can treat disease. What we cannot cure we can palliate; we can diminish suffering. But watching that paper burn, I felt the hope that somewhere beyond my understanding there was a place where everything that had fallen apart came back together. By going through the fire, the silver paper would transform into the thing itself: true silver, heavy and cold in the hand, the spiritual currency of some unseen realm. It would become something you could buy dinner with, or clothes, or a house, by going through the fire. I imagined there would have to be an underworld vault to hold all the offerings. A central repository where everything sent over from our world was gathered, sorted, and sent on to their rightful owners. Someone had to be in charge of such an operation—perhaps a Goddess of Burning Things. She would sit in a dark room at the center of that vast hall, tending a small red-yellow fire in the middle of that room. All day and night, she watched for what came through the fire. Things that turned into ash in our world emerged, restored, in hers. Sometimes, out of her fire, piles of silver would come, and entire houses, and all the newest technology. She would bring them out of the flames. She would take careful notes of the name and the destination of the recipients; she also noted who sent them along. (She would have Franz Kafka's drafts, the 90% of what he had written which he carefully fed into the fire. Ralph Ellison's second novel, and Maxine Hong Kingston's, too, burnt up in house fires.) She could do more than try to repair what was broken, the way we do. She could turn back the clock. She would bring new vitality into the faded, burnt things; she would transform them into something new. One day in the future, I will ask my mom if we can burn the papers for ah-bu, to carry on the hope that somewhere out there, molecules of burnt things are put back together, with a little bit of the divine imbued.",en

Methods 118 patients prone to acute exacerbation of COPD (PAECOPD) and 92 patients with relatively stable COPD (SCOPD) were split into a training cohort (n=146) and a validation cohort (n=64). Radiomics features of the pectoral muscle (PM) were extracted from the cross-sectional image above the level of the aortic arch on the chest unenhanced multi-detector computer tomography (MDCT) images. We constructed a radiomics signature and calculated a radiomics score (Rad- score). Combination of Rad-score and clinical factors (including quantitative indicators of PM on MDCT) associated with PAECOPD, a radiomics nomogram was constructed with a multivariate logistic regression model. We evaluate the performance of the radiomics nomogram concerning discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness. Results The radiomics signature model was built with twelve features. The radiomics nomogram displayed better discrimination capability ( P &lt; 0.05) both in the training cohort (area under the curve(AUC), 0.932; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.891–0.973) and the validation cohort (AUC, 0.896; 95% CI, 0.816–0.975) compared with the clinical factor and radiomics signature, and displayed excellent calibration in the training cohort.

A meta- analysis was conducted to investigate the efficacy of azathioprine (AZA), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), rituximab (RTX), maintenance intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and tocilizumab (TCZ) in prevention of attacks in MOGAD. Methods English and Chinese-language articles published from January 2010 to May 2022 were searched in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane, Wanfang Data, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and China Science and Technology Journal Database (CQVIP). Studies with fewer than three cases were excluded. Meta-analysis of the relapse-free rate, the change of annualized relapse rate (ARR)and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores before and after treatment, and an age subgroup analysis was performed. Results A total of 41 studies were included. Three were prospective cohort studies, one was an ambispective cohort study, and 37 were retrospective cohort studies or case series. Eleven, eighteen, eighteen, eight, and two studies were included in the meta-analysis for relapse-free probability after AZA, MMF, RTX, IVIG, and TCZ therapy, respectively. The proportions of patients without relapse after AZA, MMF, RTX, IVIG, and TCZ were 65% [95% confidence interval (CI):49%–82%]), 73% (95%CI:62%–84%), 66% (95%CI:55%–77%), 79% (95%CI:66%–91%), and 93% (95%CI:54%–100%), respectively. The relapse-free rate did not significantly differ between the children and adults treated with each medication. Six, nine, ten, and three studies were included in the meta-analysis for the change of ARR before and after AZA, MMF, RTX, and IVIG therapy, respectively. ARR was significantly decreased after AZA, MMF, RTX, and IVIG therapy with a mean reduction of 1.58 (95%CI: [-2.29–-0.87]), 1.32 (95%CI: [-1.57–-1.07]), 1.01 (95%CI: [-1.34–-0.67]), and 1.84 (95%CI: [-2.66–-1.02]), respectively.

The pediatric population is particularly vulnerable to TB. Extrapulmonary manifestations of TB include cutaneous tuberculosis (CTB).There are 8 forms of CTB. Lupus vulgaris (LV) is the second most common form of pediatric CTB which presents nontender plaques or nodules with ulceration that progress to well-defined, scaly plaques. Tuberculous chancre results from exogenous inoculation and lesions contain large amounts of acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Clinically, tuberculous chancre presents as erythematous papules which form firm nontender ulcers. Tuberculosis verrucose cutis (TVC) presents as small papules surrounded by inflammation that develops into a wart-like lesion. Periorificial lesions are rare and present as painful ulcers in the oral or perineal regions. Scrofuloderma is the most common form of pediatric CTB and presents as nodules that ulcerate, forming purulent sinus tracts. Tuberculosis miliaris cutis disseminate presents as widespread papules and crusted vesicles. Metastatic abscesses present as multiple nodules that may ulcerate or form draining sinus tracts.

Other rare causes include ovarian hyperthecosis and Leydig cell hyperplasia. We present a rare case of hyperandrogenism with endometrial carcinoma, associated with increasing hirsutism and normal ovarian imaging and pathology. Clinical case: A 56-year-old woman G3P3 PM for 2 yrs, with Type 2 Diabetes, obesity, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, IBS, Factor S Leiden, menarche at age 12-13 yrs, and PCOS s/p laser HIR removal, and previous regular menses, was referred to endocrine clinic for increasing HIR with diffuse hair loss for 6 months and suprapubic/abdominal discomfort. She also had prior corneal melanoma treated with radiation and cardiac ablation for arrhythmia. Her paternal grandmother had uterine cancer. Physical Exam: VS BP=121/78; HR=66; BMI=31 Kg/m²: (Ferriman-Gallwey score 16/36) with HIR on face, abdomen, chest and back, but no other virilization or cushingoid signs. Initial labs: elevated total and free testosterone (59 ng/dl, n&amp;lt;45), (9.3 pg/ml, n&amp;lt;6.4) respectively, unconjugated DHEA (55 ng/dL, n 77-85) low DHEA-S (29 mcg/dl, n 35- 430 mcg/dl) 17-OHP (50 ng/dL, repeat 44 (n≤ 45) with normal prolactin (5.4 ng/mL, n 0.7-31.6) ACTH (7 pg/mL, n 0-47), salivary cortisol &amp;lt;0.03 mcg/dL, FSH (50.3 mIU/mL ;n=5.9-72.8), LH (29.7 mIU/ml, n 1.1-52.4), estradiol (21.71 pg/mL (n &amp;lt;11-32.2). CT abdomen-hepatic steatosis, normal adrenals. US- heterogenous mass uterine fundus 1.1 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm with subendometrial calcifications, subcm follicles in ovaries. MRI-hypoechoic 0.7X0.8X0.7 cm uterine lesion, normal ovaries; Endometrial biopsy-disordered proliferative endometrium. Hysteroscopy with biopsy confirmed grade I endometrial adenocarcinoma. A total laparoscopic abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy (TAH/BSO) was performed. Pathology-endometrial carcinoma, endometroid type F1GO stage 1A with positive estrogen and progesterone receptors, normal ovaries. By 3 months postop, the HIR significantly decreased with normalized total and free testosterone levels (14 ng/dl), (1.8 pg/ml). Conclusion: This is a rare case of hyperandrogenism associated with endometrial cancer in a postmenopausal woman causing hirsutism with the resolution of symptoms and normalization of androgen levels following TAH/BSO. Clinicians should be aware to thoroughly evaluate postmenopausal women who develop sudden increasing signs of androgenization, particularly if it is of recent onset, and consider other rare diagnoses.

https://openalex.org/W4384500558,2023,Medicine,"Brown Tumour in Chronic Kidney Disease: Revisiting an Old Disease with a New PerspectiveOsteitis fibrosa cystica (OFC) and Brown Tumour are two related but distinct types of bone lesions that result from overactivity of osteoclasts most often associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Despite their potential consequences, these conditions are poorly understood because of their rare prevalence and variability in their clinical manifestation. Canonically, OFC and Brown Tumours are caused by secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD. Recent literature showed that multiple factors such as hyperactivation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and chronic inflammation may also contribute to the occurrence of these diseases through osteoclast activation. Moreover, hotspot KRAS mutations were identified in these lesions placing them in the spectrum of RAS-MAPK-driven neoplasms, while until recently thought to be reactive lesions. Some risk factors contributed to the occurrence of OFC and Brown Tumour such as age, gender, comorbidities, and certain medications. The diagnosis of OFC and Brown Tumour includes clinical symptoms involving chronic bone pain and laboratory finding of hyperparathyroidism. In radiological imaging, the X-ray and Computed tomography (CT) scan could show lytic or multi-lobular cystic alterations. Histologically both lesions are characterized by clustered osteoclast in a fibrotic hemorrhagic background. Based on the latest understanding of the mechanism of OFC, this review elaborates on the manifestation, diagnosis, and available therapies that can be leveraged to prevent the occurrence of OFC and Brown Tumour.",en
https://openalex.org/W4385345118,2023,Medicine,"Serum Isthmin-1 is negatively correlated with HDL-C in type 2 diabetes mellitusIsthmin-1 (Ism-1) is a newly identified insulin-like adipokine that increases glucose uptake by adipocytes and inhibits hepatic lipid synthesis. Recent studies have shown that Ism-1 can improve the metabolic disorders associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and improve lipid metabolism. The classic function of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is to transport cholesterol from extra-hepatic tissues to the liver for metabolism. In contrast, disorders of lipid metabolism and inflammation are the leading causes of atherosclerosis (As). Atherosclerosis often manifests as loss of elasticity, lipid accumulation, fibrous tissue proliferation and calcium deposits in the affected arteries, eventually forming plaques.To illustrate the correlation between HDL-C and Ism-1 in T2DM, and the relationship between lipoprotein cholesterol and carotid plaque.A total of 128 patients with T2DM were enrolled in the study and basic information was collected. HDL-C levels were measured chemically. Serum Ism-1 levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Linear regression analysis was used to assess the correlation between serum Ism-1 levels and HDL-C in patients with T2DM. Basic information was again collected from 226 patients with T2DM. Independent sample t-tests were performed to explore the relationship between carotid plaque formation and lipids.HDL-C was divided into four groups according to quartiles and there was a between-group difference in Ism-1 (p = 0.040). Multivariable linear regression showed a negative association between Ism-1 and HDL-C in T2DM (β = -0.235, p < 0.001), even after adjusting for related factors (β = -0.165, p = 0.009). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and HDL-C showed significant differences between the carotid plaque group and the non-carotid plaque group (pLDL-C = 0.007, pHDL-C = 0.003).Serum Ism-1 and HDL-C are negatively correlated in T2DM. LDL-C is significantly higher in carotid plaque group than non-carotid plaque group, while HDL-C is significantly lower than in the non-carotid plaque group.",en
https://openalex.org/W4372271728,2023,Medicine,"Battlefield Acupuncture vs Ketorolac for Treating Pain in the Emergency DepartmentMany patients arrive in the emergency department (ED) with acute pain. Battlefield acupuncture (BFA) uses small, semipermanent acupuncture needles in 5 set points anatomically located on each ear to reduce pain in a few minutes. Pain relief can last months, depending on the pathology of the pain. At the Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical Center (JBVAMC) ED, ketorolac 15 mg is the preferred first-line treatment of acute, noncancer pain. In 2018, BFA was offered first to veterans presenting with acute or acute-on-chronic pain to the ED; however, its effectiveness in pain reduction vs ketorolac has not been evaluated in this patient population. The objective of this study was to determine whether BFA monotherapy was noninferior to ketorolac 15 mg for reducing pain scores in the ED.This study was a retrospective, electronic chart review of patients who presented to JBVAMC ED with acute pain or acute-on-chronic pain and received ketorolac or BFA. The primary endpoint was the mean difference in the numeric rating scale (NRS) pain score from baseline. Secondary endpoints included the number of patients receiving pain medications, including topical analgesics, at discharge and treatment-related adverse events in the ED.A total of 61 patients were included in the study. Baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 groups except for the average baseline NRS pain score, which was higher in the BFA group (8.7 vs 7.7; P = .02). The mean difference in NRS pain scores from baseline to post-intervention was 3.9 for the BFA group and 5.1 for the ketorolac group. The difference in reducing the NRS pain score between the intervention groups was not statistically significant. No adverse events were observed in either treatment group.For treating acute and acute-on-chronic pain in the ED, BFA did not differ compared with ketorolac 15 mg in NRS pain score reduction. This study's results add to the limited existing literature suggesting that both interventions could result in clinically significant reductions in pain scores for patients presenting to the ED with severe and very severe pain, indicating BFA could be a viable nonpharmacologic treatment option.",en

Also, to test reintubation percentage and post-operative complications in children. Methodology: This research is double-blind randomized control study with 68 children undergoing elective surgery requiring general anaesthesia with micro cuff tube. They were divided into 2 groups i.e. ETT size by USG (group U) and ETT size by age-based formula group A) (with 34 children in each. Both groups ETT measurement was calculated by independent Samples t-test, and correlation of both groups with actual ET Tube was measured by Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Reintubations or post-op complications was measured by Chi-squared test. Results: Mean age of group A and U are 5.65 ± 2.77 and 5.97 ± 2.77 respectively. Mean weights were from 13.5±2.06 kgs to 27±4.63kgs. Statistical significance with a P-value (P=0.0460) is observed in group U whereas no significance was seen in group A. A strong positive correlation (R=0.960) between USG-estimated ETT size and actual ETT size is observed. The difference in reintubations and post-op complications in group U were statistically significant with P &lt; 0.002.

CSM progresses insidiously with mild upper-limb numbness, which patients tend to ignore. As the condition worsens, the patients may experience a limp, limited fine motor activity, and eventually, a loss of daily activity. Conservative treatments, such as physical therapy and medication, are frequently ineffective for CSM. Once surgery is deemed to be required, decompression surgery is the best option. So far, both anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) and anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF) have been commonly used to treat CSM. In addition, a type of hybrid procedure that combines ACDF with ACCF has been used to treat some CSM cases and achieved satisfying results. Thus, this study aims to introduce this hybrid surgical technique and advocate for it based on its patient success.",en

Epidemiology is unknown. There are no well-established management guidelines. A review of clinical notes was undertaken along with review of literature.18-month-old female, born at 34 weeks with complex gastroschisis, duodenal and jejunal atresia needing silo reduction followed by laparotomy and duodenal jejunal anastomosis. She required parenteral nutrition (PN) for 2 months and was discharged at 3 months of age. She was lost to follow up and presented with anasarca, chronic diarrhoea, electrolyte imbalance, metabolic acidosis, failure to thrive and persistent hypoalbuminemia at 18 months. She received PN and attempts to feed her led to diarrhoea and hypoalbuminemia. Endoscopy revealed a no-fibrotic colonic stricture 50 cm from anal verge requiring dilatation. She received immunoglobulins for hypogammaglobulinemia. She was also noted to have persistent norovirus in her stools. A clinical diagnosis of protein losing enteropathy was made based on hypoalbuminemia and raised faecal alpha-1 antitrypsin (7.47 mg/g ww) however gastro-duodenoscopy was normal. She was trialled on modular feeds with low fat and medium chain triglyceride. Her genetic screen for R-15, R-33 panel were normal. Whole genome sequencing revealed GLMN variant associated with glomerular malformation. In view of persistently raised alpha-1 antitrypsin she underwent Magnetic resonance lymphangiogram which did not suggest any lymphatic anomalies. A double-balloon balloon enteroscopy revealed mid-jejunal lesions consistent with lymphangiectasia approximately 40 cm from the pylorus (see figure 1). This was confirmed on microscopic appearance (see figure 2). She was then commenced on sirolimus with a favourable response. Intestinal lymphangiectasia should be considered in context of diarrhoea, hypoalbuminemia and raised alpha-1 antitrypsin. Majority of the cases respond well to dietary modification. Small bowel resection may be needed. Radiological investigations alone cannot refute the diagnosis and luminal view is probably the best modality to rule out lymphangiectasia.",en

The immunomodulatory properties of this combination may salvage response to prior adoptive cellular therapy. We conducted a multicenter, open label, phase 1/2 study to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of len and nivo, and to assess the toxicity and preliminary efficacy of the combination in relapsed HL and LBCL. Methods: Adults with relapsed LBCL ineligible for autologous transplant (ASCT) or relapsed HL with ≥2 prior lines of therapy were eligible. Nivo 240 mg IV every 2 weeks for cycles 1–4 (28 day cycle) and 480 mg IV every 4 weeks beginning cycle 5 was given for up to 12 cycles. Len was given days 1–21 according to dose level (DL) and continued until progression. Results: Thirty-six patients signed informed consent and were treated, including 10 in the phase I cohort, 10 in the phase Ib HL cohort, and 16 in the phase II LBCL cohort. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) occurred in 2/4 patients at DL 1 (len 15 mg) and included grade 3 rash and grade 3 generalized weakness. Six patients were treated at DL -1 (len 10 mg) with no DLT and thus 10 mg len was selected as the RP2D. The most common adverse events (AE) included diarrhea (44%), rash (42%), and hypothyroidism (25%). Grade ≥3 AE included SARS CoV2 infection (11%), fatigue (8%), pulmonary embolism (3%), and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) (3%). Baseline characteristics for the phase Ib HL cohort included median age 28.5 (range 19–43), male sex in 9/10 patients, classical HL in 9 and nodular lymphocyte predominant HL in 1, prior brentuximab in 8/10, prior ASCT in 5/10, prior PD-1 inhibitor in 1/10, and a median of 3 prior treatments (range 2–9). The overall response rate (ORR) was 70% including 30% complete response (CR). The median progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were not reached (Figure). Two patients completed 12 cycles of nivo and remain on len treatment. In total 6 patients (2 from phase I and 4 from phase 1b) with HL underwent consolidative ASCT (n = 2) or allogeneic transplant (allo-HCT) (n = 4) directly following discontinuation of study treatment, and all 6 remain alive and relapse-free at data cut-off. For the phase 2 LBCL cohort, the median age was 62, 12/16 patients were male, 14/16 had prior CAR-T, and the median prior treatments were 4 (range 2–5). The ORR was 37%, including 12% CR.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms - Clinical Background: Myelofibrosis (MF) treatment (Tx) with Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors is limited by modest effects on bone marrow (BM) fibrosis & driver mutation allele burden. A high proportion of patients (pts) discontinue Tx due to cytopenias. GB2064, a LOXL2 inhibitor, is being developed as a potential disease-modifying Tx for MF. Aims: To evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) & clinical effects, specifically potential effects on BM collagen fibrosis, of oral GB2064 in pts with primary or secondary MF (PMF/SMF). Methods: MYLOX-1 (NCT04679870) is a phase II trial of oral GB2064 (1000 mg BID) administered in pts with PMF/SMF for 9 months, with follow-up 1 month after their last dose. Eligible pts were not allowed JAK inhibitors, had clinical laboratory parameters within protocol-defined limits & an ECOG performance status of 0–2. Primary endpoints: Safety & tolerability. Clinical visits occurred at protocol-specified timepoints: safety & tolerability, PK, PD & appropriate MF-specific assessments occurred at all visits except on Day (D) 7, D15 & Month (M) 4, when only safety & tolerability were assessed. BM biopsies & MRI of the spleen were performed at baseline & M3, M6 & M9. Pts who showed clinical benefit entered an extension phase & may continue Tx for an additional 3 years, during which only safety & tolerability are assessed. Results: As of early February 2023, 17 pts have been enrolled & started Tx (59% PMF); 10 JAK2 positive (3 with co-existing ASXL1 mutations, 1 with co-existing MPL & ASXL1 mutations), 2 MPL positive, 4 CALR positive (1 with co-existing EZH2 mutation) & 1 ASXL1 positive. JAK2 inhibitor status: 4 refractory, 8 intolerant, 2 ineligible, 3 naïve. Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System plus risk distribution: High for 2 pts, Intermediate-2 for 8, Intermediate-1 for 5 & Low for 2. Overall, 6 pts have completed Tx (2 are in the extension phase), 10 have discontinued Tx (6 due to adverse events [AEs], 3 due to disease progression) & 1 is continuing Tx. At the safety data cut-off (6 October 2022), all pts who received GB2064 experienced Tx-emergent AEs. Most were gastrointestinal in nature (11/16 pts), including nausea (6/16 pts) & vomiting (3/16 pts), & were either self-limiting or responded to anti-emetics. Serious AEs were experienced by 7 pts, 1 was Tx related (fall). Of 5 evaluable pts who received GB2064 for >6 months & had complete BM biopsy data, 1 (20%) showed improved ≥1-grade reticulin fibrosis, & 4 (80%) experienced a 1- or 2 grade reduction in collagen fibrosis (Figure). Spleen volume & hematological parameters remained stable from baseline to M6 for the 4 pts with BM collagen fibrosis response; none required transfusion. After M6 assessments, 2/4 pts progressed to the extension phase due to clinical benefit seen with GB2064 (1 experienced a total symptom score reduction >50% & the other an Anemia response). BM penetration by GB2064 was demonstrated through spatial distribution in M3 BM biopsies using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging. GB2064 showed good target engagement in plasma, with a 49.5% decrease in free LOXL2 from baseline to 2 hours post-dosing. Summary/Conclusion: Pts with MF who received GB2064 had an acceptable safety profile & improvements in BM reticulin & collagen fibrosis that indicated disease-modifying activity. GB2064 demonstrated BM penetration & good target engagement in plasma, thus may be a valid Tx option or disease-modifying combination agent for pts ineligible or intolerant to JAK inhibitors, or in combination with JAK inhibitors & novel therapies.

The study assessed Celecoxib's potential to mitigate the harmful impacts of sepsis on lung tissue. Methods: Thirty male Wistar albino rats, divided into three groups: a normal control group, a sepsis-induced group treated with saline, and a sepsis-induced group treated with Celecoxib. Sepsis was induced using fecal intraperitoneal injection (FIP), followed by a one-hour administration of Celecoxib at 50 mg/kg/day to the treatment group. Biochemical analysis of lung tissue measured oxidative stress markers (malondialdehyde [MDA]) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Tumor Necrosis Faftor-α [TNF-α]). Histopathological examination evaluated lung tissue damage, encompassing alveolar congestion, hemorrhage, inflammatory cell aggregation, and edema. Arterial blood gas analysis quantified partial oxygen (PaO2) and carbon dioxide (PaCO2) pressures. Results: Celecoxib-treated rats exhibited reduced oxidative stress markers with lower MDA levels, indicating decreased oxidative damage in lung tissue. Moreover, TNF-α and other pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly reduced in lung tissues of Celecoxib-treated rats, indicating its anti-inflammatory effects. Histopathological examination revealed reduced lung tissue damage in Celecoxib-treated rats, including alveolar congestion, hemorrhage, and inflammatory cell aggregation. Arterial blood gas analysis showed improved oxygenation (PaO2) in the Celecoxib-treated group compared to untreated sepsis rats. Conclusions: Celecoxib demonstrated preventive effects against sepsis-induced lung injury in rats by mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation, thereby preserving lung tissue integrity—further research, including clinical trials, to validate its effectiveness and safety in human sepsis management.",en

Lumbar arthrodesis is currently the most frequently performed surgical option for treatment due to the use of various approaches and techniques. The disease is characterized by low back pain, a clinical and public health problem, which in addition to having a socio-economic burden, severely affects functional status, quality of life (QoL), activity impairment, and health services. The study aims to investigate the benefits, in terms of pain, disability, andQoL, of lumbar arthrodesis surgery in patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis, at the latest follow-up.A systematic literature review registered in PROSPERO (ID: CRD42022379242), was conducted in the databases of: Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science. The key words used were as follows: ""spondylolisthesis"", ""arthrodesis"", ""degenerative"", ""quality of life"", ""pain"", ""patient reported outcome"", and ""disability"".A total of 26 articles were included. Significant differences were found between the preoperative and postoperative evaluation of the outcomes considered, in particular: pain (MD = -6.74; SD = 2.83; 95% CI: -8.01 to -5.46), low back pain (MD = -3.35; SD = 3.27; 95% CI: -3.61 to -3.10), lower limb pain (MD = -3.81; SD = 3.80; 95% CI: -4.10 to -3.51), disability (MD = -23.75; SD = 19.68; 95% CI: -25.26 to -22.23) and QoL (MD = 0.21; SD = 0.24; 95% CI: 0.19 to 0.23).The results show significant improvement in all measured variables, demonstrating that there are different surgical treatments to cure degenerative spondylolisthesis. However, residual pain impacting the QoL remains, regardless of the technique used. Therefore, the development of personalized pain management for patients with residual chronic pain is indicated.",en
https://openalex.org/W4320033135,2023,Medicine,"Association between congenital heart disease and parenteral nutrition–associated liver disease in neonates: A retrospective cohort studyAbstract Objective Infants receiving parenteral nutrition (PN) are at increased risk of PN‐associated liver disease (PNALD), which can lead to hepatic fibrosis. Congenital heart disease (CHD) represents a risk factor for hepatic fibrosis, so this study sought to better understand whether infants with CHD were at elevated risk of PNALD when receiving long‐term PN. Study Design This study includes a retrospective cohort of infants at a level IV neonatal intensive care unit from 2010 to 2020 who received long‐term PN during the first 8 weeks of life. A time‐varying Cox survival model was used to model risk of PNALD between infants with and without CHD, adjusted for demographics, surgical intervention, and PN exposure, using a 5000‐iteration bootstrap estimation. Secondary analyses evaluated risk against discrete CHD diagnoses, and sensitivity analysis was performed on the magnitude and quantity of direct bilirubin laboratory measurements making up the PNALD definition. Results Neonates with CHD were found to be at higher risk for PNALD during or soon after long‐term PN exposure. A pattern of increasing association strength with increasing bilirubin threshold suggests infants with CHD may also experience higher degrees of injury. Conclusions This work offers a step in understanding how diagnoses can be factored into neonate PN prescription. Future work will explore modifications in lipid profiles and timing to mitigate risk in patients with CHD.",en

Data were analysed using a one-way covariance analysis test Results: Of the 256 individuals assessed, 42(16.4%) met the inclusion criteria, and, of them, 30(71.4%) comprised the final sample; 10(33.3%) males and 20(66.6%) females. Overall, 19(63.3%) patients were aged &gt;50 years, and duration of diabetes was 5-10 years in 23(76.7%) cases. There were 15(50%) patients in each of the two groups. There was significant difference in the mean scores of all dimensions of self-care behaviour between the groups, and it increased significantly in group A post-intervention (p=0.05). There was a significant decrease in fasting and 2-hour postprandial glucose levels in group A compared to group B post-intervention (p=0.001). Conclusion: The application of the nursing agency model was found to be effective in increasing self-care ability and in reducing fasting and 2-hour postprandial blood glucose levels.

Methods Using deidentified electronic health record data, we conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study involving individuals with documented ASCVD who had received statin treatment for at least 3 months across China. The primary outcomes assessed encompassed all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and non-cardiovascular mortality. Relationships between post-treatment LDL-C concentrations and outcomes were evaluated using restricted cubic spline (RCS) curves based on Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. Additionally, competitive risk models were employed to explore associations between LDL-C levels and cause-specific mortality. Results Among 33,968 participants, we identified nearly linear associations of post-treatment LDL-C level with all-cause mortality and CV mortality during a median follow-up of 47 months. Notably, patients who achieved the recommended target of LDL-C (&amp;lt;1.4 mmol/L) were at significant lower risks of all-cause mortality (HR, 0.77; 95%CI, 0.69-0.86) and CV mortality (sHR, 0.68; 95%CI, 0.58-0.79), compared with those with LDL-C ≥ 3.4 mmol/L. This survival benefit was consistent in patients with different intensity of LDL-C reduction and other subgroup analyses. And no correlation was found between post-treatment LDL-C concentration and non-CV mortality. Conclusions Our findings supported the safety of currently recommended target of LDL-C control and the “lower is better” principle in patients with ASCVD.",en

Therefore, if a patient with pemphigus vulgaris presents with bilateral lower extremity edema or proteinuria detected during urinalysis, it could indicate involvement of the kidneys.Pemphigus vulgaris is a type of autoimmune blistering disease characterized by the presence of IgG autoantibodies against desmogleins 3 and 1. It is important to evaluate potential autoimmune associations in patients with pemphigus vulgaris so that appropriate laboratory and physical examinations can be performed to monitor for any increased risk of other autoimmune disorders. This case report describes a 55-year-old woman who presented with oral and axillary erosions, which were diagnosed as pemphigus vulgaris based on skin histopathology and immunofluorescence. During follow-up, the patient was found to have proteinuria, which led to referral to a nephrologist. The patient was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome and minimal change disease after a biopsy. Despite treatment, the patient's proteinuria persisted and serum creatinine levels increased, leading to a second biopsy which confirmed the diagnosis of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. This study reports on the first case of pemphigus vulgaris with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and reviews the literature on the co-occurrence of acquired immunobullous diseases and nephrotic syndrome of any kind.",en

As CheckMate 743 was therapeutic trial in selected MPM patients (pts), additional data would be of interest to confirm the results in real-life setting. Methods: The present multicenter, retrospective study assessed the outcomes of NIVO+IPI, via an early access program (EAP) in France, in pts with treatment naïve unresectable MPM. The primary objective was investigator-assessed real world progression-free survival (rwPFS) from initiation of NIVO+IPI, defined as time from first dose of NIVO+IPI to first documentation of objective disease progression or death from any cause. The secondary objectives were real world OS (rwOS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety of NIVO+IPI combination. Results: From April 1, 2021 to Feb 15, 2022 (last day of EAP) there were 143 pts included out of 350 pts treated by EAP for unresectable MPM in 44 centers. Population characteristics are described in the table. With a median follow-up of 14.1 months, median rwPFS was 7.8 months (95%CI 6.2-9.5). rwPFS rates no differ according to histological subtypes: rwPFS for epithelioid MPM was 8.1 months (95%CI 6.0-12.6) and 7.4 months (95% CI 5.3-11.2) for other histological subtypes. The median rwOS was not reached (NR), 1-year survival rate was 65% (95% CI 57-75%). Median rwOS was NR and 13.1 (95% CI 7.8- NA) in epithelioid and non-epithelioid MPM, respectively. At 1 year, 71.2% of pts with epithelioid MPM are still alive versus 51.2% in pts with other histological subtypes. ORR was 23.9% (95% CI 16.9-32.0%) with median time to response of 3.68 months (2.33-5.09) after introduction of NIVO+IPI. Disease control rate was 80.4%. Grade 3-4 adverse events (AE) occurred in 37.8%. Severe immune-related AE occurred in 13.9% of patients. Five deaths were associated with treatment-related AEs according to investigators judgment. Conclusions: While pt’s characteristics differed from the pivotal trial, notably with older and unselected patients, efficacy outcomes that we observed here compares favorably with CheckMate 743 results. Tolerance looks acceptable in real-life setting despite 5 toxic deaths reported. Extended follow-up of our cohort will allow consolidation of the results. Clinical trial information: NCT05308966 .

For this purpose we searched the electronic database of PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science for studies published in the last 30 years in this field. The conclusions of this review are: patients with stable coronary artery disease on optimal treatment and in a good physical condition can tolerate traveling to high altitude up to 3500 m; on the other hand, patients with unstable angina or recent myocardial infarction no older than 6 months should take less interest in hiking or any activity involving high altitude. Air-traveling is contraindicated for patients with myocardial infarction within previous 2 weeks, angioplasty or intracoronary stent placement within previous 2 weeks, and unstable angina or coronary artery bypass grafting within previous 3 weeks. The main trigger for sudden cardiac death is the lack of gradual acclimatization to high-altitude and to the exercise activity, and the most important risk factor is prior myocardial infarction.",en

The tibial nutrient artery (TNA) is the main diaphyseal artery nurturing the tibial shaft. The objective is to investigate the impact of TNA canal (TNAC) injury on the development of atrophic, oligotrophic, and hypertrophic nonunion in patients with tibial shaft fractures.Between January 2010 and December 2020, patients with a nonunion of a tibial shaft fracture were retrospectively included. Two readers independently evaluated the integrity of the TNAC and classified nonunion type. A multinomial regression model was utilized to evaluate if a TNAC injury has an impact on the type of nonunion.From an initial set of 385 patients with the diagnosis of a nonunion of the lower leg, a total of 60 patients could be finally included in the study. Most patients were males (78%), diabetic (95%), smokers (73%), and had an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score of 2 (72%). TNAC injury was noted in 24 patients (40%): an iatrogenic TNAC injury was observed in 13 (22%) patients, a traumatic TNAC injury in 11 (18%) patients. Most patients had a hypertrophic nonunion (29 patients (48%)), followed by an oligotrophic nonunion (24 patients (40%)) and lastly an atrophic nonunion (seven patients (11%)). The multinomial regression model showed that there was no impact of TNAC injury on the development of a specific type of non-union (p = 0.798 for oligotrophic vs. atrophic nonunion; p = 0.943 for hypertrophic vs. atrophic nonunion). Furthermore, patients were about four times more likely to develop an oligotrophic/hypertrophic nonunion rather than atrophic one (odds ratio 3.75 and 4.25, respectively), regardless of the presence of a TNAC injury.In the evaluated patient cohort with tibial shaft fractures, we could not find a statistically significant association between TNAC injury and type of nonunion. However, patients were almost four times more likely to develop oligotrophic or hypertrophic nonunion rather than an atrophic one although common risk factors for impaired (micro)vascular blood supply were highly prevalent in the study group. Multicenter studies with a larger number of atrophic nonunions are warranted to further evaluate this result.",en
https://openalex.org/W4387751443,2023,Medicine,"S3521 Apixaban Failure in Idiopathic Budd-Chiari SyndromeIntroduction: Primary Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is a rare disease characterized by hepatic venous obstruction resulting from thrombosis and often associated with other syndromes with hypercoagulability. Approximately 20% of cases are deemed idiopathic after extensive evaluation for prothrombotic disease. Here we present a challenging case of BCS refractory to apixaban. Case Description/Methods: A 35-year-old with history of myocarditis presents with a 1 week history of abdominal pain. Vitals were stable. Labs were notable for total bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL, AST/ALT of 112/245, and ALP of 110 U/L. Abdominal doppler ultrasound revealed occlusive thrombosis of the hepatic vein and IVC (panels A, B). Patient was started on heparin and underwent catheter directed thrombolysis, followed by IVC thrombectomy with stent placement (panels C, D, E). Workup for autoimmune, acquired/inherited thrombophilia (APLS, JAK2, V617F, Exon 12, CALR, MPL), and an extended genetic analysis panel were all negative. Patient was discharged on indefinite apixaban. 3 months later, patient was readmitted for progressive hepatic vein thromboses with in-stent restenosis resulting in acute liver failure, SMV thrombosis, and colonic ischemia with 3 exploratory laparotomies. Direct Xa inhibitor levels were within therapeutic range. Patient underwent multiple rounds of thrombectomies, angioplasties and ultimately a TIPs. Apixaban was supplanted by low molecular weight heparin and is doing well since discharge. Discussion: BCS is a rare disease with a prevalence of 1 case per 1 million persons/year and a high mortality of >80% at 3 years. Early disease recognition with restoration of hepatic venous outflow is crucial. Patients are initiated on anticoagulation, typically with a vitamin K antagonist or low molecular weight heparin. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) appear safe in retrospective studies. Given lack of studies, it is unknown if patients with idiopathic disease have an earlier timing to progression of disease (complicated by recurrent thromboses, development of cirrhosis) than those with known prothrombotic disorders, despite the use of long-term anticoagulation. In this case, BCS was recognized early, and the patient quickly underwent mechanical thrombectomy, stenting, and indefinite apixaban. However, the patient did not respond to apixaban. Further prospective studies on the use of DOACs and comparing its use on those with myeloproliferative/prothrombotic disorders vs those with idiopathic disease should be explored.Figure 1.: A, B: Abdominal doppler ultrasound depicting thrombus in IVC, hepatic vein; C, D, E: IR venogram with stent and angioplasty.",en

We assessed the number of children with empyema in which video assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) could be avoided in a centre where standard therapy is drainage using a chest drain with/without intrapleural fibrinolytics. We included all children referred for chest drainage of a pleural effusion to RadboudUMC between January 2022 and April 2023. Children were referred in case of pneumonia with respiratory distress and suspected pleural effusion on the chest X-ray or an effusion size &gt;20mm in the chest ultrasound, indicating the need for chest drainage or VATS. We analysed symptoms, test results, and treatment. Thirty-three children aged 0-16 years were referred for treatment of pleural effusion. Most children presented with fever, cough, and dyspnoea (72%). Four children presented with abdominal pain (13%), which led to 2 appendectomies prior to referral. In 11(33%) children an invasive group A streptococcus was cultured from the pleural fluid. All patients were treated with antibiotics. One patient received VATS primarily. 27(84%) patients received a chest drain and four patients continued conservative treatment. 14(52%) of the 27 children with a chest drain were treated with intrapleural fibrinolytics (i.e. alteplase or urokinase) because of persistent pleural effusion on ultrasound despite chest drainage. No side effects were observed. Two patient received VATS secondary to chest drainage without receiving prior intrapleural fibrinolytics. Intrapleural fibrinolytic treatment appeared safe and could avoid VATS in children with poor chest drainage and is therefore a useful minimal invasive treatment in children with pleural empyema.",en

It has been reported that hyperglycemia was a crucial risk factor for renal IRI in diabetes patients with renal IR-induced AKI. Whereas there is no effective treatment. Here, we explored the nephroprotective effects of combination of Astragaloside II and Notoginsenoside Fc on diabetes with IR-induced AKI and its potential mechanisms. We established hyperglycemia with renal hypoxia reoxygenation (H/R) injury model in vivo and in vitro. We first found that combination of Astragaloside II and Notoginsenoside Fc could improve biochemical indexes and renal histologic injury in model mice. We provided relevant evidence that combination of Astragaloside II and Notoginsenoside Fc significantly reduced apoptosis level. In addition, our data suggested that combination of Astragaloside II and Notoginsenoside Fc could have inhibited effects on oxidative stress and NLRP3 activation, further suppressing inflammatory cell aggregation and inflammatory factor secretion. Further studies found that the combination of Astragaloside II and Notoginsenoside Fc could prevent SHP-1-induced VEGF inhibition and activate PDGFB to ameliorate renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) function. In conclusion, our study indicated that combined treatment of Astragaloside II and Notoginsenoside Fc exerted beneficial protective effects on renal tubular injury and mitochondrial oxidative stress in diabetes with ischemia-reperfusion induced AKI via activating PDGFB and inhibiting SHP-1/VEGFA signaling pathway. Therefore, combination of Astragaloside II and Notoginsenoside Fc may be a potential therapeutic strategy to treat diabetes with IR-induced AKI.",en

Although some studies have shown that the prognosis of GBPA patients is significantly better than that of gallbladder adenocarcinoma (GBA) and gallbladder mucinous adenocarcinoma (GBMA) due to its rarity, there is a lack of large sample studies necessary to confirm the clinical characteristics and survival rate of GBPA. Therefore, this study aimed to describe the clinicopathological characteristics affecting survival in GBPA. This data was then used to establish a prognostic nomogram for GBPA. Methods The data of patients diagnosed with gallbladder cancer between 2004 to 2015 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The clinical features and survival of patients with GBPA were compared with those of GBA and GBMA after balancing the baseline characteristics using propensity score matching (PSM). Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were used to identify the prognostic factors for GBPA. Subsequently, the overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) nomograms were established to predict GBPA prognosis. The performance and discrimination of the nomogram were measured using concordance index (C-index), calibration curves, receptor operating characteristic curves(ROC), and decision curve analysis (DCA) was applied to examine the net benefit of tients with GBPA, 5798 patients with GBA, and 223 patients with GBMA. The mean 1-, 3- and 5-year OS rates for GBPA were 81.3%, 58.8%, and 49.1%, respectively, while the mean 1-, 3- and 5-year CSS rates were 85.0%, 68.1%, and 61.0%, respectively. The median OS rates was 58 months (95% CI: 43–88), while the median CSS was not reached. The PSM analysis showed a differ statistically significantly in the OS between GBPA and GBA. However, there has no statistically difference in CSS. Conversely, the OS and CSS between GBPA and GBMA have statistically significant differences. Age, marital, T stage, and M stage were strongly linked to the prognosis for OS, while T-stage, M-stage, and surgery were significantly associated with the prognosis for CSS in GBPA patients. The AUC for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS were 0.722 (95%CI: 0.630-0.813), 0.728 (95%CI: 0.665-0.790), and 0.706 (95%CI: 0.641-0.771), respectively. The AUC for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year CSS were 0.749 (95%CI: 0.659-0.840), 0.698 (95%CI: 0.627-0.770), and 0.665 (95%CI: 0.594-0.735), respectively. The C-indices for the OS and CSS nomograms were 0.701 (95% CI: 0.634-0.744) and 0.651 (95% CI: 0.598-0.703), respectively. The calibration curves showed that the nomograms were well consistency. The DCA showed that compared with the TNM system, the nomogram models had a significant positive net benefit in survival prediction. Conclusion GBPA has distinct clinicopathological characteristics and survival compared to other gallbladder carcinomas. The established nomogram provided a better prediction of survival for GBPA patients than the traditional TNM models.",en

However, there is still controversy about whether implant materials need to be removed. At present, the research on this topic is still lacking at home and abroad. Therefore, in this study, the patients undergoing removal of internal fixation for rib fractures in our department within one year were followed up, to statistically analyze implant-related complications, postoperative complications and postoperative remission rate.A retrospective analysis was conducted on 143 patients undergoing removal of internal fixation for rib fractures from 2020 to 2021 in our center. The implant-related complications, postoperative complications and postoperative remission rate of patients with internal fixation were analyzed.In this study, a total of 143 patients underwent removal of internal fixation, among which 73 suffered from preoperative implant-related complications (foreign-body sensation, pain, wound numbness, sense of tightness, screw slippage, chest tightness, implant rejection), and 70 had no post operative discomfort but asked for removal of internal fixation. The average interval between rib fixation and removal was 17 ± 9.00 (months), and the average number of removed materials was 5.29 ± 2.42. Postoperative complications included wound infection (n = 1) and pulmonary embolism (n = 1). of the 73 patients with preoperative implant-related complications, the mean postoperative remission rate was 82%. Among the 70 patients without preoperative discomfort, the proportion of discomforts after removal was 10%. No perioperative death occurred.For patients with internal fixation for rib fractures, removal of internal fixation can be considered in the case of implant-related complications after surgery. The corresponding symptoms can be relieved after removal. The removal presents low complication rate, and high safety and reliability. For patients without obvious symptoms, it is safe to retain the internal fixation in the body. For the asymptomatic patients who ask for removal of internal fixation, the possible risk of complications should be fully informed before removal.",en

Chronic inflammation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of thrombotic events in patients with IBD. However, many unresolved questions remain, particularly regarding the mechanisms that determine the persistent inflammatory state independent of disease activity. This review explored the role of gut microbiota dysbiosis and intestinal barrier dysfunction, which are considered distinctive features of IBD, in determining pro-thrombotic tendencies. Gut-derived endotoxemia due to the translocation of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from the intestine to the bloodstream and the bacterial metabolite trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) are the most important molecules involved in gut dysbiosis-related thrombosis. The pathogenic prothrombotic pathways linked to LPS and TMAO have been discussed. Finally, we present emerging therapeutic approaches that can help reduce LPS-mediated endotoxemia and TMAO, such as restoring intestinal eubiosis, normalizing intestinal barrier function, and counterbalancing the effects of LPS and TMAO.",en

Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of medical multimorbidity (≥2 chronic medical diseases), substance use disorders (SUDs), and mental illness among CLS-involved veterans aged 50 and older. Research Design: Using Veterans Health Administration health records, we estimated the prevalence of mental illness, SUD, medical multimorbidity, and the co-occurrence of these conditions among veterans by CLS involvement as indicated by Veterans Justice Programs encounters. Multivariable logistic regression models assessed the association between CLS involvement, the odds for each condition, and the co-occurrence of conditions. Subjects: Veterans aged 50 and older who received services at Veterans Health Administration facilities in 2019 (n=4,669,447). Methods: Mental illness, SUD, medical multimorbidity. Results: An estimated 0.5% (n=24,973) of veterans aged 50 and older had CLS involvement. For individual conditions, veterans with CLS involvement had a lower prevalence of medical multimorbidity compared with veterans without but had a higher prevalence of all mental illnesses and SUDs. After adjusting for demographic factors, CLS involvement remained associated with concurrent mental illness and SUD (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 5.52, 95% CI=5.35–5.69), SUD and medical multimorbidity (aOR=2.09, 95% CI=2.04–2.15), mental illness and medical multimorbidity (aOR=1.04, 95% CI=1.01–1.06), and having all 3 simultaneously (aOR=2.42, 95% CI=2.35–2.49).

Nutritional status assessment is usually performed by paediatricians by using anthropometry (body mass index, weight to height indices) and/or by body fat-mass measurement (bioimpedance analysis, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, computer tomography, etc.). Parents are also interested in but usually fail to evaluate their child’s nutritional status. To help the sufficient collaboration between the physician and parents a new nutritional status monitoring method is developed for families. The new monitoring system was developed under a paediatrician’s supervision by considering national and international recommendations, references as well as the anthropometric measurement possibilities at home. The model requires age, sex, body mass, height, waist circumference and hand circumference as predictor (input) variables of nutritional status, while (1) the centile values of the measured body dimensions, (2) body fat percentage and the centile of body fat percentage, (3) the nutritional status category (undernutrition, normal nutritional status, overfat/obese) can be predicted (outcome variables) by the new method. The predictive accuracy of the model for nutritional status category was 94.88% in boys and 98.66% in girls. The new model was developed for nutritional status assessment in school-aged children and will be incorporated in the healthy lifestyle module of ‘Teenage Survival Guide’ educational package to be developed by the Health Promotion and Education Research Team, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Hungary. The new monitoring system could help the families to identify the early signs of malnutrition in children.

The patient’s oxygen saturation levels suddenly dropped, and the CT scan identified bilateral peripheral consolidation areas in both lungs, consistent with septic emboli. These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of Lemierre syndrome. The patient was treated with 2 weeks of intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin, as well as anticoagulation therapy using heparin, and her symptoms resolved completely. Conclusion This report presents an unusual occurrence of Lemierre syndrome caused by K. pneumoniae , a less frequently encountered causative pathogen in patients without diabetes mellitus. The case highlights the significance of timely and appropriate antibiotic use to prevent potential complications.",en

https://openalex.org/W4362717574,2023,Chemistry,"Development of pH shift bicarbonate buffer dissolution test using floating lid and its feasibility for evaluating enteric-coated tabletThe purpose of the present study was to develop a pH shift bicarbonate buffer (BCB) dissolution test using a floating lid and investigate its feasibility for the evaluation of enteric-coated (EC) tablets. Rabeprazole EC tablets (one branded and 7 generic products) were employed as model formulations. In the pH shift BCB dissolution test, a floating lid was used to avoid an increase in pH due to CO2 evaporation (JDDST 2021 (63), 102447). An HCl solution (0.01 N, pH 2.0, 500 mL) was first added to a compendial dissolution vessel. The solution surface was then covered by a floating lid. After 1 h, a concentrated bicarbonate solution (50 mL, 110 mM, pH 9.5) was added to shift the pH value to pH 6.5 (final bicarbonate concentration: 10 mM). Dissolution tests were also performed in BCB without the pH shift and in a phosphate buffer (PB). After the pH shift, the pH value was maintained at pH 6.5 ± 0.1 for 5 h. During the acidic pH stage, the EC tablets did not disintegrate except for one generic tablet. At pH 6.5 after the pH shift, the average disintegration time was 49 ± 26 min (N = 8), which roughly corresponded to the clinical Tmax. However, a quantitative in vitro - in vivo correlation about Tmax was not observed probably because of a large variation in Tmax. Pre-exposure to the acidic pH environment did not affect the disintegration time. In BCB, the dissolution profiles showed a large variation among the drug products. In contrast, in PB, all tablets rapidly disintegrated (13 ± 4 min (N = 8)). These results are in good agreement with the previous study using the CO2 gas bubbling method. Since the pH shift BCB dissolution test using a floating lid is easy, low-cost, and compatible with the compendial paddle dissolution test apparatus, it would be useful in practical formulation development.",en

The 2-methyl-3-furanthiol was produced via HMF from 2,3-enolization reaction in the cysteine-ribose reaction. The 3-thiophenethiol carbon atoms came mostly from cysteine and partly from ribose, which was first confirmed from both the cysteine Strecker degradation and Maillard reaction.

We have been searching for symmetric H-bonds by using the NMR technique of isotopic perturbation. Various dicarboxylate monoanions, aldehyde enols, diamines, enamines, acid-base complexes, and two sterically encumbered enols have been investigated. Among all of these, we have found only one example of a symmetric H-bond, in nitromalonamide enol, and all of the others are equilibrating mixtures of tautomers. The nearly universal lack of symmetry is attributed to the presence of these H-bonded species as a mixture of solvatomers, meaning isomers (or stereoisomers or tautomers) that differ in their solvation environment. The disorder of solvation renders the two donor atoms instantaneously inequivalent, whereupon the hydrogen attaches to the less well solvated donor. We therefore conclude that there is no special significance to short, strong, symmetric, low-barrier H-bonds. Moreover, they have no heightened stability or else they would have been more prevalent.",en

The antioxidant capacity of polyphenols in tea can also be modulated by interactions with other substances. In this study, the intermolecular hydrogen bonds between epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and theanine, as well as the antioxidant capacity, were both analyzed and demonstrated. The results showed that the antiradical activity against DPPH• increased by approximate 2.4 %, and the relative cellular activity of PC12 cells in hydrogen peroxide increased by approximate 3.4 %, when appropriate theanine was added to EGCG. This phenomenon could be interpreted by the intermolecular hydrogen bonds between EGCG and theanine, which activated the phenol hydroxyl group of EGCG, inducing the departure of proton and electron. Therefore, the antioxidant capacity was enhanced. The proposed mechanism was verified by electrochemical methods and density functional theoretical calculations. Electrochemical methods confirmed the interactions between EGCG and theanine, and exhibited the shift of the redox peaks before and after the formation of hydrogen bonds.

The study investigated the impact of three lipophilic surfactant emulsifiers [glyceryl monostearate (GMS), polyglycerol ester (PGE), and sucrose ester 970 (S970)] and quinoa hydrolysate (QH) on fat crystallization, physical properties, and morphology of frozen whipped emulsions containing fermented mung bean protein. QH serves as a sustainable and health-conscious alternative to traditional emulsifiers. pH12-shifting treatment was utilized to modulate fermentation performance of mung bean protein. Yogurt-like ice creams (10% coconut oil) were formulated using pre-whipped emulsions comprising fermented pH12-treated mung bean protein (FMP12) or native mung bean protein (NFMP), along with 0.5% (w/w) emulsifiers or QH. Pre-whipped FMP12 emulsions exhibited significantly higher emulsification stability (P < 0.05) compared to NFMP emulsions, owing to the better-balanced hydrophilic-lipophilic nature of FMP12. The individual addition of surfactants and QH promoted fat crystallization and improved the stability and viscous of FMP12 emulsion by competitively adsorbing with FMP12 at the O/W interface. Upon freezing, all three surfactants in whipped creams resulted in uniform and fine ice crystals with a moderate accumulation of oil droplets, showing a comparable effect to QH. Consequently, FMP12 frozen whipped emulsions with surfactants or QH both exhibited superior hardness and overrun, attributed to the presence of fine ice crystals and a stable fat crystal skeleton structure. These findings indicate the prospective utility of QH as a substitute for conventional small chemical emulsifiers, thereby enhancing the quality attributes of plant-based yogurt ice cream.",en

With thermal process, the functional and physical properties of native soy protein can result the texture of food products becoming excessive. This has a negative impact on the sensory characteristics of food products with high concentrations of soy protein. The functional and physical properties of soy protein can be modified using the preheating method by controlling the protein aggregation behavior through the temperature setting used. Thus, this study aims to observe the effect of differences in preheating temperature on the functional and physical properties of soy protein concentrate. Soy protein was observed in the form of soy protein concentrate. Preheating was carried out at 70, 80 and 90°C with a protein concentration of 6% (w/v). The functional and physical properties observed were solubility, gel-forming capacity, voluminosity, microstructure, and protein digestibility.

The protective efficiency was monitored electrochemically and theoretically using different soft wares including Gaussian09, Biovia material studio, and also with Fukui function analysis procedure from D Mol 3 calculations. The preliminary phytochemical screening of active components of the extracts were done using IR and UV-Visible spectral studies. Mangostine and hydroxy citric acid (HCA) were identified as the active constituents of the extracts and their presence on the metal surface after inhibition is confirmed using XPS elemental analysis. The increased activity of the aqueous extract may be due to the increased percentage of HCA in the water extract than the alcoholic counterpart. 4V/V% GCLW has 84 % efficiency at room temperature whereas the same volume percentage alcoholic extract has only 81% efficiency. The inhibition efficiency decreases with rise in temperature suggesting the physical mode of adsorption of the inhibitor system on the metal surface. But the results of computational modelling suggest chemisorption resulted from the donation of electron pairs from O22, H46, and H38 of mangostine and O12 of HCA. This bond is strengthened by the back acceptance of electron pairs from the filled metal orbital to C2 of mangostine and O3 of HCA. Tafel extrapolation studies suggest mixed type inhibition nature for both GCLW and GCLA with anodic prominence. Thermodynamic adsorption suggests the Langmuir monolayer model for GCLW and Temkin model for GCLA.",en

Such complex substrates differently affect PhACs’ soil sorption. To elucidate the effects, batch experiments were conducted using five selected chemicals as model constituents. Urea, KH2PO4, acetic acid, phenol and nonadecanoic acid (C:19) altered the sorption strength and/or nonlinearity of sulfadiazine, caffeine and atenolol in a topsoil. The nonlinear Freundlich model best described sorption. Overall, the PhACs’ sorption coefficients increased in the sequence urea&amp;amp;lt;phosphate&amp;amp;lt;phenol&amp;amp;lt;C:19&amp;amp;lt;acetic acid. The sorption nonlinearity also increased in most cases. The effects on sulfadiazine and caffeine were rather similar, but in many cases different from atenolol. Phosphate mobilized sulfadiazine and caffeine and urea mobilized sulfadiazine, which was explained by sorption competition resulting from specific preference of similar sorption sites. Soil sorbed phenol strongly increased the sorption of all three PhACs; phenolic functional groups are preferred sorption sites of PhACs in soil. The large increase in sorption of all PhACs by acetic acid was attributed to a loosening of the soil organic matter and thus the creation of additional sorption sites. The effect of C:19 fatty acid, however, was inconsistent. These results help to better understand the sorption of PhACs in mixtures of soil and manure.",en

The amino-Claisen rearrangement (ACR) of N-MBA is catalyzed by Lewis acids, cationites, and arylamine hydrochlorides. This work presents the results of studies of ACR N-MBA in solutions of mineral acids. It was found that the reaction must be carried out in dilute solutions. At H 2 SO 4 concentrations of 0.5 mol/L and below, three parallel reactions are observed with the formation of aniline, 2-(1-methyl-2-butenyl) aniline (2-MBA) and 4-(1-methyl-2-butenyl) aniline (4-MBA). The main product in all cases is 2-MBA, the content of which in the reaction mixture exceeds the amount of 4-MBA and aniline by 7 times, which are formed in approximately equal amounts. Prolonged refluxing of 2-MBA under the reaction conditions does not lead to its isomerization to 4-MBA, i.e., the para -isomer is formed directly from N-MBA. The formation of 2,6-di-(1-methyl-2-butenyl) aniline (DMBA) was not observed. In the presence of palladium catalysts, 2-MBA cyclizes to 2,4-methyl quinoline, which indicates the ortho-arrangement of its substituents; 4-MBA does not cyclize under these conditions.

However, the relationship between chemical structure and processability reflects a delicate balance between intermolecular interactions (H-bonding and π–π interactions), steric constraints, and chain conformations. Herein, we employ Cu(I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) click polymerization of a series of aromatic dialkyne monomers with diazide-functionalized aromatic diamides. This approach afforded high-molecular-weight, solution or melt-processable, semi-aromatic polyamides. The aforementioned balance is tuned using the following sequence of backbone functionalities between aromatic groups in the dialkyne: none (biphenyl), methylene (−CH2−), carbonyl (−C(O)−), isopropyl (−C(CH3)2−), and sulfonyl (−SO2−). Temperature-dependent X-ray scattering and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) measurements were used to elucidate the connection between H-bonding and phase behavior in these semi-aromatic polymers. It was found that varying the linking groups between the aromatic rings led to a progression from semicrystalline (biphenyl) to mesomorphic (−CH2–, −C(O)–, −C(CH3)2−) and finally to amorphous (−SO2−) morphologies. For first-generation polymers, denoted by the letter “a” (P1a–P5a), dialkynes bearing a −C(CH3)2– spacer segment led to a polymer with accessible melting transition (Tm < 300 °C), while a −CH2– spacer segment led to a more ordered morphology and an inaccessible melting transition (Tm > 300 °C). Introducing two geminal dimethyl groups into the diazide monomer disrupted the chain packing, leading to amorphous polymers in all but the biphenyl derivative, and improved the thermal stability while the mechanical properties are commensurate with those of engineering thermoplastics. Consequently, the resulting second generation polymers, denoted by the letter “b” (P1b–P5b), were melt processable. We anticipate that this work signifies an advancement to predict the connection between molecular design to the desired thermal properties and morphology of semi-aromatic polyamides.",en

Fatty acids, essential oils, and flavonoids were extracted from PO seeds and leaves using ultrasonic, microwave, and supercritical fluid extraction with RSM techniques. However, investigations on the secondary metabolites and antioxidant capabilities of the aerial part of PO (APO) are scarce. In order to extract polyphenols and antioxidants from APO as effectively as possible, this study used heat reflux extraction (HRE), response surface methodology (RSM), and artificial neural network (ANN) modeling. It also used high-resolution mass spectrometry to identify the APO secondary metabolite. A central-composite design (CCD) was used to establish the ideal ethanol content, extraction time, and extraction temperature to extract the highest polyphenolic compounds and antioxidant activity from APO. According to RSM, the highest amount of TPC (8.23 ± 1.06 mgGAE/g), TFC (43.12 ± 1.15 mgCAE/g), DPPH-scavenging activity (43.01 ± 1.25 % of inhibition) and FRAP (35.98 ± 0.19 µM ascorbic acid equivalent) were obtained at 60.0 % ethanol, 90.2 % time, and 50 °C.

The BiOI@NH2-MIL-125 (Ti)@Zeolite heterostructures combined with UV-assisted peroxone process were investigated for oxidative degradation of the aldehydes in a continuous waste air stream. Different characterisation methods including XRD, FTIR, FESEM, EDS, EDS elemental mapping, BET, TEM and XPS were used to characterise the photocatalyst. This study focuses on optimising the parameters selected for removal of FA and AA using the one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) technique. Therefore, the effects of operational parameters: air flow rate, ozone feeding rate, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration, relative humidity (RH), and initial concentrations on FA and AA removal efficiency were investigated and optimised using the OFAT procedure. The results showed the complete degradation of FA and AA were achieved at optimal conditions (air flow rate: 0.2 L/min, O3 dosage: 0.3 and 0.4 mg/min for FA and AA, respectively, H2O2 concentration: 150 and 200 ppm for FA and AA, respectively, RH of 35%, and an initial pollutant concentration of 5 ppm).

The results suggest that the Ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and 2-(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)phenol (2-Bip) ligands behave in the mono-negatively bi-dentate manner through the (Carboxylic Oxygen & pyridine-ring Oxygen) and (hydroxyl Oxygen & benzimidazole-ring Nitrogen), respectively. Both CPFX1 and CPFX2 complexes were predicted to have tetrahedral structures, while the CPFX3 complex was predicted to have an octahedral structure. Quantum chemistry simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) were used to optimize the suggested structures and investigate the nature of the frontier orbitals through frontier molecular orbital (FMO) analysis. These calculations were used to assign sites on the molecules' surfaces using a molecular electrostatic potential map and understand the structure and reactivity behavior using calculated global reactivity descriptors. The antibacterial activity of the prepared complexes was screened in vitro using two Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus (+ve) and Staphylococcus aureus (+ve)) and two Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli (-ve)) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (-ve)). For in vitro antifungal testing, Candida albicans and Aspergillus flavus were used. Using the 2,2-Di Phenyl Picryl Hydrazyl (DPPH) assay, we checked the ligands and complexes for their potential antioxidant characteristics. It has been shown that the CPFX1, CPFX2 and CPFX3 complexes are biologically more efficient than the antibiotic CPFX-free ligand. Molecular docking was utilized to determine the most probable main binding paths of the coordination compounds to the microbial enzymes, concluding the biological investigation. Molecular docking simulations were performed on the target proteins Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, in addition to Aspergillus flavus, and the Crystal Structure of Human Peroxiredoxin 2 Oxidized.

Hexane-defatted Arbequina olive pomace from California, United States, was extracted with water and loaded to a preparative C18 chromatography. Phenolic desorption was applied by acidified methanolic-water gradients. Phenolic compound profiles and antioxidant/antimicrobial activities were determined. Results showed that the total phenolic contents of the fractions increased with the increase of the percentage of methanol in water gradients; however, the polar phenolic compound profiles generally decreased, while less-polar phenolic compound profiles increased. Oleuropein-aglycone-di-aldehyde (3,4-DHPEA-EDA) detected in water extract was not found in the acidified 35 mL/100 mL and acidified 70 mL/100 mL methanol fractions, but there was a new peak tentatively assigned as 3,4-DHPEA-EDA dimer. The in vitro antioxidant activities of water fractions were higher than that of higher methanolic fractions when they were compared at the same level of gallic acid equivalents; the same trend was observed for the antimicrobial activities evaluated using non-Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Listeria innocua.

Here, we applied the consensus approach to a b-type heme-binding protein to inspect the contribution of a dissociable cofactor to enhanced stability and the chemical consequences of creating a generic heme environment. We targeted the group 1 truncated hemoglobin (TrHb1) subfamily of proteins for their small size (∼120 residues) and ease of characterization. The primary structure, derived from a curated set of ∼300 representative sequences, yielded a highly soluble consensus globin (cGlbN) enriched in acidic residues. Optical and NMR spectroscopies revealed high-affinity heme binding in the expected site and in two orientations. At neutral pH, proximal and distal iron coordination was achieved with a pair of histidine residues, as observed in some natural TrHb1s, and with labile ligation on the distal side. As opposed to studied TrHb1s, which undergo additional folding upon heme binding, cGlbN displayed the same extent of secondary structure whether the heme was associated with the protein or not. Denaturation required guanidine hydrochloride and showed that apo- and holoprotein unfolded in two transitions-the first (occurring with a midpoint of ∼2 M) was shifted to higher denaturant concentration in the holoprotein (∼3.7 M) and reflected stabilization due to heme binding, while the second transition (∼6.2 M) was common to both forms. Thus, the consensus sequence stabilized the protein but exposed the existence of two separately cooperative subdomains within the globin architecture, masked as one single domain in TrHb1s with typical stabilities. The results suggested ways in which specific chemical or thermodynamic features may be controlled in artificial heme proteins.",en

The cyclic voltammetry and amperometric techniques were used to analyze the oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide. Different parameters were optimized including scan rate, pH, and concentration. The material showed promising performance in phosphate buffer of pH 7.2 for standard and serum with correlation coefficients of 0.9897 and 0.99054, respectively. The detection limit for hydrogen peroxide was 5.9 µM and 7.3 µM (n = 3) for standard and serum, respectively. Fe-Ni@GCE is selective towards hydrogen peroxide in the presence of interferences. The modified electrode is stable up to 50 hrs with a loss of 25% performance. The developed sensor is applied to evaluate the percentage recovery from human blood serum samples of smokers and non-smokers. A quantitative study is also performed using serum samples of smokers and nonsmokers. The results showed a positive association and higher H2O2 in smokers compared to nonsmokers.

X-ray powder diffraction analysis, Fourier Ttransform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method revealed changes in the structure and porosity of zeolites upon calcination. Voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used for testing four zeolites for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media. OER starts the earliest at Ce-β cal with onset overpotential 50, 70, and 110 mV lower than Ce-ZSM-5 cal, Ce-ZSM-5, and Ce-β. Ce-β cal further showed the lowest OER Tafel slope (114 mV dec−1). Consequently, the highest OER current density was recorded in the case of Ce-β cal, followed by Ce-β, Ce-ZSM-5 cal, and Ce-ZSM-5. Regarding ORR, Ce-ZSM-5 cal showed the lowest Tafel slope (70 mV dec−1) with the highest current densities that remained constant during the chronoamperometry test with a negligible decrease of 4%.

The DKR proceeds via a Rh-catalyzed intermolecular asymmetric reductive aldol reaction with acrylate esters, with simultaneous generation of three stereogenic elements. The strategy relies on the labilization of the stereogenic axis that takes place thanks to a transient Lewis acid-base interaction (LABI) between the formyl group and a thioether moiety strategically located at the ortho' position.

Due to its important role in human health, we were interested in synthesizing hyocholic acid to explore potential biochemical properties of this bile acid. Here, a synthesis of hyocholic acid is reported from chenodeoxycholic acid. The key step was a Rubottom oxidation of a silyl enol ether intermediate to directly incorporate the oxygen at C6. Furthermore, the synthesized hyocholic acid product was treated with NaIO4 to cleave the C6-C7 bond to yield a hemiacetal at C6. This CC bond cleavage reaction using NaIO4 was used to develop an ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method to distinguish between a 1 to 1 mixture of hyocholic acid and cholic acid (a 12α-hydroxylated bile acid), two bile acid regioisomers with identical masses. Upon treatment of the mixture with NaIO4, hyocholic acid was selectively cleaved in the B ring (C6-C7 bond) to yield the hemiacetal that formed between the C3-hydroxy and the C6-aldehyde moiety with an m/z 405 while cholic acid remained intact with an m/z 407 in the negative electrospray ionization mode. Subsequently, a commercially available ox bile extract was treated with NaIO4 to detect bile acid derivatives by mass spectrometry. Two possible hyocholic acid derivatives conjugated to serine and gamma-glutamic semialdehyde were detected in electrospray ionization positive mode, which oxidatively cleaved with NaIO4 (m/z 496 and 522 to m/z 494 and 520, respectively).",en
https://openalex.org/W4380575655,2023,Chemistry,"Structural basis of regioselective tryptophan dibromination by the single-component flavin-dependent halogenase AetFThe flavin-dependent halogenase (FDH) AetF successively brominates tryptophan at C5 and C7 to generate 5,7-dibromotryptophan. In contrast to the well studied two-component tryptophan halogenases, AetF is a single-component flavoprotein monooxygenase. Here, crystal structures of AetF alone and in complex with various substrates are presented, representing the first experimental structures of a single-component FDH. Rotational pseudosymmetry and pseudomerohedral twinning complicated the phasing of one structure. AetF is structurally related to flavin-dependent monooxygenases. It contains two dinucleotide-binding domains for binding the ADP moiety with unusual sequences that deviate from the consensus sequences GXGXXG and GXGXXA. A large domain tightly binds the cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), while the small domain responsible for binding the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADP) is unoccupied. About half of the protein forms additional structural elements containing the tryptophan binding site. FAD and tryptophan are about 16 Å apart. A tunnel between them presumably allows diffusion of the active halogenating agent hypohalous acid from FAD to the substrate. Tryptophan and 5-bromotryptophan bind to the same site but with a different binding pose. A flip of the indole moiety identically positions C5 of tryptophan and C7 of 5-bromotryptophan next to the tunnel and to catalytic residues, providing a simple explanation for the regioselectivity of the two successive halogenations. AetF can also bind 7-bromotryptophan in the same orientation as tryptophan. This opens the way for the biocatalytic production of differentially dihalogenated tryptophan derivatives. The structural conservation of a catalytic lysine suggests a way to identify novel single-component FDHs.",en

The maximum sorption amounts of arsenic species on V-PE (3.33-20.10 mg/kg) and W-PE MPs (4.78-21.93 mg/kg) had no significant difference, while those on B-PE (43.02-252.19 mg/kg) facilitated by its additives were up to one order of magnitude greater than V-PE or W-PE (p < 0.05). Desorption hysteresis index (HI) indicated the irreversible arsenic sorption on three PE MPs, especially for B-PE containing additives that can co-precipitate and complex with arsenicals. The effects of pH, humic substances, and coexisting anions on arsenic sorption by B-PE were more obvious than that by V-PE or W-PE MPs, attributing to electrostatic interaction enhanced by CaCO3 and TiO2 additives.

SULTs contribute to the conjugation phase of metabolism and share substrates with the uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) family of enzymes. UGTs are considered to be the most important enzymes in the conjugation phase, and SULTs are an auxiliary enzyme system to them. Understanding how the regioselectivity of SULTs differs from that of UGTs is essential from the perspective of developing novel drug candidates. We present a general ligand-based SULT model trained and tested using high-quality experimental regioselectivity data. The current study suggests that, unlike other metabolic enzymes in the modification and conjugation phases, the SULT regioselectivity is not strongly influenced by the activation energy of the rate-limiting step of the catalysis. Instead, the prominent role is played by the substrate binding site of SULT. Thus, the model is trained only on steric and orientation descriptors, which mimic the binding pocket of SULT.

Several visual representations of the response of the ionization events based on the polymer molecular weight and the repeating unit were used to elucidate trends in ionization. Evaluation of the influence of the oligomer length and end-group on the electrospray ionization of the polymer allowed the development of a process to enable selective ionization for these complex polymers.",en

Solution conformation was probed in detail using NMR and CD spectroscopy. Irrespective of the solvent polarity, peptide containing γ 2,2 amino acid residues failed to form the isolated tight β‐turn mimetic while peptides containing γ 3,3 and γ 4,4 residues successfully adopted isolated non‐helical C 12 β‐turn mimic structure. The conformations adopted in solution were corroborated with DFT calculations. Such difference in the stereochemical ability of these di‐substituted γ amino acid residues arose from the difference in position of the di‐substitution along the backbone of the residue. Thus prudent choice of the position of di‐substitution in ω amino acid residues might be used as a strong peptidomimetic handle to control the structural design and generate complex structures.",en

However, the relatively inferior functionality compared to soy protein is hindering the expanded use of pulse proteins, namely pea and chickpea protein, in various applications. Harsh extraction and processing conditions adversely impact the functional performance of pea and chickpea protein. Therefore, a mild protein extraction method involving salt extraction coupled with ultrafiltration (SE-UF) was evaluated for the production of chickpea protein isolate (ChPI). The produced ChPI was compared to pea protein isolate (PPI) produced following the same extraction method in terms of functionality and feasibility of scaling. Scaled-up (SU) ChPI and PPI were produced under industrially relevant settings and evaluated in comparison to commercial pea, soy, and chickpea protein ingredients. Controlled scaled-up production of the isolates resulted in mild changes in protein structural characteristics and comparable or improved functional properties. Partial denaturation, modest polymerization, and increased surface hydrophobicity were observed in SU ChPI and PPI compared to the benchtop counterparts. The unique structural characteristics of SU ChPI, including its ratio of surface hydrophobicity and charge, contributed to superior solubility at both a neutral and acidic pH compared to both commercial soy protein and pea protein isolates (cSPI and cPPI) and significantly outperformed cPPI in terms of gel strength. These findings demonstrated both the promising scalability of SE-UF and the potential of ChPI as a functional plant protein ingredient.",en

Biomol. Chem. 2015, 13, 6984). The model compounds investigated include a porphyrin with an acidic side chain, and a three-island archipelago compound with pyridine as the central island and pyrene for the outer islands. The possible stoichiometries and conformations for complexes were explored and compared to the experimental results. Our computational results show that there are four possible complexes involving these two model compounds with large (K&gt;1000) equilibrium constants of formation, which will exist in competition with each other. We find that both hydrogen bonding and π − π stacking are important to this aggregation. On the other hand, neither water-mediated aggregation nor coordination to open porphyrin sites was found to be significant in this system, in contrast to some previous suggestions of their importance. The multiple possible stoichiometries of complexes confound some of the analysis done in the experimental paper, as Job plots assume that only one complex is present. Gibbs free energies of association were determined for various complexes, with and without microhydration, at the ωB97X-V/def2-QZVPP//ωB97X-D4/def2-SVP level of theory, and using the Solvation Model based on Density (SMD) configured for benzene solvent.

Here we report sterically controlled rhodium-catalyzed SN2'-type substitution reactions of optically active tertiary propargylic alcohols with arylmetallic species affording the non-readily available enantioenriched tetrasubstituted allenes via either exclusive syn- or anti-β-OH elimination, respectively, under two sets of different reaction parameters. Detailed mechanistic experiments and density functional theory (DFT) studies reveal that the exclusive anti-Rh(I)-OH elimination is dictated by the simultaneous aid of in situ generated boric acid and ambient water, which act as the shuttle in the hydroxy relay to facilitate the Rh(I)-OH elimination process via a unique ten-membered cyclic transition state (anti-TS2_u). By contrast, the syn-Rh(III)-OH elimination in C-H bond activation-based allenylation reaction is controlled by a four-membered cyclic transition state (syn-TS3) due to the steric surroundings around the Rh(III) center preventing the approach of the other assisting molecules. Under the guidance of these mechanistic understandings, a stereodivergent protocol to construct the enantiomer of optically active tetrasubstituted allenes from the same starting materials is successfully developed.",en

BBS extract was chosen due to its suitable physicochemical properties (acidity index, peroxide index, refraction index, and relative density) and predominance of saturated fatty acids, identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), which promote biological activities and high oxidative stability. NEs were characterized by mean droplet size, morphology, polydispersity index (PdI), pH, and organoleptic properties, and the physical stability of the NEs was evaluated for 120 days at room temperature. The sun protection factor (SPF) was determined, and the photostability and in vitro cytotoxicity assays were performed for NEs. All NEs remained stable for 120 days, with a droplet size <150 nm and a monomodal distribution profile. The pH values were compatible with the skin’s pH. NE3 showed a spherical morphology, with a mean droplet size of 125.15 ± 0.16 nm and PdI of 0.145 ± 0.032.

In this work, a sulfonate-functionalized magnetic COF (Fe3O4@COF-SO3Na) was synthesized by self-polycondensation of two-in-one monomer 1,6-bis(4-formylphenyl)-3,8-bis((4-aminophenyl) ethynyl)) pyrene (BFBAEPy) on the surface of aminated Fe3O4 and a thiol-yne click reaction. It was further adopted as an adsorbent for the efficient magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE) of basic orange II. The selective adsorption experiment indicated that it displayed selective adsorption ability to basic orange II due to the ion exchange, hydrogen bonds, and π-π interactions. Under the optimized conditions, the proposed MSPE method coupled with HPLC-DAD showed excellent linearity in the range of 0.05-0.5 µg/mL (R2 = 0.9997) for basic orange II. The lower limits of detection (LODs) for basic orange II were 1.0-1.4 µg/L for three food samples: yellow croaker, paprika and dried bean curd. The recoveries were 90.1-98.8% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) below 4.2%. Therefore, this work provides an effective strategy to modify magnetic COFs as absorbents in MSPE.

DFT computations were carried out to study the whole catalytic cycle of Pd/Xiao‐Phos‐catalyzed asymmetric arylation of SPOs, and a modified mechanism including tautomerization and arylation was presented. Some new tautomerization mechanisms have been traversed, including base‐assisted and Pd/Xiao‐Phos‐catalyzed tautomerization. These are different from the existing report, where base‐assisted tautomerization is the most favored. The resulting intermediate enters the downstream arylation directly. Furthermore, oxidative addition is identified as the enantioselectivity‐determining step. IGMH analysis results indicate that the different non‐bonding interactions between Xiao‐Phos and SPO parts determine the enantioselectivity.

In this study, metabolomics combined with sensory analysis was performed to identify relationships between chemical profile and sensory quality of honey. Targeted metabolomic analysis was conducted to determine volatile and non-volatile profiles of seven different honey. Volatile profile was analyzed using headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled to GC−MS. LC−MS/MS, HPLC−UV, and HPLC-RI were employed to analyze flavonoids, organic acids, and sugars, respectively. Authentic standards were utilized for confirmation of metabolites. Sensory evaluation included quantitative descriptive analysis and consumer acceptance test. The results showed that sucrose (sweetness) was responsible for a positive hedonic perception, while organic acids and flavonoids (sourness, astringency, bitterness) negatively affected consumer acceptance. Volatiles with floral notes (e.g. decyl formate) were preferred, but others with off-flavors (e.g. 2-methylbenzofuran) were not preferred by consumers. Flavor familiarity was strongly correlated with the consumer acceptance of honey, indicating that the balance between volatiles and non-volatiles is significant for honey flavor quality. This work demonstrates the role of key flavor compounds in honey quality, and may be applicable to the quality control of honey.",en

The pre-synthesized support under ultrasound irradiation was incubated with N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide to mediate the covalent attachment between the carboxylic groups on the support surface and amino groups of enzyme molecules. The in situ immobilization in which the enzyme molecules directly were embedded into the metal–organic framework was performed under mild operating conditions in a facile one-step manner. Both immobilized derivatives of the enzyme were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, FT-IR spectra, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. In the in situ immobilization method, the enzyme molecules were efficiently encapsulated within the support with a high loading capacity (220 ± 5 mg/g support). On the other hand, the covalent attachment resulted in immobilizing much lower concentrations of the enzyme (20 ± 2.2 mg/g support). Although both immobilized derivatives of lipase showed broader pH and temperature tolerance relative to the soluble enzyme, the biocatalyst, which was prepared through in situ method, was more stable at elevated temperatures than the covalently immobilized lipase. Furthermore, in situ immobilized derivatives of Candida antarctica lipase A could be efficiently reused for at least eight cycles (> 70% of retained activity).

Herein, the interaction of gallic acid ( GA ), methylgallic acid ( MGA ), ethylgallic acid ( EGA ) with cytosine (the most reactive part of DNA) has been studied in detail using first principle density functional theory (DFT). Several interaction configurations between the gallic acid and selected derivatives have been investigated using DFT at the M06‐2X/6‐31+G(d,p) theoretical method, topological analysis based on quantum theory of atoms‐in‐molecule (QTAIM), and the noncovalent interaction (NCI) which aid in the understanding of interactions between studied compounds. The results obtained from the interaction energy and energy decomposition analysis (EDA) show that methylgallate ( GA ) has the largest interaction energy with cytosine, along with the strongest H‐bond interaction and is best suited for drug design due to its lowest value of stabilization energy at the interaction site 1.Similarly, weak interactions were observed between EGA and cytosine of DNA between −0.02 to 0.01 a.u with a sparing trace of H bond with the aid of non‐covalent interaction (NCI).

A combined classical molecular dynamics and quantum chemical studyThe hydration structure and related dynamics of caffeine diluted in ambient liquid water have been extensively studied by performing classical molecular dynamics simulations, using our previously developed potential model of caffeine and the TIP4P/2005 water model. The results obtained have revealed that the first hydration shell of caffeine contains on average 56 water molecules. Hydrated caffeine forms in total 3 hydrogen bonds with its neighbor water molecules, with the Ocaffeine … Hwater hydrogen bonds exhibiting similar lifetimes with the ones corresponding to Owater … Hwater hydrogen bonds in liquid water. The self-diffusion coefficient of caffeine has been found to be four times lower than the corresponding value for water, being also in agreement with recent experimental measurements. The presence of water molecules inside the solvation shell of caffeine changes significantly their low-frequency intermolecular vibrations, as reflected on the calculated atomic velocity time correlation functions and corresponding spectral densities. Using the estimated average intermolecular structure of the first hydration shell of caffeine, the molecular cluster caffeine@W56 was optimized via quantum chemical calculations and the subsequent time-dependent density functional theory were performed in order to predict the ultraviolet-visible and fluorescence spectra of hydrated caffeine. The results obtained are in agreement with recent experimental studies, which have proposed that such spectroscopic measurements can be used for the direct determination of alkaloids in aqueous extracts of natural products. In this framework, multi-scale molecular modelling providing accurate predictions of experimental data could also be a very useful tool, linking theoretical physical chemistry with analytical chemistry applications.",en

The aggregates, in sequence, carry out the whole complex of works aimed at road construction. The use of satellite navigation opens up broad prospects for full automation of the aggregates, so the overall goal is to create a complex of aggregates that carry out the continuous construction of roads, mainly in automatic mode. One of the devices which are part of the units of continuous operation is a bucket wheel type agitator. The use of direct-flow rotary rippers for soil development is restrained by insufficient theoretical justification of their parameters. Before analyzing the interaction of the elements of bucket wheel type agitator with the ground, it is necessary to clarify the design layout of the bucket wheel type rotor. Some design parameters of the bucket-wheel type agitator are derived from logical reasoning. Other parameters of a bucket wheel type agitator are obtained by plotting the impact of the blade on the ground in the plane and spatial simulation. The conclusion about the necessity to install a small rotor in addition to the large rotor coaxially with it has been drawn from here. The feed to the end-knife, i.e., the thickness of the layer cut by the end-knife, has been determined. Based on the adopted methodology, the geometric and operating parameters of a large bucket wheel type agitator rotor have been determined.

In order to improve the performance of the fuel cell air compressor (FCAC), the multi-parameter optimization was conducted at part load based on the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis. Firstly, the bench test for a centrifugal air compressor was conducted and the comprehensive performance was obtained. Then, the CFD model for the FCAC was built and calibrated by tested data. On this basis, the numerical analysis and structural optimization of the FCAC were performed, and the influence mechanisms of structure parameters on the flow and thermodynamic processes of air compressor were clarified. The results illustrate that, the blade tail, volute tongue and the longitudinal section of the volute for the original FCAC require further optimization. The performance of the FCAC is improved by the synergistic optimization of four structural parameters, which are the outlet mounting angle of the blade tail, volute tongue angle, volute inlet radius and diffuser inlet diameter. Compared with the original FCAC, the pressure ratio and isentropic efficiency of the optimized FCAC are increased by 1.72% and 5.70%, respectively.

Such a device would be folded on the ground to meet airport width restrictions, locked during cruise for optimal aerodynamic performance, and released during maneuvers to alleviate flight loads. In contrast, this paper uses a wind tunnel experiment to study the aeroelastic behavior of floating wingtip fuel tanks. This device consists of a freely floating wingtip with an additional mass attached in the form of a liquid-filled fuel tank. The static aeroelastic results show that altering the fuel tank’s filling level and position allows the wingtip to float at an optimal angle for aerodynamic efficiency across various angles of attack and fuel masses. Additionally, this paper shows that, with careful selection of the mass distribution of the wingtip, dynamic load alleviation comparable to the semi-aeroelastic hinge concept can be achieved during turbulence and one-minus-cosine encounters. Furthermore, the effect of fluid motion is shown to reduce incremental loads during random turbulence encounters by up to 10%; however, it has a negligible impact on the response to one-minus-cosine encounters. Such results are also confirmed by a numerical model incorporating a simple reduced-order fluid sloshing model.",en

Due to manufacturing error and asymmetric load, the ovality occurs on pipeline and increases the difficulty to install the connector. For ensure safety, it is necessary to consider the interference and ovality of pipeline to predict the installation load. In this paper, the software ANSYS was used to establish the finite element model of the connector and pipeline, then the contact characteristics on the contact surface were analyzed. According to the static equilibrium equation, the installation load of interference fit is equivalent to the friction force and is proportional to the contact pressure, it could be predicted according to the contact pressure. The results indicate that, on the premise of the same equivalent interference, the contact force and contact area on the contact surface were independent of the ovality of pipeline.

Under the rapid development of subway systems, a fundamental understanding of subway fire safety is critically needed to benefit its designs and assessment. Previous studies on train carriage fires are limited to single-carriage fires under natural ventilation. However, it is still unclear how longitudinal ventilation affects the smoke movement in the train carriage with lateral openings. Therefore, a series of 1:3 reduced-scale experimental tests were conducted to investigate the smoke temperature characteristics in a train carriage located in a longitudinally ventilated tunnel. Under various fire sizes and ventilation rates, the ceiling gas temperature and smoke layer height were measured. Compared to the traditional fire scenario with end openings, the maximum ceiling gas temperature and the downstream temperature distribution decay factor are relatively smaller because of the lateral flame tilt and less heat loss during smoke propagation. The effects of ventilation velocity on the maximum ceiling gas temperature are significantly weakened under the blockage effect of the train carriage. The downstream temperature distribution followed a single exponential attenuation function, independent of the fire size and ventilation rate. However, the upstream temperature distribution is much more complex under the restriction of the end wall. A four-segment model was proposed to predict the upstream temperature distribution based on the relationship between the back-layering length and half the carriage length. The fire size and ventilation rate also show limited influence on the smoke stratification, with a layer height of 0.316 m in the stable region. The research outcomes offer adeeper understanding of the smoke propagation of the subway train carriage fire and a theoretical guide on the designs of future tunnels.",en

However, the classic vacuum brake booster is no longer capable of meeting these requirements. A revolutionary Electro-Magnetic brake booster system is suggested in this research; this system is aimed to perform the function of boosting or enhancing the driver's pedal power despite remaining dependent on the vacuum source. Such an Electro-magnetic brake booster is mainly composed of an Electro-magnetic core plate, a ferromagnetic actuating plate and an ECU. It consumes electrical energy and converts into magnetic force to attract the metallic actuating plate, which is mechanically coupled to the pushrod of the master cylinder. However, the power required for braking (developing pressure in a master cylinder) is provided by the electrical power source. The core plate is associated with a pole as the electromagnet cores are mounted on one side of it. By incorporating a pedal pressure sensor linked to the ECU, which can control the electric power input to this core plate. Thus, the magnetic force developed is used in pulling the Actuating plate. In turn, it builds up the required pressure in the master cylinder. This novel Electro-Magnetic brake booster can be a better solution to satisfy the drawbacks of the existing brake boosters such as complexity in the structure and mechanism.

Conventional Diverter system doesn't qualify for a well control device but a device that is expected to reduce safety risk. Unfortunately, Diverter system has numerous failures when engaged for diverting gas flow. This paper provides a successful case history of a feasible and sustainable solution to drill shallow holes with safer control of gas at surface and superior operational liberty. Diverter system coupled with autonomous Ram-BOP was deployed successfully in development well for drilling of a surface hole section with better control and safety. This Modified Diverter system allows independent control for Ram-BOP and Diverter operations with back-up flow path in case of diverter failure. This also creates ability to drill surface hole deeper by providing operational liberty to control or divert well flow. This system was designed to support two well control scenarios, on drilled depth basis, and prepared accordingly: Conventional diverter system, keeping alternate flow diversion path as backup to diverter failure Modified well control method, that approach well control with Kill Mud cap and provides option for close-system flow check Surface hole section was planned to drill till 1300 meters BKB, with the application of this modified diverter system that allowed safe control of well/gas diversion in contrast to the conventional diverter system. For this purpose, Conductor pipe was set to 80m BKB rig less. And surface hole drilling was split in two sections with respect to application modes of modified diverter system. For initial 600 meters conventional diverter system was in-place with complete hole volume Kill Mud available at surface. This system also allowed alternate gas diversion in case of diverter failure during gas flow.

Methods: Stage-by-stage processing of test results is carried out: initially, the average values of pressing force and the actual pressing force on a single brake block is determined. Then the coefficient of friction between the blocks and the wheel and the maximum slope of the track, on which the railway rolling stock is retained by the parking brake, are calculated. The solution of the problem is based on the iteration method, which must be applied twice: at the first stage, in order to find the value of the total pressing force on the brake blocks from the action of the parking brake, taking into account that the maximum slope of the track, on which the train is retained by the parking brake, equals 30‰, then at the second stage, such a value of the moment on the parking brake drive shaft is selected so that the value of the required pressing force on the brake blocks from the action of the parking brake is the same as with the maximum slope of the track id = 30 ‰, after which the obtained results are evaluated and compared with the normative values.

Correct analysis methods should be used and evaluated in order to meet this basic requirement. Identifying the negative effects of working postures, taking corrective measures and improving them is a critical step of an efficient working environment. Working postures that are not properly analyzed cause strain on workers and even discomfort. It provides important contributions in the field of analyzing and improving working postures with scientific methods, controlling work performance and reducing musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). OWAS (Ovako Working Posture Analyzing System) and RULA (Rapid Upper Limb Assessment) are successfully applied in various fields in the analysis of working postures. In this study, it was aimed to determine the MSDs risk levels of the workers working in the rubber industry by OWAS and RULA methods and measures were proposed for these risks. While OWAS analysis was obtained by using expert opinions in the study, CATIAV5R20 program was used for RULA analysis. The study includes the examination of 5 different postures in total. In the OWAS and RULA results of the study, it was seen that the most risky postures are attach the rubber hose to the cores and to place the rubber hoses attached to the cores in the autoclave.

Autonomous Aerial Refueling (AAR) is anticipated to be used to complete aerial refueling for unmanned aircraft. There are three aerial refueling methods: the Probe-and-Drogue Refueling (PDR) refueling method, the flying-boom refueling method, and the boom-drogue-adapter refueling method. The paper considers the PDR approach, the most challenging of the three, because the flexible hose-drogue assembly has fast dynamics and is susceptible to various kinds of winds, which makes the probe docking with the drogue difficult. PDR is divided into four phases, namely the rendezvous phase, joining phase, refueling phase, and reform phase, with the refueling phase being the most crucial. The controller design faces the greatest challenge during the docking control of the refueling phase since it calls for a high level of safety, precision, and efficiency. As a result, the modeling and control issues encountered during the refueling phase are typical and difficult. The fundamental idea of AAR is presented in the paper first, after which the characteristics and requirements of AAR are outlined. The progress in modeling and control techniques for the AAR’s refueling phase is then systematically reviewed.

The growth in the adoption of EVs results in the need for broadly spread charging stations, hence a Photovoltaic (PV) based EV charging system is adopted since the generation of power from PV is possible everywhere. An EV charging system with two converters is constructed in this research work, one of which is a re-lift Luo converter and the other is a Dual Active Bridge (DAB) converter. A re-lift Luo converter is adopted for the conversion of the low PV voltage output to an enhanced voltage of a higher level. The DAB converter is effective in providing the required galvanic isolation and allowing bidirectional power flow. The PV system’s output voltage fluctuates with changing weather conditions and solar irradiation. Hence, the operation of the re-lift Luo converter is controlled by using the Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC), which is highly capable of addressing the uncertainties associated with PV output. The operation of the DAB converter is controlled by implementing the Phase Shift (PS) control technique. MATLAB simulation is done to validate the proposed system's performance.",en

It was established that frequency regulation is one of the quantitative energy-saving methods of controlling the operation of the pumping unit. At the same time, the influence on the pump unit is carried out by changing the operating point by means of variable pump curve. The hydraulic schemes for experimental study of frequency-controlled pumps presented in the article have certain disadvantages: 1) the location of the pump relative to the tank is ambiguous regarding the operation of the pump under flooded suсtion; 2) pressure regulation is provided only in the direction of its decrease; 3) refers rather to the automation of pumping installations. On the designed and manufactured experimental stand, it is possible to study the operation of the pump with the use of a frequency converter and without it, through a bypass line. When testing the pump for systems that operate according to the fluid level in the suction tank, use either a valve on the discharge pipeline (with the use of a frequency converter) or a ball valve on the discharge pipeline from the discharge tank (without the use of a frequency converter). In addition, pump testing using a frequency converter can be performed for pressure-operated systems. The installed frequency converter is a regulator of the flow of the working fluid, which allows adjusting of the pump discherge. The pump designed on the experimental stand is a self-suction jet that does not need to be installed under flooded suсtion. The discharge tank is located higher than the suction tank, which ensures the circulation of the working fluid by gravity. The working fluid will be water.

Based on the UWB impedance matching network, the UWB filtering impedance transformers are designed, and the UWB filtering power dividers are achieved by impedance transforming one port of one or more impedance transformers. The transformers consist of a multi-mode stepped-impedance resonator (SIR) and defected ground structures (DGSs). The SIR is tightly coupled to two ports of different impedance levels via the unsymmetrical two-sided coupled lines and DGSs. In addition, two transformers that convert impedance from 50 Ω to 100 Ω are connected to form a UWB power divider with filtering function. The 25 Ω port of an impedance transformer with a 50 Ω to 25 Ω conversion is impedance matched to two 50 Ω ports connected in parallel, resulting in another power divider with filtering function. Thus, two prototype UWB impedance transformers from 50 Ω to 100 Ω and from 50 Ω to 25 Ω are designed and their corresponding power dividers are also designed and fabricated. The simulated and measured results are consistent, demonstrating good features, such as return loss greater than 10 dB and insertion loss less than 4.5 dB in the passband, UWB filtering capacity with out-of-band rejection greater than 20 dB, and compact size smaller than 1.2λ × 2.1λ (λ is the wavelength of the central frequency).",en

Over-wing nacelle (OWN) configuration has a high potential to improve upon the conventional under-wing nacelle (UWN) configuration. OWN configurations have two critical benefits when compared to the conventional UWN configuration: 1. they ease the integration of high BPR and ultra-high BPR engines by alleviating ground clearance issues, and 2. they provide a significant amount of noise reduction because the wing blocks the noise of the fan and the jet. Despite their advantages, the OWN technology is not used in practical aircraft designs due to the difficulties in the aeropropulsive integration of the propulsion system. In this work, we propose using a coupled aeropropulsive design optimization framework to study the aeropropulsive integration for OWN configurations. The coupling behavior between the aerodynamics of the wing and the propulsion system is extremely important. Especially in OWN configurations, the propulsion system is highly influenced by the aerodynamic performance of the wing. In this paper, we address the design problem of coupling between the aerodynamic and the propulsion system. We also explore wide range of design space to achieve the best practical design. The changes in wing shape are insignificant when the OWN configuration is optimized for different FPR. Wing in OWN performs better when the propulsor is close to the wing's root; however, the overall drag increases when the propulsor is close to the root. This increases the shaft power need. In addition, nacelle placement at the aft of the trailing edge shows better performance than forward of the trailing edge of the wing. These advancements in design optimization capabilities will be critical in the future design of OWN configurations to achieve more environmentally sustainable aircraft designs.",en

The Taguchi method’s orthogonal array L 27 examines the effect of material dynamic response factors on the pier damage level. According to Taguchi’s design of experiments, five input criteria relating to reinforced concrete bridge materials properties have been chosen as controllable factors: concrete strength, rebar strength, damping ratio, isolator pier stiffness, and abutment stiffness. The nonlinear time history approach uses Midas- Civil for a 3-D finite element model of an existing bridge at Sangli, India. The research included bridge pier collapse as a performance criterion. The analysis of variance revealed that stiffness of abutment, stiffness of pier, and damping ratio for pier deck significantly impacted the pier collapse performance. The result shows that concrete strength and damping ratio are the essential parameters, with 42% and 41% of the total contribution to pier displacement, respectively.

Such generation plants are generally inverter based and these devices are known sources of harmonics of the fundamental frequency and ‘supraharmonics’ (distortion in the frequency range 2 to 150 kHz). It has long been theorized that due to factors such as the frequency response of service transformers that interface solar PV plants to the grid, impedance of the power system at the point of common coupling and the impedance of devices connected near solar inverters, supraharmonics frequencies are localized and generally do not couple to the grid. Exceptions to this general hypothesis have been reported in Europe, where supraharmonics from PV and wind power plants have been shown to couple to the local three-phase three wire Medium Voltage (MV) system. This paper shows that in three-phase four wire multi-point grounded MV systems, such as the ones used in the United States (U.S.), application of conventional grounding schemes to PV plants can lead to the unintended consequence of coupling of supraharmonics to the grid through the neutral conductor and ground circuit. It describes a case study in which supraharmonics due to inverter switching led to telephone interference for customers located around a solar PV plant. To determine the mechanism by which the supraharmonics frequencies were coupling to the grid, an investigation of the emission from the plant was performed using conducted as well as radiated measurements. The novel setup used for performing these radiated measurements, the unique underlying mechanism by which inverter switching frequencies coupled to the grid and the lessons learned in this process regarding solar PV grounding and installation practices are described in this paper.",en

Clarifying the dynamic response characteristics of a tunnel element moored inside a harbor is useful for the evaluation and design of the mooring system. In this paper, by carrying out physical model tests, the law of wave development in the harbor was investigated, and the motion response of the tunnel element and cable force of the mooring system were also measured. Dynamic response characteristics under different environmental factors, the influence of tunnel element load conditions, and the mutual interference of multiple elements moored simultaneously were analyzed. The results show that dynamic response characteristics under wind are significantly different from those under waves. Under no-load or half-load conditions, which correspond to greater freeboard-to-draft ratios, the dynamic responses of the tunnel element are more unfavorable than those under heavy-load or full-load conditions.

Lastly, from the ARP's correlation with these parameters, establishes a safe operation area as motor drive system design guideline. Contrary to the general belief that systems using short cable or integrated systems have less insulation damage, this study shows that the OV stress in these systems can be critical. This paper offers a simplified methodology to optimize the reliability of the drive system and mitigate the ARP. By using this approach, the paper suggests that the time-consuming iterative design of dV/dt filters or overdesign of insulation can be eliminated. The practical test and modeled system are conducted to validate the approach.",en

The GPS receiver must have the feed circuit handling a circularly polarized electric field entering the radiating element leading up to division into quadrature branches, which has been used in the conventional works. But, it takes one frequency and a new approach is needed to take two frequencies. A lattice comprising segments loaded with series and parallel capacitors and circumferential inductors is built to make the branch-line coupler handle two frequencies. L1 and L2 bands for GPS are chosen and the circuit modelling is conducted to design the component. The method is verified by running a microwave circuit simulator and measurement of the s-parameters of the fabricated prototype. The power division and reflection coefficient at 1.5 GHz as L1- and 1.2 GHz as L2-band show the result is in good agreement with the required performance.",en
https://openalex.org/W4387619967,2023,Engineering,"Dynamic analysis of offshore triceratops supporting wind turbine: Preliminary studiesOffshore triceratops, the recent innovation in deep water compliant platforms, is primarily designed to withstand lateral forces through its geometric shape. The uniqueness of the platform is the presence of the ball joints between the legs and deck, which partially restrain the transfer of rotations from the legs to the deck and vice-versa. However, displacements such as surge, sway, and heave motions are transferred, ensuring a rigid connection between the legs and the deck. Efficient operations of offshore wind turbines are more dependent on the support systems on which they are mounted. Increased stability and reduction in stress concentration in rigid connections are desirable. Nonlinear dynamic response analysis is carried out in FAST by coupling the frequency response of the platform obtained in ANSYS AQWA with that of the HydroDyn module of FAST. The current study investigates a fully coupled three-dimensional hydro-aerodynamic model of triceratops mounted with a horizontal axis wind turbine. Unsteady Blade Element Momentum theory (BEM) is used to estimate the aerodynamic loads, which encompasses the effect of wind shear using a power law and spatially coherent turbulence. In contrast, Morison equations are used to estimate the hydrodynamic loads on the platform. After the preliminary proportioning of the platform, Response Amplitude Operator (RAO) plots are drawn to illustrate the partial motion transfer between the deck and the buoyant legs. Based on the preliminary studies, it is seen that the environmental loads do not impose instability, reinforcing the dynamic stability of the platform. Frequency responses for operating and parked conditions illustrate the coupling between the degrees of freedom and the influence of the rotor motion of the wind turbine on the platform deck. Tether tension variation is assessed in all three legs for the operational sea states to check the safety standards for a compliant system to avoid tether pull-out. The presented study is prima facie to encourage the suitability of triceratops as floaters to support the wind turbine under moderate sea states. Highlights This study is focused on new-generation offshore triceratops as support system for wind turbine Prelimiary dynamic anlaysis of coupled action of the supprting system and wind turbine are presented Use of ball joints help partial isolation of the deck and restrain transfer of moment from the turbine shaft to the supporting system, which is a novelty Infleunce of rotor motion of the triceratops is illustarted to highlight the advantage of complinacy of trirceratops This study disucsses only the performance assessment and not the design perspectives",en

A compact transformer-less interstage network is proposed for direct power division for carrier and peaking amplifiers. The power division ratio at the interstage is designed to dynamically vary according to the input power level to provide higher power gain and desired load impedance modulation. By utilizing the non-linear input reactance of the peaking amplifier, broadband dynamic power division circuits were designed for an operating frequency band of as broad as 1 GHz. In addition, active bias circuits for the peaking amplifier were optimized to have sufficient gain expansion, so that the overall AM-AM characteristics is as flat as possible. A broadband load modulation network using one transformer and two quarter-wave transmission lines is proposed. For the off-chip output transformer, impedance trajectory for the wide band impedance matching is presented using a T-equivalent circuit of the transformer. The self-inductance ratio of the transformer is optimized to maximize the bandwidth. Using the 5G new radio uplink signal with a signal bandwidth of 100 MHz, the implemented Doherty PA IC exhibited a power gain of 31.9 to 38.4 dB, PAE of 22.0 to 30.6%, and average output power of 26.0 to 27.8 dBm at a given ACLR of -33.0 dBc without pre-distortion.",en

New architectural‐structural‐seismic approach to stair designSummary This paper presents a new approach to the project of steel buildings, mainly focused on the architectural, structural, and seismic design of stairs. The objective is to design a structural stair system capable of controlling seismic damage and contributing to the bracing system of the building. The article begins with a review of the seismic standard (ATC, FEMA, and EC8) on which the current design criteria for new buildings with stairs are based. The research is based on two spatial building models (A–B) with the same bracing elements but placed differently. Reference Model A follows classical design approaches. It means, stairs are considered nonstructural elements that do not influence the seismic behavior of the building. This structure corresponds to typical braced frames (IV‐CBF and EBF) according to EC8. Model B includes a stair system designed to help control the effects of inter‐story drifts and inertia forces. In this case, the same bracing elements of Model A were integrated into the stair structure of Model B. A comparative seismic behavior analysis of typically braced frames (A) versus specially braced stairs (B) is presented. The research was based on the static nonlinear (pushover) analysis and the capacity spectrum method (ATC‐40) according to the seismic performance levels (FEMA) and damage limitation (EC8). Finally, the braced stairs was verified via nonlinear time‐history analysis in order to better capture the structural safety of the evacuation routes and their influence on the behavior of the building. This deterministic analysis of the braced stairs verified satisfactory results compared to reference bracing systems.",en
https://openalex.org/W4376126413,2023,Engineering,"Progressive collapse of steel structures exposed to fire: A critical reviewA state-of-the-art review is presented on design and research related to progressive collapse of steel structures under fire conditions. The influence of load ratios, strength of structural members, fire scenarios on the collapse behavior of structures is comprehensively reviewed. The corresponding mitigation measures and quantitative assessment methods are summarized. The existing experimental works are limited to low-rise buildings, plane frames or scaled models due to cost and safety issues, while numerical works involve high-rise buildings, three-dimensional models, full scales and various influencing factors. It is found that these influencing factors as well as fire protections and bracing systems significantly affect whether, how and when a structure collapses. Whether a structure collapses in fire essentially depends on the location of fire, heating rates, peak temperatures and duration of fire. Three collapse modes of global lateral drift collapse, global downward collapse and combined lateral-downward collapse are concluded for steel framed structures in fire. Three-dimensional models are recommended to make an accurate prediction of collapse modes of structures exposed to various fire scenarios. The determination of collapse time of structures under fire is a complicated process, and it is suggested to divide it into safe, alert, dangerous and collapse stages. This can provide three collapse warning levels of stay in, ready to evacuate and must evacuate. Further work is still needed on fire experiments considering collapse purpose, large structural scale and realistic fire conditions (cooling phase and fire spread) to achieve the real fire-induced collapse mechanism of structures and validate numerical models.",en

In order to study the influence of the airflow in the chamber and the slider shape on the reversing process, the fluid flow in the valve chamber of a four-way reversing valve is obtained using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, and the influence of the slider structure on slider thrust and resistance of the four-way reversing valve is analyzed. Four-way reversing valves with no-cutting, straight-cutting and arc-cutting sliders are employed to evaluate the reversing characteristics. A pressure measuring device for a four-way reversing valve chamber is designed, which is performed to test the chamber pressure of three different types of sliders of four-way reversing valves. The maximum error of experimental tests and simulations is within 5% of engineering tolerance, so as to verify the reliability of numerical simulation. The resistance-to-thrust ratio of the slider is raised to evaluate the performance of the reversing, which can guide the design of the valve and slider. The results indicate that the chamber pressure and resistance-thrust ratio with the cutting slider are reduced, which is beneficial to the reversing of the four-way reversing valve. Compared with the straight-cutting structure, the arc-cutting slider four-way reversing valve has a more stable reversing process and better comprehensive reversing performance. Results demonstrate that both the straight-cutting structure and arc-cutting structure of the slider can improve the process performance but the arc-cutting slider is better.",en

The supply voltage, power consumption and chip area of the proposed LNA can be reduced using forward body biasing, folded cascode topology and a feedback capacitor. Moreover, a wideband gain‐enhancement‐and‐image‐rejection (WGEIR) circuit including a variable resonant LC tank and a common‐gate amplifier has been developed. The inductance of the variable resonant LC tank can enlarge the gain of the proposed LNA. The capacitance of the variable resonant LC tank can achieve the image rejection. Using the WGEIR circuit, gain enhancement and wideband image rejection can be achieved simultaneously. The variable inductors and capacitors are developed for suppressing wideband image signals and good image rejection ratio (IRR). The combination of the variable inductors and capacitors can achieve eight image‐reject frequencies under three control voltages. The proposed LNA shows the measured results including a 10‐dB power gain, a 3‐dB noise figure (NF) and a −11‐dBm input third‐order intercept point ( IIP 3 ) at 2.4 GHz, respectively.

The proposed VDBC circuit integrates a conventional voltage doubler (VD) circuit with a step-up DC-DC converter circuit in modes 1–4, while a non-linear synchronisation procedure of a conventional boost converter circuit is employed in modes 5–6. This integration acted as the voltage boost circuit without utilising duty cycles and complex auxiliary switching components. In addition, the circuit does not require external trigger signals to turn on the bidirectional switches. This facilitates the operation of VDBC circuit at very low AC voltage (Vac ≥ 0.5 V). Besides this, the electrical characteristics of VDBC circuit’s input (i.e., PD) perfectly concurs with the studied testing scenarios using impedance power sources (mechanical shaker). Firstly, the proposed circuit which can rectify the PD’s output was tested at both constant input voltage with varying excitation frequency and constant excitation frequency with varying input voltage. Next, a small-scale solar battery was charged to validate the feasibility of the performance of the proposed VDBC circuit. The proposed circuit achieved a maximum output voltage of 11.7 Vdc with an output power of 1.37 mW. In addition, the rectified voltage waveform is stable due to the sminimisation of the ripples. In addition, the performance of VDBC circuit was verified by comparing the achieved results with previously published circuits in the literature. The results show that the proposed VDBC circuit outperformed existing units as described in the literature regarding output voltage and power. The developed rectifier circuit is suitable for various real-life applications such as energy harvesting and battery charging.",en

In order to simulate tire wear, a finite element model for tire wear was established using the UMESHMOTION subroutine and Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) adaptive meshing in ABAQUS, which is based on the Archard theory. The tire’s cornering characteristics were analyzed based on the obtained worn tire. The research results demonstrate that as the wear amount increases, the cornering stiffness and aligning stiffness of the tire also increase. When there are differences in wear on both tire shoulders with the same global wear, the change in cornering stiffness is not significant, while the aligning stiffness exhibits noticeable differences. To explain the above phenomenon, grounding characteristics were incorporated as mediator variables. The analysis results indicate that wear has an impact on the grounding characteristics. Additionally, statistically significant correlations exist between grounding parameters and cornering characteristics. In conclusion, wear affects the tire’s cornering characteristics by changing the grounding characteristics.",en

The intervention aims at enhancing the overall seismic resistance of RC framed structures with a light, cost-effective, sustainable, and reversible approach, allowing possible integration with energy efficiency upgrades. The retrofit technique relies on cross-laminated timber (CLT) panels mechanically connected through steel fasteners to the RC frame. This strengthening technique is investigated experimentally for the first time in this paper. The study examines two intervention configurations with different degrees of invasiveness: the first (RC-TP) involves replacing the existing masonry infill wall with a CLT panel, whereas the latter (RC-TPext) consists in applying the panel to the outer face of the frame. Both retrofit configurations were assessed experimentally through cyclic quasi-static in-plane tests on full-scale single-storey, single-bay RC frames. The frames were identical in geometry and characterised by poor mechanical material properties and steel reinforcement details, promoting the development of a strong-beam-weak-column mechanism. The experiments comprised tests on four specimens: a non-retrofitted masonry-infilled frame employed as a reference specimen and three frames strengthened with CLT panels as infills or externally connected retrofitting elements. The paper presents construction details of the strengthening interventions, demonstrates a step-by-step application procedure, and summarises the main observations from the tests, illustrating the evolution of structural damage, the ultimate failure mode, and the cyclic hysteretic response of the specimens. The experiments showed promising results, proving that both retrofit configurations improved the seismic behaviour of the RC frames considerably.

At the same time, both configurations prevented the shear collapse of the columns.",en
https://openalex.org/W4381326085,2023,Engineering,"Does ABS ensure good performance in emergency braking for less skilled motorcyclists?This study aims to investigate whether motorcyclists are able to use the full potential of anti-lock braking systems (ABS) in demanding braking situations that maintain the natural coupling of action and perception of emergency events, or whether instead the lack of braking skills in riders makes ABS almost ineffective and comparable to non-ABS brakes on dry pavement. Six experienced riders performed two experimental tests. First test included 12 emergency braking trials in a realistic scenario using a mock-up of an intersection conflict with a car initiating a left turn manoeuvre across the path (LTAP) of a motorcycle approaching from the opposite direction as an unpredicted moving hazard. Second test included three trials in a planned self-timed hard braking. The speed at the onset of braking was 35–45 km/h. The braking performance was measured from the initiation of brake pressure until the full stop of the vehicle. Front wheel ABS usage was determined by the pressure in the master cylinder and wheel callipers. The testing resulted in 85 data runs with full stop braking manoeuvres. Results revealed four categories of riders classified by their front wheel ABS usage during the emergency braking tests, which included two riders who underused front wheel ABS (9.6% and 27.4% of braking time on average). The worst case resulted in a significantly longer braking distance (braking deceleration of 5.2 m/s2). The highest skilled rider, who reached initial jerks close to 30 m/s3, used the ABS of the front wheel 93.7% of the braking time on average, resulting in a braking deceleration of 7.71 m/s2. Overall, the best braking performance was achieved in trials where the front ABS was activated for more than 80% of the braking. In planned self-timed hard braking test, where riders have more time to plan the braking manoeuvre, the experience rider with lowest performance during the emergency braking test improved braking efficiency and was able to increase ABS activation from 9.6% to 26.8% of the time, achieving a deceleration of 6.24 m/s2. ABS is demonstrated to reduce stopping distances and to improve stability under all braking conditions, but such features are not enough to guarantee a good braking performance in emergency events if the riders have not the skills to utilize the full braking power of the motorcycle. Less skilled riders, even with ABS, may not have the confidence to increase braking power further when reaching high decelerations that push them to the limit of their stabilisation control in emergency braking, thus increasing braking distance with potentially life-threatening consequences. Our results suggest that many experience riders still need knowledge and skill to make the ABS work to its optimum in emergency events to avoid crashes. Further research with larger sample sizes including the full diversity of the motorcyclist population is recommended to determine the actual proportion of motorcyclists underusing ABS.",en

Currently, the industry is developing some innovative mooring designs and new mooring components to reduce mooring costs, increase installation and hook-up effectiveness and ultimately reduce the environmental impact. We propose a new mooring design, the V-Share mooring system, with two lines connecting from two different floater columns to one anchor. Each mooring cluster is ""V-shaped,"" looking down from the sea surface. An anchor attached to multiple mooring lines has been field proven with mooring lines from different floaters sharing anchors. Therefore, all mooring components and installation technologies are field-proven. Numerical simulations verify the effectiveness of the V-Share mooring. Different engineering aspects are discussed, including mooring installation and floater hook-up. We started with the theoretical analysis for a spread mooring system stiffness in the surge, sway, and yaw directions to demonstrate that the restoring stiffness from the V-Share mooring, as a new system, is comparable to the traditional mooring. Numerical tools further verify this through the restoring stiffness numerical calculations. The comparisons show that the V-Share mooring provides similar horizontal and vertical restoring stiffness and higher yaw stiffness than the traditional moorings. In the case studies, we used one polyester rope semi-taut mooring system and one wire rope catenary mooring system on three-column semi-submersibles with large wind turbines to conduct fully-coupled simulations. The results confirm the similar tension, offsets, and more stable platform motions in the yaw and heel angles. In addition, the V-Share mooring system allows the possibility of hooking up two lines simultaneously. For each FOWT, the V-Share mooring pattern reduces the mooring system footprint and anchor number and achieves savings in CAPEX, geotechnical surveys, transportation, and installation. Moreover, the V-Share mooring is naturally feasible for shared anchors between different floaters in a wind farm, further reducing project costs. The FOWTs are moving into deeper waters with larger turbines. Multiple mooring lines and large mooring sizes present significant technical and commercial challenges. The V-Share mooring pattern reduces floater motions, mooring footprint, and the number of anchors. It allows for simplified installation procedures and has the potential to improve wind power generation efficiency. The V-Share mooring system can be combined with innovative mooring components or materials to reduce costs further and is also applicable for floaters in other industries such as floating solar or fish farming.",en

To investigate the strength of the tanks, a universal test bench was developed and calibrated for use in both burst and fatigue tests. The obtained experimental results in terms of burst and fatigue failure locations for each brand of tank are compared with the results obtained using finite element based simulations. Visual solid models in 3D were drawn in SolidWorks and then ANSYS software was used to perform Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulations on those LPG cylinders to obtain the results, such as stresses, deformations, burst and fatigue failure locations. As a result of this comparison, it has been observed that some brands of cylindrical LPG tanks are more durable and safe for use in vehicles. Since the same standard requirements and the same commercial material are used in LPG tank production, it is revealed that some companies need to reconsider their design, manufacturing and especially welding processes.

Furthermore, the simultaneous influx of a large number of mobile users may cause serious network congestion. Aiming at these problems, this article proposes a novel authentication scheme supporting multi-user access, which fully considers the scenarios of intra-domain handover and inter-domain handover across AMF. Using the characteristics of the network architecture integrated with mobile edge computing (MEC) and software-defined networks (SDN), the user's moving path can be predicted in advance to speed up the handover process. Most importantly, the proposed scheme can perform secure, efficient and flexible mutual authentication and key agreement between the group and the core network by using aggregated message authentication codes with detecting functionality (AMAD) and contributory broadcast encryption technique. Through the use of BAN Logic and Scyther tool verification, the proposed scheme can not only realize multiple user authentication and key agreement, but also fulfill various security goals. Performance evaluations demonstrate that the proposed scheme has moderate computational and communication overhead, and lower transmission overhead compared with existing schemes, which can effectively reduce authentication delay.",en

The main work is as follows: firstly, the lightweight network G-Backbone and G-Neck network layers are constructed to reduce the number of parameters and computation of the network structure. Secondly, convolutional coordinate attention is incorporated into the G-Backbone to embed location information into channel attention, which enables the network to obtain location information of a larger area through multiple convolutions and enhances the expression ability of mobile network learning features. In addition, the Concat module in the original feature fusion is modified into a weighted bi-directional feature pyramid W-BiFPN with settable learning weights to improve the feature fusion capability and achieve efficient weighted feature fusion and bi-directional cross-scale connectivity. Finally, the Loss function EIOU Loss is introduced to split the influence factor of the aspect ratio and calculate the length and width of the target frame and anchor frame, respectively, combined with Focal-EIOU Loss to solve the problem of imbalance between complex and easy samples. Meta-ACON’s activation function is introduced to achieve an adaptive selection of whether to activate neurons and improve the detection accuracy.

FER remains challenging due to facial accessories, non-uniform illumination, pose variation, etc. Emotion detection exploiting conventional algorithms has the demerit of mutual optimization of classification and feature extraction. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can be employed to identify FER automatically. Deep learning (DL) driven FER models have recently allowed for designing an end-to-end learning process.

Unfortunately, huge memory size, computational cost and bandwidth requirements limit its practicality. We present BASALISC, an architecture family of hardware accelerators that aims to substantially accelerate FHE computations in the cloud. BASALISC is the first to implement the BGV scheme with fully-packed bootstrapping – the noise removal capability necessary for arbitrary-depth computation. It supports a customized version of bootstrapping that can be instantiated with hardware multipliers optimized for area and power.BASALISC is a three-abstraction-layer RISC architecture, designed for a 1 GHz ASIC implementation and underway toward 150mm2 die tape-out in a 12nm GF process.

https://openalex.org/W4321021723,2023,Computer science,"CoDi$: Randomized Caches Through Confusion and DiffusionCloud providers are increasingly exposed to malicious actors through transient attacks, such as Spectre and Meltdown. The cache hierarchy is the main target to build the required side-channels to leak data. Randomized caches can be employed to provide security but often rely on cryptographic primitives to deter side-channel attacks. These increase the access latency and deteriorates the system performance. This paper shows that randomized caches do not have to increase the cache access latency, and that their security does not have to rely on a cryptographic hash function or block-cipher. Herein, CoDi$ is proposed, a randomized last level cache that achieves security by tying the local and global states. Security is achieved through a higher miss energy consumption and occupied area, instead of penalizing performance. CoDi$ is able to evict any cached address by allowing addresses to be displaced in two levels of freedom, through hopscotch (local state) and cuckoo hashing (global state), without increasing the hit latency. Through these displacements, paths can be built to the eviction address. The security of CoDi$ relies on the hardness to control all possible displacement paths when a miss occurs, which requires control over the local and global states of the cache simultaneously. Confusion is generated when evicting an address, as there are many possible cache states that could result from this eviction. Also, for each executed eviction, multiple addresses in the cache are non-deterministically displaced, providing diffusion. Moreover, experimental analysis for a 48-bit secure CoDi$, using SPEC, NPB, and Polybench benchmarks, shows improvements in the number of instructions per cycle and up to 5% in misses, when compared to two state-of-the-art randomized caches.",en

However, the conventional paradigm governing drive testing, which entails the deployment of either radio frequency equipment or software solutions such as TEMS Investigation accompanied by GPS and an MS (Mobile Station), is marred by inherent limitations that hinder precision in data collection spatiality and necessitate a cumbersome use of multiple tools. In our work, we embark on a novel trajectory, anchoring our non-invasive drive test methodology on the potency of a wearable device such as smart phones. Inspired by this, we design an Android-based drive test platform that stands as a fulcrum of innovation. This platform consists primarily of a mobile application that acts as a measuring instrument, and an API to relay the data collected by the mobile application. This Android-based approach provides operators with heightened precision in both location determination and parameter measurements.

They commit crimes like installing malware on the victim's computer, stealing private data from the victim's system, and exposing the victim online. Malicious codes can also be found on legitimate websites. Therefore, locating such a website in cyberspace is a difficult operation that demands the utilization of an automated detection tool. Currently, machine learning/deep learning technologies are employed to detect such malicious websites. However, the problem persists since the attack vector is constantly changing. Most research solutions use a limited number of URL lexical features, DNS information, global ranking information, and webpage content features. Combining several derived features involves computation time and security risk. Additionally, the dataset's minimal features don't maximize its potential.

It has been shown to be computationally efficient and able to handle complex models and data sets. Yet, the available approach cannot handle the in experimental studies ubiquitous case of missing data, and might provide incorrect posterior estimates. In this work, we discuss various ways of encoding missing data and integrate them into the training and inference process. We implement the approaches in the BayesFlow methodology, an amortized estimation framework based on invertible neural networks, and evaluate their performance on multiple test problems. We find that an approach in which the data vector is augmented with binary indicators of presence or absence of values performs the most robustly. Accordingly, we demonstrate that amortized simulation-based inference approaches are applicable even with missing data, and we provide a guideline for their handling, which is relevant for a broad spectrum of applications.",en

One device that is vulnerable to data security is RFID. One way to increase its security is to embed a cryptosystem in it. The NTRU algorithm can be a solution because of its low computational power. However, ECC is widely used because its computational power requirements are lower than other traditional public key algorithms. This research proposes the implementation and performance analysis of the ECC and NTRU algorithms on RFID devices. Testing is carried out by running 100-400 RFID devices simultaneously. The key generation and ECC decryption processes were faster than NTRU. The NTRU encryption process is faster than ECC. The ECC algorithm is more efficient and suitable for RFID devices. However, ECC is vulnerable to invalid curve attacks that can attack at the recommended security level. In NTRU, there is also a vulnerability to attacks using the LLL algorithm, but these attacks cannot yet attack the recommended security level. For this reason, the NTRU algorithm is more suitable for use on RFID devices, provided that the RFID device must increase its resources for computational needs heavier than ECC.",en

In physical layer, the mobile reception performance loss of LTE-based 5G terrestrial broadcast majorly stems from numerology, coded modulation, interleave depth and channel estimation. Among these factors, interleave depth directly affects the mobile reception performance at different speeds, and low-speed mobile reception puts forward higher requirements of interleave depth. In this paper, the typical configuration of LTE-based 5G terrestrial broadcast is selected, and how interleave depth influences the mobile reception performance is revealed based on the analysis of average mutual information (AMI) probability density distribution and outage probability over small-scale Rayleigh fading channels. The analysis results show that the mobile reception performance could be significantly improved by appropriately increasing the interleave depth.

In recent years, the network intrusion detection system based on anomaly detection has attracted widespread attention because it can detect unknown attacks. Introduction Mobile ad hoc network is a wireless network, which is composed of mobile nodes. These nodes can communicate with each other without using fixed infrastructure. Communication between nodes is based on routing protocols such as distance vector protocol (DV), link state protocol (LSP) and hybrid protocol. Mobile ad hoc networks have applications in many applications, such as sensor networks, vehicle networks, wireless sensor networks, and so on.

Existing DRL-based controllers are trained with a simplified data hall thermodynamic model which assumes uniform room temperature distribution. This assumption is not valid for a real-world data center with highly nonuniform temperature distribution. Furthermore, most of them cannot guarantee thermal safety during the DRL learning process. To bridge these gaps, we propose LyaSafe, a model-assisted safe DRL approach for data center cooling control. To address the safety evaluation issue, we develop a coupled model that combines a differentiable surrogate data hall thermodynamics model with the energy model. It can simulate both data hall temperature distribution and the facility energy consumption. To address safe learning, we introduce a novel constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) formulation for data center cooling control by considering the Rack Cooling Index (RCI), the best-practice metric for evaluating compliance with ASHRAE data center thermal guidelines. The objective is to minimize data center carbon footprints while regulating the RCI within a threshold. We first derive the safety set based on the concept of the virtual queue and Lyapunov stability theory. Next, we rectify unsafe actions from the DRL agent by projecting them to the safety set. We evaluate LyaSafe in a data center hosting 20 racks and 299 servers. Evaluation results show that LyaSafe can ensure strict safety during the DRL learning while achieving up to 50 metric tons of annual carbon emission savings using Singapore’s statistics. Moreover, we conduct root cause analysis for the savings, revealing the importance of joint control of the data hall and the chiller plant.",en

For many developing countries, shifting to modern pressurized irrigation is hampered by system and energy costs. Gated pipes are an improvement on furrow irrigation. They offer an affordable modernization option for traditional surface systems. Designed to operate at low pressure, gated pipes have the potential to reduce conveyance losses, improve application uniformity, and minimize runoff, which is often responsible for spreading waterborne diseases and lowering water quality. However, very little pertinent data are available on their performance. In this paper, a new model (OptGate) for the design and performance analysis of self-compensated (SC) and conventional rectangular (CG) gated pipes is described and field validated. OptGate proved its reliability in simulating the discharges along the gated pipe with RMSE = 0.29 and 0.119 m3/h for CG and SC, respectively, under a range of streaming head pressures ranging from 2 to 10 m with a 2-m step.

However, the existing SAR super-resolution (SR) methods usually reconstruct the images by a determined degradation model and hardly consider multiplicative speckle noise, meanwhile, most SR models are trained with synthetic datasets in which the low-resolution (LR) images are down-sampled from their high-resolution (HR) counterparts. These constraints cause a serious domain gap between the synthetic and real SAR images. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes an unsupervised blind SR method for SAR images by introducing SAR priors in a cycle-GAN framework. First, a learnable probabilistic degradation model combined with SAR noise priors was presented to satisfy various SAR images produced from different platforms. Then, a degradation model and a SR model in a unified cycle-GAN framework were trained simultaneously to learn the intrinsic relationship between HR–LR domains. The model was trained with real LR and HR SAR images instead of synthetic paired images to conquer the domain gap. Finally, experimental results on both synthetic and real SAR images demonstrated the high performance of the proposed method in terms of image quality and visual perception. Additionally, we found the proposed SR method demonstrates the tremendous potential for target detection tasks by reducing missed detection and false alarms significantly.",en

Considering that it is hard and expensive to obtain attack data, it is more reasonable to develop a model trained with only normal data. However, both high-dimensional data and the presence of outliers in the training set result in efficiency degradation. In this research, we present a hybrid intrusion detection method to overcome these two problems. First, we created an improved autoencoder that incorporates the deep support vector data description (Deep SVDD) loss into the training of the autoencoder. Under the combination of Deep SVDD loss and reconstruction loss, the novel autoencoder learns a more compact latent representation from high-dimensional data. The density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm is then used to remove potential outliers in the training data. Finally, a Bayesian Gaussian mixture model is used to identify anomalies. It learns the distribution of the filtered training data and uses the probabilities to classify normal and anomalous samples. We conducted a series of experiments on two intrusion detection datasets to assess performance. The proposed model performs better than other baseline methods when dealing with high-dimensional and contaminated data.",en

This makes its yield prediction essential for both economics and sustainability. The potential cotton yield can be predicted by integrating climatic factors, soil parameters, and biophysical parameters observed by high temporal & spatial resolution remote sensing satellites. This study used a multisource dataset to create an explainable and accurate predictive model for cotton yield prediction over the continental US (CONUS). A recently proposed glass-box method called Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM), which provides transparency, reliability, and ease of interpretation, was implemented. Accuracy performance was compared with common machine learning (ML) methods for predicting cotton yields. The EBM showed higher accuracy against other glass-box methods and competitive results with black-box models. With the help of the EBM, the importance of individual features and their pairwise interactions was revealed without applying any post-hoc methods. The study findings showed that the precipitation (P), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and leaf area index (LAI) are the three most important dynamic features. The dynamic features are the driver of the created model with 78% of the overall feature importance, followed by pairwise interactions of the features with 16% contribution. Lastly, static features contribute 6% to the overall feature importance.

To achieve the effect of secure deletion, overwritten-based secure deletion techniques have been proposed to overwrite invalidated storage space with scrambled data content. Nevertheless, overwritten-based secure deletion requires explicit write requests for rewriting invalidated storage space with random data, thus incurring additional internal write traffic on storage devices. Recently, this inefficient aspect of secure deletion is exacerbated by the emergence of high-density interlaced magnetic recording (IMR) technology. IMR technology enhances the storage density of hard disk drives by interlacing narrower top tracks on wider bottom tracks. Owing to the interlaced track layout, securely erasing invalidated data on bottom tracks interferes with adjacent top tracks and track rewrites are required to preserve valid data on top tracks; thus, overwritten-based secure deletion on IMR drives significantly enlarges the internal write traffic and impairs the secure deletion efficiency. In this paper, instead of directly alleviating the constraint induced by the interlaced track layout, we propose leveraging the interlaced track layout of IMR drives in combination with the journaling data stream of journaling file systems to enable prompt secure data deletion while minimizing the write traffic of secure deletion operations. Experimental results suggest that the performance improvement achieve by the proposed prompt secure deletion (P-SD) strategy is 51.84% on average, when compared with the previous TrackLace approach on IMR drives.",en

Rapidly developing Persistent Memory (PM) offers new opportunities to PSs owing to its large capacity at low costs, as well as its persistence, while the application of PM also faces two challenges including high read latency and heavy CPU burden.

The reliability of data dissemination in the IoT environment completely depends on the secure neighbor discovery mechanism that are utilized for effective and efficient communication among the sensor nodes. Secure neighbor discovery mechanisms that significantly determine trustworthy sensor nodes are essential for maintaining potential connectivity and sustaining reliable data delivery in the energy-constrained self organizing WSN. In this paper, Fuzzy Technique of Order Preference Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)-based Secure Neighbor Discovery Mechanism (FTOPSIS-SNDM) is proposed for estimating the trust of each sensor node in the established routing path for the objective of enhancing reliable data delivery in WSNs. This proposed FTOPSIS-SNDM is proposed as an attempt to integrate the merits of Fuzzy Set Theory (FST) and TOPSIS-based Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach, since the discovery of secure neighbors involves the exchange of imprecise data and uncertain behavior of sensor nodes. This secure neighbor is also influenced by the factors of packet forwarding potential, delay, distance from the Base Station (BS) and residual energy, which in turn depends on multiple constraints that could be possibly included into the process of secure neighbor discovery.

Conventional transmission schemes are ill-suited to provide ultrareliable, lowlatency, and scalability requirements of IoT networks with the massive number of nodes having sporadic data traffic behavior. This article overcomes such challenges with proposing a random access transmission scheme that exploits nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with short-packet transmissions and automatic request and repeat (ARQ) strategy with the limited number of retransmissions. To utilize the spectrum further and to meet ultrareliable low-latency requirement, an adaptive–persistent technique is proposed in which each node distributively controls its transmission based on the number of active devices without extra signaling. Since the nodes’ data traffic behavior is assumed sporadic, NOMA-based clustering is performed dynamically at each frame, avoiding additional signaling overhead. Network metrics, such as reliability, effective sum rate, and the distribution of packet latency, are analytically derived. Furthermore, the effects of different network parameters, such as blocklength, the maximum number of packet replicas, number of nodes, and number of resource blocks on network metrics, are investigated and compared with S-ALOHA-ARQ. The analysis show that the proposed scheme outperforms conventional schemes in terms of effective sum rate, reliability, and average packet latency.",en

It is equipped without a microphone where users can control the robot with spoken commands; the voice commands are then recognized by a well-trained deep neural network model of automatic speech recognition (ASR), which enables the robot to execute and complete the command based on the navigation of a real-time simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm. The voice interaction recognition model is divided into two parts: (1) speaker separation and (2) ASR. The speaker separation is applied by a deep-learning system consisting of eight convolution layers, one LSTM layer, and two fully connected (FC) layers to separate the speaker’s voice. This model recognizes the speaker’s voice as a referrer that separates and holds the required voiceprint and removes noises from other people’s voiceprints. Its automatic speech recognition uses the novel sandwich-type conformer model with a stack of three layers, and combines convolution and self-attention to capture short-term and long-term interactions. Specifically, it contains a multi-head self-attention module to directly convert the voice data into text for command realization.

Performance analysis was applied to determine the robot’s environment isolation and voice recognition abilities. The results showed that the practical robot system successfully completed the interactive service tasks in a real environment.

It also verified that the designed voice interaction recognition system enables the mobile robot to execute tasks in real-time, showing that it is a convenient way to complete the assigned service applications.",en

However, IDD requires the exchange of soft information between the detector and decoder, thus decoders should be able to process soft input and provide soft output (SISO). Existing SISO polar decoders such as belief propagation (BP) and soft cancellation (SCAN) give poor block error rate (BLER) performance compared with cyclic redundancy check (CRC)-aided successive cancellation list (CA-SCL) decoders, whereas other more sophisticated SISO decoders have high complexity albeit good BLER performance. In this paper, an efficient SISO decoder that provides both high BLER performance and low complexity is proposed for polar codes in IDD system. Specifically, the proposed SISO decoder employs the sum-product algorithm over the sparse parity-check matrix representation of polar codes for lower complexity and uses the best candidates from list decoders for good error correction performance. We comprehensively evaluate the proposed SISO decoder performance in MIMO iterative system.

https://openalex.org/W4319915909,2023,Computer science,"Virtual cell modeling and simulation softwareVirtual Cell (VCell, http://vcell.org) is free open-source software for modeling cell biological systems. Biology-based interface is designed for researchers with no programming/scripting experience: they enter reactions and reaction rules in an intuitive graphical way, and VCell automatically creates the math for you. Models and simulations can be accessed from anywhere using the VCell database; models can be shared among collaborators or made publicly available. Simulations can be run locally (on a user's computer) or using our server - a job can be sent to a server and results can be retrieved any time later. VCell provides a variety of simulation frameworks. The same reaction network can be simulated using deterministic (compartmental ODE) and/or stochastic reactions (SSA solvers) simulators. By adding a geometry for compartments and diffusion for species, the same reaction network can be simulated as a reaction-diffusion-advection PDE with support for 2D kinematics and/or using spatial stochastic (reaction-diffusion with Smoldyn, http://smoldyn.org). Geometries from 2D or 3D microscope images or from idealized analytical expressions can be used, and membrane flux, lateral membrane diffusion and electrophysiology could be incorporated. If elements of the model are defined by reaction rules (using a novel graphical user interface for defining, visualizing, and verifying rule-based models), the model can be simulated using BioNetGen (http://bionetgen.org) engine and/or network-free agent-based simulations. The VCell models can be exchanged with other tools using standard formats such as SBML and BNGL, as well as exported as MatLab, SED-ML, and COMBINE archive. The latest developments include better support of SBML features, the possibility to fully annotate the models, view models online, interact with ImageJ, and send simulations to runBiosimulations (https://run.biosimulations.org) service for online simulations and visualization with modified parameters.

Hence, it is usually difficult to obtain well-focused images for such sparse aperture ISAR data. To address this issue, a novel general analysis model with tight frame for sparse ISAR imaging is proposed in this paper, which operates directly on the ISAR image instead of the redundant sparse coefficient. Furthermore, with the help of projection operator and majorization minimization algorithmic framework, a simple and effective accelerated iterative algorithm AIA-GAM is designed to solve the proposed ISAR imaging model, which only performs the simple proximal mapping in each iteration. The experiment results of simulation data and real measured data demonstrate that the proposed method has better imaging performance and faster convergence speed.",en
https://openalex.org/W4387928917,2023,Computer science,"The Importance of Anti-Aliasing in Tiny Object DetectionTiny object detection has gained considerable attention in the research community owing to the frequent occurrence of tiny objects in numerous critical real-world scenarios. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used as the backbone for object detection architectures typically neglect Nyquist's sampling theorem during down-sampling operations, resulting in aliasing and degraded performance. This is likely to be a particular issue for tiny objects that occupy very few pixels and therefore have high spatial frequency features. This paper applied an existing approach WaveCNet for anti-aliasing to tiny object detection. WaveCNet addresses aliasing by replacing standard down-sampling processes in CNNs with Wavelet Pooling (WaveletPool) layers, effectively suppressing aliasing. We modify the original WaveCNet to apply WaveletPool in a consistent way in both pathways of the residual blocks in ResNets. Additionally, we also propose a bottom-heavy version of the backbone, which further improves the performance of tiny object detection while also reducing the required number of parameters by almost half. Experimental results on the TinyPerson, WiderFace, and DOTA datasets demonstrate the importance of anti-aliasing in tiny object detection and the effectiveness of the proposed method which achieves new state-of-the-art results on all three datasets.

This paper investigates an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided multi-tier hybrid computing system that can achieve mutual benefits for DT and MEC in the DITEN. For the first time, this paper presents the opportunity to realize the network-wide convergence of DT and MEC. In the considered system, specifically, over-the-air computation (AirComp) is employed to monitor the status of the DT system, while MEC is performed with the assistance of DT to provide low-latency computing services. Besides, the IRS is utilized to enhance signal transmission and mitigate interference among heterogeneous nodes. We propose a framework for designing the hybrid computing system, aiming to maximize the sum computation rate under communication and computation resources constraints. To tackle the non-convex optimization problem, alternative optimization and successive convex approximation techniques are leveraged to decouple variables and then transform the problem into a more tractable form. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate the IRS can significantly improve the system performance with appropriate phase shift configurations. Moreover, the results indicate that the DT assisted MEC system can precisely achieve the balance between local computing and task offloading since real-time system status can be obtained with the help of DT.",en

However, in today's digital age, civil registration systems face numerous security challenges that jeopardize the integrity and confidentiality of vital information. This paper highlights some of the key security challenges encountered in civil registration systems and outlines potential strategies to address them. Firstly, the digitization of civil registration processes has opened new avenues for cyber threats. Malicious actors may attempt to compromise the security of databases, manipulate or steal vital records, or disrupt services through cyberattacks. Robust cybersecurity measures, including encryption, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and regular security audits, are essential to safeguard sensitive data and ensure the continuity of civil registration operations. Secondly, the issue of identity theft poses a significant challenge to civil registration security. Fraudulent practices, such as the creation of fake identities or the alteration of existing records, can undermine the trustworthiness of the system and lead to the misallocation of resources. The implementation of identity verification mechanisms, such as biometrics or unique identifiers, can enhance the accuracy and integrity of civil registration data while reducing the risk of identity fraud. Thirdly, ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of individuals' personal information is critical in civil registration systems. With the increasing digitization and interconnectedness of data, there is a heightened risk of unauthorized access or data breaches. Strong data protection regulations, robust access controls, and encryption techniques can help mitigate these risks, fostering public trust and confidence in civil registration processes. Moreover, the challenge of inclusivity must be addressed to ensure the effectiveness and reliability of civil registration systems. Marginalized populations, including refugees, migrants, and those residing in remote areas, may face barriers in accessing civil registration services, leaving them vulnerable to identity-related challenges. Deploying mobile registration units, leveraging innovative technologies, and promoting community engagement are strategies that can improve inclusivity and extend the benefits of civil registration to all individuals.",en
https://openalex.org/W4316036778,2023,Computer science,"Improved ship imaging algorithm for geosynchronous synthetic aperture radar (SAR) featured by subaperture time window selection optimization and inverse SAR translational compensationAn inverse synthetic aperture radar processing-based algorithm is improved for ship imaging in geosynchronous synthetic aperture radars (GEO SARs) to solve the technical challenges including long accumulation time and complex target motion characteristics. The improvement on the existing algorithm mainly involves four aspects. First, the formula for calculating the appropriate time length of subaperture is derived, according to the principle that the accumulated power of the ship’s echo corresponding to the subaperture duration ensures that the signal-to-noise ratio satisfies the requirement of GEO SARs. The derived formula solves the problem that how long the subaperture length should be taken with regards to a long accumulation time of GEO SAR when imaging ships. Second, we propose an optimization criterion for determining the appropriate subaperture time window by ensuring that the maximum number of ship pixels is detected in the subaperture image. The proposed criterion is used to optimize the location of the subaperture time window in the long accumulation time. Third, the SPECAN algorithm used in the scene imaging process is replaced by an improved nonlinear chirp scaling (NLCS) algorithm to improve the imaging accuracy of the scene. Our improvement on the traditional NLCS algorithm focuses on improving precisions of some of the formulas in the traditional algorithm. Furthermore, a translational compensation algorithm is proposed by considering the influence of spatial variance of slant range history of GEO SARs. The proposed translational compensation algorithm improves the compensation accuracy since the spatial variance of different scatterers in the scene is considered. A series of simulation experiments related with ship imaging in GEO SARs were carried out to verify the correctness of the proposed algorithm and the improvement on the imaging quality compared with that of the existing algorithm.",en

Each logical network supports services with specific throughput and latency requirements. The fifth-generation(5G) and 5G-beyond networks employ more than two slices; hence, it has become necessary to deploy algorithms for efficient resource allocation. However, given the latency-sensitive applications, allocating resources to different slices based on the current demand would be a poor choice. Therefore, resource allocation needs to be performed in advance, which calls for forecasting algorithms predicting future demands. In this paper, we propose a novel predictive network slicing mechanism named NPRA to predict resources dynamically. NPRA predicts the future resource requirements using Unit Time Long Short-Term Memory (UT-LSTM). The predicted demand can be used as an input to any optimization algorithm for the timely allocation of resources. We also develop a 5G simulation testbed to generate datasets for performance study. The results presented demonstrate the effectiveness of NPRA.",en

Each of these computing paradigms has its own pros and cons. Cloud computing provides enhanced data storage and computing power but causes high communication latency. Edge and fog computing provide similar services with lower latency but limited capacity, capability, and coverage. A single computing paradigm cannot fulfill all the requirements of IoT devices and a federation between them is needed to extend their capacity, capability, and services. This federation is beneficial to both subscribers and providers and also reveals research issues in traffic offloading between clouds, edges, and fogs. Optimization has traditionally been used to solve the problem of traffic offloading. However, in such a complex federated system, traditional optimization cannot keep up with the strict latency requirements of decision-making, ranging from milliseconds to sub-seconds. Machine learning approaches, especially reinforcement learning, are consequently becoming popular because they could quickly solve offloading problems in dynamic environments with some unknown information. This study provides a novel federal classification between cloud, edge, and fog and presents a comprehensive research roadmap on offloading for different federated scenarios. We survey the relevant literature on the various optimization approaches used to solve this offloading problem and compare their salient features. We then provide a comprehensive survey on offloading in federated systems with machine learning approaches and the lessons learned as a result of these surveys. Finally, we outline several directions for future research and challenges that have to be faced in order to achieve such a federation.",en

https://openalex.org/W4385200025,2023,Geology,"Geochemistry and Mineralogy of Rare-Earth Elements in Ferruginous Deposits and Bottom Sediments of the Laptev SeaAbstract ––The geochemical and mineralogical aspects of the distribution of rare-earth elements (REE) in ferruginous deposits (FD) and bottom sediments of the southeastern Laptev Sea are analyzed. The FD are dominated by biomorphs developed after polychaete tubes. The REE patterns depend on the proportion of ore and non-ore substances. The ore substance is represented mainly by iron hydroxides (limonite). It is a product of suboxic diagenesis enhanced by bioturbation and determines the slight enrichment of FD in MREE and cerium deficiency (Cean = 0.94). The non-ore substance comes from terrigenous sediments and has an (alumino)silicate composition. It controls the scandium content and is the source of REE mineral grains, among which monazite-(Ce) prevails. The sediments demonstrate a common similarity in REE patterns to shales and suspended material transported to the Laptev Sea by the Lena River, with elevated LREE and MREE contents and the value of Ce anomaly almost equal to unity (Cean = 1.06). In the sediments, REE minerals occur mostly in the silt fraction (&amp;lt;63 μm in size). The high content of organic matter (Corg of up to 2.15%) of predominantly terrigenous origin (OMter of up to 85%) in the sediments explains the oxygen deficiency and weak diagenetic mineral formation with low accumulation of trace elements, including REE, in the FD. The total REE content in the FD is lower than that in the sediments (on average, 173 ppm against 206 ppm).",en

These mineralizations are mainly associated with widespread high-K magmatism in the Oligo-Miocene period. Of these the epithermal veins which have economic grade Au-Ag concentrations are generally found in volcanic rocks such as dacites, andesites, and pyroclastic rocks. The hydrothermal aureoles' interaction with highly permeable volcanic rocks caused voluminous alteration zones with potential precious metal enrichments. The K&amp;#305;sac&amp;#305;k (Biga Metallogenic Province of NW, Turkey) area can be considered as a promising precious metal mineralization zone due to the high-intensity alterations observed in Miocene volcanic rocks (dacites and pyroclastic rocks). In the study area, the hydrothermal activity can also be seen in basement metamorphic (calcschists) and ophiolitic (basalts - dolerites) rocks. The identified hydrothermal alterations in the field are sericitic and argillic alterations with intense silicifications. The silicifications are mostly observed in cracks and joint fractures of volcanic rocks in the form of veinlets and cavity fills. Major oxide-Trace Element and ICP-MS Ag-Au-PGE&amp;#8217;s analysis was performed on the samples taken from the field. The calculated alteration indexes (AI) are ranging between %82-99.2 and Chlorite-Carbonate-Pyrite Indexes (CCPI) values are between %73-97 according to major oxide values of altered volcanics. The Au content varies between 0.03 &amp;#8211; 21.34 ppm. When the hydrothermal trend is examined in the AI-CCPI diagram, the altered high grade volcanics shows a chlorite-sericite-pyrite alteration trend. These implications are parallel with field observations. The less altered volcanics are located within the andesite/basalt field. Highly altered volcanics are located in the ""ore center"" area of the diagram. The calculated alteration index (AI&amp;CCPI) values of the volcanic rocks are high, mainly caused by the removal of mobile cations such and a significant enrichment in immobile cations such as Al and Fe. In addition, a silica-carbonate alteration zone around ophiolitic rocks was observed and gold content of up to 0.16 ppm was detected in samples from this area which indicates a listwanite-type Au deposit.Keywords: Alteration indexes, Miocene Volcanics, Hydrothermal Deposits, Biga Peninsula, Turkey",en

A comprehensive study, including field observations, geochemical analyses and zircon U-Pb geochronological dating, was conducted on the Lanling HP-LT terrane to determine its protolith origin and the presubduction paleogeography of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean. The metabasites can be divided into two geochemical groups: Group A samples exhibit low TiO2 values (1.15–1.81 wt%) and subalkaline basalt affinity with rare earth element (REE) distribution patterns and trace element abundances similar to enriched mid-ocean ridge basalts (E-MORB); Group B samples have higher TiO2 values (2.75–3.32 wt%) and show alkaline basalt affinity and ocean island basalt (OIB) geochemical signatures. Lanling metabasites are likely derived from a long-depleted mantle source combined with crustal contamination based on the following evidence: (1) positive εNd(t) values (+4.8 to +5.6) and a scattered distribution of Isr(t) values (0.704684 to 0.710999), (2) abundant Precambrian zircon grains, and (3) a volcanic arc trend in the tectonic discrimination diagram. Zircon U–Pb dating yields a timing of ca. 272–241 Ma for the protolith age of the Lanling eclogites. The protoliths of the OIB- and E-MORB-type metabasites in Lanling are postulated to be ocean island magmatites and basaltic crust of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean, respectively. Moreover, the Lanling quartzose schists contain only ancient detrital zircons with ages of >500 Ma and show protolith lithostratigraphy and provenance similar to those of the late Paleozoic clastic flysch in the South Qiangtang block (SQB). Based on the above observations and other geological evidence, a hypothetical model of the Permian–Triassic ocean island and adjacent abyssal submarine fan in the Paleo-Tethys Ocean is proposed to explain the protolith origin of the Lanling HP-LT terrane and the presubduction paleogeography in central Qiangtang.",en

The Korean Peninsula is located at an intraplate region of the eastern Eurasian Plate and has been deformed under the ENE–WSW maximum horizontal compression since the late Pliocene. In this study, we analyzed short-term instrumental seismic (focal mechanism) and long-term paleoseismic (Quaternary fault outcrop) data to decipher the neotectonic crustal deformation pattern in the southeastern Korean Peninsula. Available (paleo-)seismic data acquired from an NNE–SSW trending deformation zone between the Yangsan and Ulleung fault zones indicate spatial partitioning of crustal deformation by NNW–SSE to NNE–SSW striking reverse faults and NNE–SSW striking strike-slip faults, supporting a strike-slip partitioned transpression model. The instantaneous and finite neotectonic strains, estimated from the focal mechanism and Quaternary outcrop data, respectively, show discrepancies in their axes, which can be attributed to the switching between extensional and intermediate axes of finite strain during the accumulation of wrench-dominated transpression. Notably, some major faults, including the Yangsan and Ulsan fault zones, are relatively misoriented to slip under the current stress condition but, paradoxically, have more (paleo-)seismic records indicating their role in accommodating the neotectonic transpressional strain. We propose that fluids, heat flow, and lithospheric structure are potential factors affecting the reactivation of the relatively misoriented major faults. Our findings provide insights into the accommodation pattern of strain associated with the neotectonic crustal extrusion in an intraplate region of the eastern Eurasian Plate in response to the collision of the Indian Plate and the subduction of the Pacific/Philippine Sea Plates.",en

In this study, we use a combined field, petrography, mineral chemistry, phase equilibria modeling and 40Ar/39Ar geochronology approach to characterize amphibole in gabbronorites from the Mesoarchean Lechana layered complex in eastern Botswana. To get a better understanding of the overprint events, the characteristics of amphibole in the spatially associated amphibolite are also included. The gabbronorite preserves magmatic cumulate texture, with brownish amphibole replacing pyroxene as widespread thin (up to 80 μm) rims. In comparison, the greenish amphibole in amphibolite form part of granoblastic polygonal texture. Amphibolite preserve evidence for anatectic and metasomatic overprints, while the gabbronorite only exhibit effects of the later. Phase equilibria modeling provide P-T conditions and H2O content for the amphibole formation in the gabbronorite. The 40Ar/39Ar geochronology gave an age of 2037 ± 27 Ma for this process. We relate the Paleoproterozoic hydration to form amphibole in gabbronorite to the residual aqueous fluids expelled during crystallization of an anatectic melt in the spatially associated amphibolite. The results highlight an example of the formation of amphibole in Archean layered mafic rocks via a post-magmatic hydration event.",en

In situ monazite U‐Pb geochronology and Rare Earth Elements (REE) geochemistry were performed in the Erzgebirge Crystalline Complex on phyllites and micaschists surrounding the ultra‐high‐pressure (UHP) core of the Erzgebirge dome. The resulting ages and REE patterns were linked to the individual tectonometamorphic events and revealed that the hanging‐wall phyllites experienced prograde metamorphism around ∼350 Ma, followed by exhumation at ∼345–340 Ma. The oldest age (∼339 Ma) recorded in garnet cores in the foot‐wall micaschists is considered as an upper age limit for their prograde metamorphism, while matrix monazite ages of ∼330 Ma reflect a significant resetting of the monazite age system. Spatial distribution of metamorphic isograds and ages indicates a phase of accretion of continental material resulting in an inverted metamorphic field gradient in the wedge between ∼360 and ∼340 Ma. This phase was followed by exhumation of a significant portion of buoyant subducted continental material leading to massive ductile thinning of the wedge around ∼335 Ma. Finally, a late Variscan intracontinental deformation was responsible for heterogeneous reactivation and final exhumation of the wedge at ∼330 Ma. It is newly shown that the Saxothuringian wedge can be divided into a younger inner part, formed by micaschists and UHP rocks, and an older outer part, formed by phyllites.",en

The major petrographic types documented here include wackestone, packstone, and grainstone which fall into the type I and II categories of the triangular classification scheme indicating formation in a short-lived, high-energy environment that was dissipating at the time of deposition. The samples have a distinct signature that includes extensive diagenesis with varying intensities of compaction, recrystallization, pressure solution, and neomorphism. In occurrences of stratigraphically significant foraminiferal assemblages and palynofossils, the Garampani Limestone is assigned Middle Eocene age. Most of the samples produced positive δ13C ‰ ranging from 1.64 to 0.76 ‰ (PDB) and correlated with a transgressive phase. The negative δ18O values range from −6.25 to −4.67 ‰ (PDB) suggesting that the Middle Eocene was generally characterized by a warmer climate.",en

This is especially the case for the Tarim Basin, western China where regional and global correlations of the Middle-Upper Cambrian boundary are hampered by incomplete biostratigraphy. The Middle-Upper Cambrian boundary (T81) in the Tarim Basin is characterized by an abrupt switch of lithological and sedimentary facies, a sudden change of wireline log responses, and the contrasting seismic features, structural styles and carbonate platform architectures. The T81 boundary manifests in various forms and styles including syn-sedimentary unconformity, overlapping unconformity, tectonic unconformity, multi-stage superimposed unconformity, parallel unconformity and conformity. Each manifestation type of the T81 boundary was influenced by at least one of the factors including paleo-geomorphology, tectonic movement, eustacy, and climatic change. Based on the correlation between carbon isotopes and sedimentary characteristics in different regions globally, we suggest that the δ13C weak negative shift that follows the strongly positive shift of the Late Cambrian SPICE event can serve as a reliable isotope stratigraphic marker for identifying the T81 boundary of the western Tarim Platform. The top of the Awatag Formation (the top of the Middle Cambrian) in the western Tarim Platform should thus be correlated to the top of the Mohershan Formation in the eastern Tarim Basin, corresponding to the top of the Miaolingian Stage. The absence of the SPICE event in the western part of the Tarim Basin may have been caused by a regional depositional hiatus associated with the T81 boundary.",en

The Falkland/Malvinas Islands have been considered either an autochthonous part of the South American continent or part of an independent microplate displaced from the southeastern corner of Africa. We report detrital zircon U-Pb results (n = 1306 LA-ICPMS ages) for 11 sandstone samples from the Silurian-Devonian West Falkland Group (N = 7 samples, n = 837 grains) and Carboniferous-Permian Lafonia Group (N = 4 samples, n = 469 grains). Detrital zircon age distributions for the West Falkland Group point to consistent contributions from Neoproterozoic-Cambrian (650–520 Ma) and Mesoproterozoic (1100–1000 Ma) sources. Heavy mineral assemblages and sandstone petrographic data from these samples indicate significant input from recycled sediments. A potential shift in sediment sources during deposition of the Lafonia Group is indicated by the appearance of late Paleozoic (350–250 Ma) and Proterozoic (2000–1200 Ma) age populations, decreased proportions of stable heavy minerals, and a shift to juvenile Hf values for < 300 Ma zircons. The provenance change can be attributed to the onset of subduction-related arc magmatism and potential regional shortening and crustal thickening in southwestern Gondwana during the Permian transition of a passive margin into an active, retro-arc foreland basin. The detrital zircon age distributions identified here reflect potential source regions in southern Africa and/or the Transantarctic Mountains in Antarctica. These results are most readily accommodated within a Gondwana reconstruction that includes the Falkland/Malvinas Islands as a rotated microplate originating on the eastern side of southern Africa as part of the Gondwanide fold-thrust belt spanning from the Ventania region of Argentina through the Cape region of South Africa and into the Ellsworth and Pensacola mountains of Antarctica.",en
https://openalex.org/W4380758670,2023,Geology,"Lithospheric dripping triggered by slab break-off: A possible mechanism for Late Carboniferous magmatism in the eastern Central Asian Orogenic BeltIn this paper, we present zircon UPb dating, elemental geochemistry, and Sr–Nd–Hf isotopic compositions for Late Carboniferous intrusive rocks in the northern Great Xing'an Range, northeast China. We decipher the mechanisms which triggered lithospheric thinning under microblock-microblock collision and provide a new perspective on the Late Paleozoic evolution of the eastern Central Asian Orogenic Belt. Zircon UPb dating indicates that Jifeng gabbroic diorites and Xinlin granites were formed during a short time interval at 322–321 Ma, whereas the Xinlin gabbros were crystallized at 300 ± 2 Ma. The Jifeng gabbroic diorites exhibit typical arc characteristics, depleted in HFSEs and enriched in Pb and have positive εNd(t) (+1.88 to +2.00) and εHf(t) (+6.6 to +10.7) values, suggesting they originated from the partial melting of depleted lithospheric mantle modified by slab fluids. The Xinlin gabbros belong to alkaline series and are characterized by the enrichment in HFSEs with positive Nb and Ta anomalies and depleted NdHf isotopic compositions (zircon εHf(t) = +12.5 to +18.9, whole rock εNd(t) = +8.0 to +8.1). High Nb concentrations and low La/Nb (0.81–0.83) and La/Ta (12.50–14.61) ratios of the Xinlin gabbros indicate an origin from a depleted asthenospheric mantle. Xinlin granites have high-K calc-alkaline compositions, belonging to I-type granites. These granites have positive εHf(t) values (+0.2 to +15.1) and juvenile two-stage model ages (1314–506 Ma) with low Sr and high Yb contents, indicating they were formed by the partial melting of a juvenile lower crust under low-pressure conditions. These data, together with the temporal and spatial distribution and the geochemistry characteristics of the Carboniferous igneous rocks in the Great Xing'an Range, suggest that the amalgamation between the Erguna–Xing'an and Songnen blocks occurred before the Late Carboniferous. The occurrence of asthenospheric mantle-derived mafic rocks indicates localized thinning process of lithosphere. Late Carboniferous magmatism on the Erguna–Xing'an Block attributed to dripping or piece removal of the lithosphere due to asthenospheric fluctuation triggered by slab break-off.",en

In the western TNC, late Cambrian to early Ordovician oceanic arc formation, followed by arc&amp;#8211;continent collision and ophiolite obduction onto a Laurentia-derived microcontinent, is well-documented. Following arc&amp;#8211;continent collision, a mid-Ordovician phase of rifting has recently been identified, which produced a peculiar volcanic association of MORB-type basalts and a variety of alkaline, shoshonitic and ultrapotassic volcanic rocks. In the eastern TNC, the volcanic and tectonic evolution is less well constrained, but the Fundsj&amp;#248; Group is traditionally interpreted to represent an immature, ensimatic island arc of late Cambrian age. &amp;#160;Recent field mapping, geochemistry, and air-borne geophysical work in the eastern TNC has identified a distinctive volcanic complex in the Gr&amp;#248;nfjellet area, previously mapped as part of the Fundsj&amp;#248; Group. The complex covers at least 7 km2 and comprises a variety of rock types: (1) pyroclastic volcanic deposits with up to 20x10 cm large, subrounded, flattened, fine-grained clasts with feldspar and amphibole crystals in a matrix of similar composition, (2) fine-grained greyish rocks with mm-sized white feldspar aggregates/crystals and/or mm- to cm-sized amphibole crystals, with and without subtle compositional layering, (3) homogeneous, fine- to medium-grained feldspar- and amphibole-rich rock (&amp;#8220;micro-gabbro texture&amp;#8221;), and (4) very fine-grained, flinty, light-grey-greenish rocks with a homogeneous texture. Along its northern and eastern borders, the complex is associated with abundant marble layers; the western border is associated with brownish-weathering biotite-muscovite schists, whereas the southern continuation of the complex is still unclear.Preliminary geochemical data from ten fine-grained samples of volcanic origin reveal a peculiar composition: they plot as alkaline rocks in the Nb/Y vs. Zr/Ti diagram; they are enriched in LREE as well as Th, U, Nb and Ta; they plot close to the MORB&amp;#8211;OIB array in the Nb/Yb vs Th/Yb diagram; and they do not show significant negative Nb-Ta anomalies typical for island-arc or back-arc settings. Ranging in composition from trachybasalt, through basaltic trachyandesite to trachyandesite, they are very different from the typical island arc tholeiites and back-arc basin basalts of the Fundsj&amp;#248; Group metavolcanic rocks elsewhere, and are more similar to rift-related alkaline rocks from the western TNC.

It is related to a ~ 9 Ma granodiorite porphyry intrusion, with three main stages of hydrothermal activity. The homogenization temperatures for the fluid inclusions are in the ranges of 200–494 °C, and their salinities vary from 4.0 to 42.8 wt% NaCl equiv., which are typical magmatic-hydrothermal fluids. The δ34S values of sulfides range from −0.4 to +3.2 ‰ (V-CDT), and the δ34S values of anhydrite samples range from +11.6 to +16.8 ‰. The δ34S values of sulfides show a narrow range, implying a homogeneous sulfur source. The oxygen isotopic composition of hydrothermal water in equilibrium with quartz samples ranges from +3.4 to +6.0 ‰ (V-SMOW) consistent with the hydrothermal fluids having a magmatic signature, but diluted with meteoric waters in the main mineralizing stage. The most important factors responsible for metal precipitation in the Iju porphyry deposit are fluid boiling, oxygen fugacity decrease and cooling followed by dilution with meteoric water. The primary fluids of the Iju Cu deposit are characterized by relatively high temperature and moderate salinity, and are CO2-rich, indicating a typical post-collisional porphyry system.",en

There are small subvolcanic dykes that intrude Paleocene granitoids on the Barchans, Forge, Booth and Dannebrog Islands. The authors studied the occurrence, petrography and geochemistry of the dyke rocks in order to find out the peculiarities of their formation. The studied dykes are typical post-plutonic fissure intrusions injected in the host granitoids after their complete consolidation and cooling. Moreover, the host granitoids were not only cooled before the dyking but they were also exhumed at the beginning of the Neogene due to of the processes of tectonic uplift and erosion. Field observation and some other features point out to the Late Neogene or Quaternary age of the dykes. Their intrusion occurred at the shallow depths. During formation, at least part of the dykes was connected with the earth’s surface. So, they were conduits for fissured volcanic eruptions. The geochemical features of the most widespread basaltic dykes call into question their genetic connection with quantitatively subordinate dykes of andesitic and dacitic composition. They probably had different sources of magma generation that were related to different geotectonic processes. Andesitic and dacitic dykes may represent the final outburst of subduction-related calc-alkaline magmatism. On the other hand, the connection between subduction processes and Late Cenozoic basaltic dyking is not obvious and requires additional research.",en

The mechanisms for the originations of the Archean continents and SCLM remain unclear. This study suggests that these events were controlled by a deep-water cycle (DWC) in the early Earth. With the solidification of the basal magma ocean (BMO), water in the BMO moved toward the core-mantle boundary and the BMO eventually became gravity unstable because of the enrichment of water. The gravity instability triggered the massive mantle overturns and transported a huge amount of water upward to the shallow part of the Earth. The massive overturn events resulted in the major pulses of the thick SCLM and continental crust generations in the Neoarchean. The DWC model in the early Earth can account for the episodic feature of continental growth and why TTG and thick SCLM basically occurred in the Archean. The DWC model also shows why only the Earth among inner solar system planets was covered with the continental crust. Our results suggest that the DWC played a first-order role in the evolution and dynamics of the early Earth just like the current DWC driven by the plate tectonics on the nowadays Earth.",en

The adjacent ice streams speed-up due to the decrease in back-pressure from the weakened ice shelves. Most methods typically used to quantify the buttressing of ice shelves analyze the state at individual locations along the grounding line or within the shelf. Based on the stress-balance at the grounding line, we here present a method to quantify shelf-wide buttressing values in Antarctica. The Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) and &amp;#218;a are used in diagnostic as well as in transient experiments to compare the buttressing effect of major ice shelves in Antarctica. We show an increase in buttressing in more confined ice shelves and a decrease for higher basal melt rates.

The newly-developed, shelf-wide buttressing metrics can be used to understand the role of ice shelves in changing climate conditions.",en
https://openalex.org/W4319763395,2023,Geology,"High-frequency depositional sequence of the upper Quaternary deposits controlled by sediment supply: A case study of an inland basin in central JapanDepositional sequences in inland basins are regulated by environmental changes, such as climate change, sediment supply, water input/output, and tectonics. Their mechanisms and driving factors are diverse in each geological setting. This study provides a short-term (millennial to ten thousand years timescales) overview of the sedimentologic evolution in an inland basin located at a high altitude and characterized by fast sedimentation rates (Suwa Basin, central Japan). We employed a multi-disciplinary approach combining sedimentology, paleopedology, and high-resolution sequence stratigraphic analysis of the upper Pleistocene and Holocene succession to clarify the driving factors of the basin's sedimentologic evolution. The depositional systems and systems tracts were divided into meandering fluvial (lowstand systems tract; 26.7–16.5 cal kyr BP), pond/marsh (early transgressive systems tract; 16.5–13.9 cal kyr BP), lacustrine (transgressive systems tract; 13.9–5.8 cal kyr BP), and delta systems (highstand systems tract; 5.8 cal kyr BP–). The boundary between the meandering fluvial and pond/marsh systems corresponds to a transgressive surface appearing as a rising in the lake level (ca. 16.5 cal kyr BP). The boundary between the lacustrine and delta systems corresponds to a maximum flooding surface of the lake (ca. 5.8 cal kyr BP). The lake transgression occurs simultaneously with a decrease in the sediment supply, as suggested by a decrease in the sedimentation rate, the dense development of paleosols, and high TOC and TN showing a lower decomposition rate. The timing coincides with the intensification of chemical weathering, plant succession, and the ascending alpine tree line in the source region during the Northern Hemisphere deglaciation. The depositional sequence in the interior basin might have been easily controlled by changes in the sediment supply due to vegetation/soil cover successions during the glacial-interglacial cycle. Our findings imply that low-frequency depositional sequences observed in such inland basins in the East Asian coastal region may have also been forced by global ice volume changes.",en

The oil and gas-bearing province of Eastern Ukraine is located in the Dnipro-Donetsk Basin (DDB). It covers the Paleozoic structural floor and is buried under younger sediments. The Paleozoic structural floor of the territory is represented as a long rift graben. The maximum thickness of the sedimentary cover in the graben is 15–17 km. According to geophysical data, the thickness of the earth's crust is 31–32 km under the axial part of the DDB and increases towards the sides. But according to the maximum thickness and facies characteristics of the Paleozoic deposits, the thickness of the Earth's crust below them could not exceed 20 km. The modern thickness is 1.5 times higher. Therefore, such a geological-geophysical model of the structure of the DDB is contradictory. Analysis of recent research and publications. The removal of the contradiction is possible due to the detection of a series of Hercynian thrusts with total amplitude of thrusts of the order of 50 km. Such thrusts began to be established on the northern and southern flanks of the DDB. Hercynian thrusts have a southwestern vergence. In the north, the Voronezh crystalline massif is pushed onto the DDB along the Noviy thrust with an amplitude of 9–10 km. In the south, the South Donbas melange zone is established, which pushes the folded Donbas onto the Ukrainian shield. On its continuation to the northwest is the southern side of the DDB - the so-called Southern monocline. The well-studied Pavlograd-Petropavlovsk coal mining district of Western Donbass with operating coal mines is located within its borders. An unsolved part of the overall problem. Numerous faults with relatively small amplitudes are established within the Paleozoic Southern Monocline. Together, they form a system of horsts and grabens with a north-western extension. But the bottom parts of the grabens are 1–3 km higher than the tops of the horsts. Such a geological situation is anomalous. This indicates the post-fault dislocation of the horst-graben system as a whole. The purpose of the article is identification of the causes of the anomalous structural position of the graben-horst system in the modern geological structure of the Southern Monocline and in the general model of the geological structure of Eastern Ukraine. Research materials and methods. Were involved more than 390 geological sections, constructed based on the data of more than 10,000 wells. Of them, 265 wells revealed the folds that are being analyzed. In addition, were used data of catagenetic transformations of the sedimentary section. Presentation of the main research material. The South Donbas mélange zone falls to the northeast and continues under the Southern Monocline. It is located in the upper block of this regional thrust structure and is in an allochthonous setting. According to geological data, the true amplitude of the thrust of Western Donbas on the Ukrainian shield is 15–20 km, and the vertical component of this amplitude exceeds 3 km. Such spatial parameters explain the abnormality of the structural position of the horsts and grabens of Western Donbass - their southwestern flanks were significantly raised relative to the northeastern flanks during thrusting. Scientific novelty. Therefore, in the modern geological structure, the Dnipro-Donetsk ""basin"" is not a rift, but a post-rift Hercynian folded region. It is formed by high-amplitude thrusts on the northern and southern flanks. The Hercynian fold region is buried under Mesozoic and Cenozoic sediments and is further complicated by Laramian and Attic fold-thrust dislocations of lesser intensity. Conclusions. The thrust model brings the geophysical parameters into the correspondence with the geological data and is confirmed by the actual material.",en

However, in many cases precise identification and correlation of this crucial boundary in lithologically contrasting sections is complicated, even if the whole spectrum of biostratigraphic and chemostratigraphic methods is applied. The Precambrian–Cambrian transitional strata of the Igarka Uplift (Sukharikha Formation) perfectly illustrate this problem. This unit has arguably one of the most detailed carbonate carbon isotope curves for this time interval (at least within the Siberian Platform). However, an extremely poor paleontological record previously reported from the Sukharikha Formation makes identification of major stratigraphic boundaries highly debatable. We present a detailed study of the Sukharikha and overlying Krasnyi Porog formations in three sections (Sukharikha River, Kulyumbe River, and Khantaisko-Sukhotungusskaya-1 well). Our chemostratigraphic and biostratigraphic data provide a correlation basis for these sections and identify the Cambrian boundary in terms of both the International Chronostratigraphic Chart and General Stratigraphic Scale of Russia. We show that lithologic boundaries and levels of the local first appearance of Tommotian small skeletal fossils are diachronous within the Igarka paleobasin. The latter is putatively caused by paleoecology of the early Cambrian biota and by taphonomic factors.

However, the types and origins of quartz in deeply-buried Upper Permian mudstones, a potential target of shale gas exploration in South China, remain poorly understood. A suite of deeply buried (5636–5645 m) mudstone samples of the Upper Permian Dalong Formation (DL) in the Sichuan Basin (South China) was selected to characterize quartz minerals using petrological and geochemical approaches, including SEM-CL observation. The studied mudstone samples are relatively enriched in organic matter (OM) (total organic carbon (TOC) = 1.88–18.46 wt%) and have been thermally over-matured. The DL organic mudstones accumulated in a failed rift basin, far removed from provenance areas, are chiefly composed of intrabasinal quartz and carbonate (mostly calcite). Quartz is represented by six major forms, including detrital quartz grains, siliceous skeletal fragments, silica nanospheres, microquartz aggregates, grain-replacive quartz, and matrix-dispersed microquartz, of which the latter five are of authigenic origin. Detrital quartz grains are not common in the DL mudstones. Silica reprecipitated as authigenic quartz was largely sourced from dissolved siliceous skeletal fragments (mostly radiolarians), and some silica appeared to have been released from the alteration of volcanic debris (mainly plagioclase) to form matrix-dispersed microquartz grains. Authigenic quartz influenced pore development and preservation of shale reservoirs in two ways. A rigid framework formed from numerous authigenic quartz grains (e.g., microquartz aggregates, silica nanospheres, and siliceous skeletal fragments) shields organic pores during mechanical compaction, whereas authigenic quartz precipitation (e.g., cavity-filling quartz, grain-replacive quartz) reduces porosity by filling voids. A moderate abundance of authigenic quartz (Sixs = ∼20%) is most favorable for development and preservation of pores (especially organic pores) in deep mudstone. Organic pores, widely developed in the studied DL deep mudstones, seem to be largely preserved in the samples with TOC values as much as 18.46 wt%. In summary, the DL mudstone deposits enriched in OM and contained moderate contents of authigenic quartz are especially favorable targets of deep shale gas exploration.",en

Subsequent research has focused on the processes responsible for PKT concentration and localization (e.g., degree-1 convection, farside impact basin effects, etc.), and the effect of PKT high-radioactivity localization on lunar thermal evolution (e.g., topography relaxation, mantle heating, late-stage mare basalt generation, etc.). Here we use a stratigraphic approach and new crustal thickness data to probe the nature of the PKT with depth. We find that most PKT characteristics can be explained by sequential impact cratering events that excavated and redistributed to the surface/near-surface a much thinner Th-rich KREEP layer at depth, implying that no anomalous conditions of PKT thickness, radioactive abundances, geodynamics, thermal effects or magma generation are likely to be required as in the previous studies.",en

The Mozahem stratovolcano, which has been caused by the subduction of the oceanic crust of Neotethys under Central Iran, is one of the Neogene volcanoes located in the southeast of the Urumieh-Dokhtar magmatic arc. The magmatic nature of the rocks forming the volcano is potassium-rich calc-alkaline. In this research, we used petrology, satellite images, and aeromagnetic data to understand the relationship between tectonics and magmatism. Mozahem stratovolcano area is limited to the NW-SE-trending Rafsanjan and Shahr-e-Babak fault zones and cut by the N–S-trending Anar fault. During the Neogene, the activity of the dextral Anar fault, especially in its southern termination areas, has caused changes in the local stress field and created deformations in different parts of this region. The displacement of blocks on both sides of the Anar fault has led to the development of compressive structures (folds and thrusts) at the eastern and tensile structures (dikes and subvolcanic masses) at its western half. The location of minor faults in the southern tip of the Anar fault and different mechanisms on both the eastern and western sides of the fault are comparable with the model of synthetic and antithetic splay faults at the tip.

The study evaluates the potential volcanic disasters at the proposed site of the Ujung Lemah Abang nuclear power plant (NPP-ULA) near Mount Muria using the Bayesian method, which is based on a probabilistic model of the spatial distribution of volcanic events in the past and the geological processes model. Mount Mulia is a polygenetic volcano that undergoes periodic eruptions alternating between lateral and central eruption-dominated phases. Semivariogram analysis shows a range of 150,000 years. This corresponds to the average duration of volcanic activity and the time between eruptions. Mount Muria volcanic complex can be classified as an extinct volcano with limited future eruption potential based on its last activity 320,000 years ago. The probability of eruption occurrences in Muria within the next 100 years is 1.21856 x 10 −5 . With this probability of eruptions, it appears that the Muria Mtn is not going to be erupted anytime soon. However, when a new magma system emerges, resulting in epicenter concentrations beneath Mount Muria, micro-earthquake monitoring is required to detect magmatic activities beneath the Muria Volcanic Complex. To estimate the likelihood of phreatomagmatic eruptions, geothermometer monitoring in deep wells is required as an active monitoring of hydrothermal activity in the Muria Volcanic Complex.",en

This study investigates the Cheka block (pluton) of alkaline granitoids (Southern Urals, Chelyabinsk Oblast). The objective of this study was to further investigate its existing deformation model after previous studies though the methods of fracture analysis, petromagnetic studies and geochemical analysis.The Cheka pluton is composed of the Cheka Mountain and has a meridional strike and dimensions of 6.5 km long and 1-2 km wide. The pluton is composed of alkaline rocks of three intrusion phases: first &amp;#8211; monzodiorites, second &amp;#8211; alkaline syenites, third &amp;#8211; alkaline granites and granosyenites. The pluton is Triassic and intrudes Carboniferous volcanics. The western contact of the Cheka pluton is limited by a dextral fault. The pluton is situated in the Magnitogorsk zone.During the formation of the pluton, extension changed to compression. This led to formation of a right-lateral transpression setting with a system of meridional strike-slip and near-slip extension zones. These changes were followed by low-grade metamorphism.This study can be split into two sections: structural analysis and geochemical/isotopes description. The first part was partially conducted previously and presented in 2022.Materials and methods. To reconstruct structural evolution of the pluton a combination of petromagnetic studies, magnetic mineralogy and fracture analysis were used as well as supporting aerial and satellite imagery. 62 core samples and over 180 fracture measurements from 7 locations were used for each method respectively. Petromagnetic data was collected by drilling procedures, processed using MFK-1 kappabridge at room temperature and after heating to 470 &amp;#176;C and analyzed in Anisoft 5.1.08 software. Magnetic mineralogy lab analyses were performed with interpretation using Max UnMix software. Fracture analysis was conducted in Stereonet v.11.3.0.As the second part of the study geochemical analyses were conducted &amp;#8211; silicate geochemistry and ICP-MS at 6 locations.Results and discussion. Petromagetic studies showed the magma flow to have an orientation of 036&amp;#176;. Analysis of tectonic fractures points to the Riedel fracture model with main fracture zone orientation (compression) of 039&amp;#176;. Since the magma flow and compression orientation match a deformation model can be constructed. Also based on the magma flow orientation, types of protectonic fractures were identified (S, Q, L).Geochemical analyses showed that the elemental signature of the pluton matches the upper crust the best and shows signs of subduction. Silicate geochemistry shows a clear trend in Na2O concentration, while K2O concentrations do not. This pattern is interpreted as a sign of low-grade metamorphism (prehnite-pumpellyite facies).A full deformation model was created based on two methods with additional supporting data providing strong evidence for the Riedel based deformation model, which corresponds to previous structural and geochemical findings. The model suggests that the Cheka pluton was formed in a general right-lateral transpression setting with following tectonic developments and related low-grade metamorphism.Financial support.

Bathymetric data in shallow sea areas can currently be obtained using SDB (satellite-derived bathymetry) with multispectral satellites based on depth inversion models. In situ bathymetric data are crucial for validating empirical models but are currently limited in remote and unapproachable areas. In this paper, instead of using the measured water depth data, ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2) ATL03 bathymetric points at different acquisition dates and multispectral imagery from Sentinel-2/GeoEye-1 were used to train and evaluate water depth inversion empirical models in two study regions: Shanhu Island in the South China Sea, and Heron Island in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) in Australia. However, different sediment types also influenced the SDB results. Therefore, three types of sediments (sand, reef, and coral/algae) were analyzed for Heron Island, and four types of sediments (sand, reef, rubble and coral/algae) were analyzed for Shanhu Island. The results show that accuracy generally improved when sediment classification information was considered in both study areas. For Heron Island, the sand sediments showed the best performance in both models compared to the other sediments, with mean R2 and RMSE values of 0.90 and 1.52 m, respectively, representing a 5.6% improvement of the latter metric. For Shanhu Island, the rubble sediments showed the best accuracy in both models, and the average R2 and RMSE values were 0.97 and 0.65 m, respectively, indicating an RMSE improvement of 15.5%.

https://openalex.org/W4321485462,2023,Geology,"Chemical vectoring in continental geothermal systems: Composition of altered rocks and illite as guides to magmatic degassingThe Taupō Volcanic Zone, New Zealand, is one of the most voluminous volcanic regions on Earth. Over the last 1.8 Myr, bimodal volcanism in this rifted-arc setting has been dominated by voluminous rhyolite ignimbrite eruptions (>6000 km3 cumulative) and minor arc-type andesite and dacite, underpinned by basaltic intrusions. The combination of the magmatism and extensionally thinned arc crust with high heat flow has resulted in more than 23 active geothermal fields in the region. The fluids sampled in the geothermal systems are dominated by dilute meteoric fluids that are low in components such as acids, alkalis, and some trace metals commonly ascribed to magmatic sources but can contain large amounts of deep sourced magmatic volatiles such as CO2. This study was designed to assess the long-term (>20,000yr) fluid and metal input into two Taupō geothermal systems, and the amount and proportion of magmatic-derived components in these fluids. We collected major and trace element compositions of hydrothermal altered whole rocks and clay minerals from two active geothermal systems and compared them with hydrothermally altered rocks of the fossil (0.6 Ma) Ngatamariki magmatic-hydrothermal system, which has a demonstrated large magmatic contribution. The Ohaaki and Rotokawa geothermal systems have both been drilled to a depth of 3000 m, with sampled reservoir fluids containing low concentrations of chloride (∼1000 mg/kg) but high levels of gas (CO2, N2) that have previously been interpreted to reflect subduction components derived from arc-type magmas. Whole-rock samples lack enrichment in chloride-transported metals such as Cu, Pb or Zn but have minor anomalies of bisulfide-complexed Au, Sb, and As in the uppermost 1500 m of the geothermal reservoirs. Hydrothermal water-rock interactions in the deep reservoirs of both geothermal systems at temperatures between 220 and 300 °C produced assemblages of illite + albite + adularia + calcite + pyrite that are in equilibrium with the observed neutral to slightly acidic pH (6 ± 1) of the present-day fluids. In the lower temperature end of this range, Mg and Fe increasingly enter the illite crystal lattice via Tschermak-type (phengite) substitution, whereas a few high-temperature (>300 °C) samples contain scarce muscovite compositions. The illites commonly have low contents of most trace metals, although minor amounts of Cs, Li, Cu, Sb and Sn occur in near-surface samples. Based on these data, over the >20,000-year lifetime of the Ohaaki and Rotokawa geothermal systems, fluids were dominated by chloride-poor meteoric water and contained little magmatic contributions other than conducted heat, some gases (CO2 - N2 ± H2S), and a small fraction of the total H2O of geothermal waters. Therefore, the inferred magma bodies of intermediate to silicic composition that lie at shallow depth beneath these geothermal systems currently are not, and likely have not been for >20,000 years, degassing significant water and chloride despite the high water and chloride contents of the magmas. By inference, the intermediate to silicic magmas at depth have not transferred large amounts of volatiles to the geothermal systems over this period, and rather are storing them in the magmatic bodies to be released in volcanic eruptions that are commonly explosive and pyroclastic in nature and highly hazardous.",en
https://openalex.org/W4366245288,2023,Geology,"Review of tectonic inversion of sedimentary basins in NE and N Brazil: Analysis of mechanisms, timing and effects on structures and reliefMost intraplate areas worldwide are under compression characterized by thrust and strike-slip deformations. The sources of the stresses in these regions are a combination of far-field (regional) stresses (e.g., ridge push, slab pull, lithospheric drag) and near-field (local) stresses (e.g., topography, lateral and vertical anisotropy of strength or elastic properties, erosion, flexural bending, overloading, buoyancy of low-density regions). These intraplate regions are sites favorable for the tectonic inversion of sedimentary basins. Here, we review the tectonic inversions of the sedimentary basins in NE and N Brazil, which comprise a significant part of the South American intraplate (the South American Platform). These regions have been under compression since the Late Cretaceous. Reports of post-rift basin inversions derived from seismic profiles, fault-slip data, and topography have been described in the Sergipe-Alagoas, Paraíba, Potiguar, Ceará, Rio do Peixe, Araripe (NE Brazil), and Solimões (N Brazil) basins. Reports of inversions in the rift phase have also been described in the Araripe Basin. The present-day stress field indicates that inversions in NE Brazil can mainly be characterized as strike-slip and thrust fault regimes, whereas in N Brazil, inversions have occurred under reverse stress regimes. The most frequent inversion structures are reactivated faults, folds, and dome structures affecting the topography and the consequent uplift of rift and post-rift sedimentary units. Inversions have led to the reactivation of continental-scale structures, such as the strike-slip dextral shearing of the Transbrasiliano lineament, which affected rift and post-rift units in the Equatorial Margin of Brazil. The small crustal thickness of these areas favors inversion, as indicated by the most recent Moho depth map of South America. The interplay between far-field and near-field stresses explains the stress pattern in NE and N Brazil, where inversions have been observed.",en

The Shaerbuti volcanic rocks consist of calc-alkali basalt and andesite formed in an arc setting. The porphyroclastic texture of basalt, explosive breccia rock, and the distribution of both breccia and agglomerate provide robust evidence that a volcanic edifice exists in Shaerbuti Mountain. Based on geochemical features, the Shaerbuti volcanic rocks have been identified as being of two types. Type I volcanic rocks have light rare earth element (LREE)-enriched patterns, with La/Sm ratios of 2.27–4.03, Th/Yb ratios of 0.50–1.46, and Nb/Yb ratios of 1.11–2.28. Type II volcanic rocks display a flat rare earth element (REE) pattern, with La/Sm ratios ranging from 1.83 to 2.43, Th/Yb ratios ranging from 0.24 to 0.45, and Nb/Yb ratios ranging from 0.87 to 0.93. In the studied rocks, MgO-Cr, MgO-Ni and MgO-CaO present a positive relationship, which indicates clinopyroxenes crystallized. The Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions of these basalts present values of 0.7045 to 0.7063 ((87Sr/86Sr)i), 6.4 to 6.6 (εNd(t)), and 17.1300 to 18.3477 ((206Pb/204Pb)i), respectively. According to Sr-Nd-Pb isotope features, we argue that melts of altered oceanic crust and sediments were incorporated into the source. We also evaluate the water content (0.55%–6.72%) of the studied volcanic rocks.",en

In this study, we introduce an Occam-type inversion algorithm into a spherical coordinate system, and invert the magnetization based on the three-component magnetic anomalies. The synthetic model tests show that the inversion effects of the vertical components are relatively stable, while the anti-noise ability is strong. We apply the algorithm to a set of vertical component anomalies derived from the satellite magnetic field model and obtain Dabie orogen 3D magnetization distribution. Multiple magnetic sources are identified within the orogen and adjacent areas, and the related tectonic evolution processes are analyzed. The significant magnetization characteristics of the orogen can be associated with mantle upwelling caused by the Early Cretaceous lithospheric delamination, along with the partial melting of the mafic–ultramafic lower crust that had not participated in the delamination. The magnetic sources near the Mozitan–Xiaotian fault, and those located in the western Dabie area, are also restricted by Mesozoic and Jurassic–Cretaceous deep melt activities, respectively. The study provides evidence for the suture line position of the plate subduction in the deep lithosphere. Furthermore, the results display certain indications of mineralization activities in the middle–lower Yangtze Valley metallogenic belt.",en
https://openalex.org/W4311086953,2023,Geology,"Tectono-sedimentary evolution of the Paleogene Qikou Sag, Bohai Bay Basin, NE ChinaThe Qikou Sag is a petroliferous tectonic unit within the Bohai Bay Basin, northeast China. The depositional system evolved temporally, spatially, and episodically in five rifting stages (stages 1–5) during the Paleogene and Neogene, with sedimentation responding to regional subsidence. This study focuses on the tectono-sedimentary evolution through stages 2–4, while the main oil-bearing sedimentary rocks were deposited in the Bohai Bay Basin. The depositional system exhibited retrogradation and then progradation during the rifting stage 2 (43–36.7 Ma), retrogradation in stage 3 (36.7–32.8 Ma), and upward coarsening and progradation in stage 4 (32.8–24.6 Ma). This vertical superposition corresponded to three episodic stages of rising and falling lake levels during the Paleogene, which were equivalent to a transgressive with regressive (stage 2), transgressive (stage 3), and then regressive (stage 4) cycle. The sediment fills coincided with the tectonism and the regional subsidence history of the Qikou Sag, which is composed of uplift areas and sub-sags. In this respect, the boundary fault activity around the sub-sags decreased from stages 2–4, leading to the migration of sub-sag depocenters from near faults to the center of sub-sags, which suggests that faults released control over the sedimentation. Secondly, tectonism and the total subsidence rate decreased from SQ1 to SQ7 (stages 2–3) and then accelerated at the end of stage 4 (SQ10 to SQ11). The tectonic subsidence rates decreased quicker than the total subsidence rate; this demonstrates that major rift faulting was the dominant geological process in the early Paleogene, whereas overall subsidence was dominant in the late Paleogene.",en

Marble, found in various colors and textures, has been used as a building stone for centuries, either as cut stone or polished stone. The present study evaluated the petrological, geochemical, and geotechnical characterizations of the Gahirat Marble formation as a building stone. It is exposed over an area of 160 square kilometers in southwestern Chitral. The Gahirat Marble formation has been divided into two parts, i.e., the eastern and western parts. The eastern part is a coarse crystalline rock that exhibits a granulose structure and was subjected to amphibolite facies metamorphism, whereas its western part is a coarse-to-medium crystalline rock that displays a differential granulose structure and was subjected to green schist facies metamorphism. Petrographically, it is composed mainly of calcite (&gt;92%) with minute quartz, chlorite, muscovite, biotite, garnet, and opaque minerals. The X-ray fluorescence (XRF) technique was used to analyze the chemical composition of the Gahirat Marble showing that it is a pure calciocarbonate marble (CaO: 53.16–55.02 wt.%). The specific gravity measured varies from 2.46–2.71 gm/cm3, water absorption is &lt;0.2%, sulfate soundness is &lt;0.65, and due to its unconfined compressive strength, it is classified as strong rock, thus conforming to ASTM C503 specifications.

Detrital minerals such as zircon, garnet, and apatite are useful media for studies of sedimentary sources and basin evolution. Detrital zircon has been widely taken as an indicator for provenances and tectonic evolution of geological terrenes via age distribution patterns. Apatite can remain stable during erosion and transportation and is also considered as an ideal object for source tracing. This mineral normally contains high Sr and negligible Rb. Its Sr isotopic composition can remain almost unchanged after crystallization. Unlike isotopic ages of detrital minerals, Apatite isotopic compositions have been less frequently used for tracing the provenance of sedimentary rocks in the last few decades. In the present study, we report on the Sr isotopic composition of individual apatite grains of Neogene and Jurassic conglomerates from the Hui-Cheng basin in the South Qinling orogenic belt, obtained via thermal ionization mass spectrometry. Detrital apatite grains of Jurassic rocks have narrow ranges of 87Sr/86Sr values from 0.7076 to 0.7100, but those of Neogene rocks gave variant 87Sr/86Sr values from 0.7055 to 0.7534, providing distinct evidence for complex sources of Neogene sedimentary rocks. Analytical results show that the distribution patterns of 87Sr/86Sr values of single-grain detrital apatite fit the distribution patterns of detrital zircon U-Pb from the isotopic ages very well. Detrital apatite Sr isotopic composition can provide essential information for tracing the origins and evolution of sedimentary sources.",en

The Cretaceous period marks the age of Basin formation from which the Mamfe Basin was formed from the Albian to Cenomanian. The purpose of this study is to investigate the geochemical behaviour of the shales in the Mamfe Basin and their paleoclimatic and metallogenic significance. Twenty-five representative shale samples were collected from seven sites outcrops in the Mamfe Basin.

Large-scale hydrogen storage in porous formations presents the opportunity to balance seasonal variation in energy demand. This reservoir modelling study aims to establish dynamic capacity estimates for seasonal hydrogen storage. This study investigates a shallow (&lt;1km) sandstone reservoir, of an onshore anticlinal structure in east Fife, Scotland. This storage evaluation supports the geographically proximal H100 pilot rollout of 100% hydrogen for domestic use in 300 volunteer homes (https://www.sgn.co.uk/H100Fife). The target reservoir comprises a partially explored Carboniferous aquifer, thus this study also addresses the challenge of establishing a workflow for the appraisal of storage sites with limited data availability. We aim to maintain low investment costs for this currently immature technology. A static 3D geological model was constructed in reservoir modelling software, PETREL (Schlumberger), informed by data obtained from legacy seismic surveys and from deep boreholes acquired in a hydrocarbon exploration campaign in the 1980s. A sedimentological study was undertaken on the well-known local and regional Carboniferous sedimentology from subsurface information and coastal exposures to characterise reservoir heterogeneity internally &amp;#8211; a necessary step to address the large data gaps between sparsely available data points. The reservoir is conceptualised as a 60-70m channelised fluvial sand, with unreactive quartz-arkose mineralogy, interbedded with thin mudstone horizons. The top seal is characterised by silts and mudrock, comprising a widespread maximum flooding surface. Seismic and borehole data has enabled a 3D base case model of stratigraphy and structure. Combined reservoir and structure forms a finite element model exported to CMG&amp;#8217;s GEM, used to assess dynamic capacity estimates. Our key research questions are: does the target reservoir exhibit sufficient capacity to support seasonal hydrogen storage based on scenarios informed by industrial experience; what are the cushion gas requirements and associated costs; and what are the key risks and uncertainties influencing capacity estimates. We plan a base case scenario using the most probable geological reservoir and will investigate sensitivity variations around the geology. Benefits from this study include: i) development of a workflow for the hydrogen characterisation of storage reservoirs and the management of risk, whilst minimising initial investment costs, ii) evaluation of cushion gas requirements in a layered reservoir with only a few degrees of dip.

Thus, it would help better understand the fluid processes of the accretion system. This study investigates the Vs structure of the Hyuga‐nada accretionary prism using an array of ocean‐bottom seismometers (OBSs) with a 2 km radius. Teleseismic Green's functions and a surface wave dispersion curve are inverted to one‐dimensional Vs structures using transdimensional inversion. The results indicate the presence of a low‐velocity zone 3–4 km below the seafloor. The reduced Vs corresponds to a reduced Vp feature obtained in a previous seismic refraction survey, and the high Vp/Vs ratio suggests the presence of high pore fluid pressure. In addition, the resolved lithological boundary exhibits a sharp offset that extends laterally across the OBS array. We attribute this offset to a blind fault below while acknowledging other possibilities, such as due to mud diapirism or intense fracturing. The predicted fault is located at the Kyushu–Palau Ridge flank, oriented roughly parallel to the ridge axis, and thus likely caused by ridge subduction. This fault may act as a fluid conduit, contributing to the formation of a fluid reservoir beneath the compacted sediment layers.",en

https://openalex.org/W4322005870,2023,Geology,"Timescale of pervasive melt migration in the continental crustMovement of a large volume of granitic melt is an important factor in the compositional differentiation of the continental crust and the presence of melt in rocks profoundly influences their rheology. Different mechanisms controlling melt migration through crust were proposed. We suggest that pervasive melt flow, analogous to reactive porous melt flow in mantle, could be possibly one of them. It is generally accepted that migration of felsic melts in continental crust starts with short distance pervasive microscopic flow into segregation veins which extract melt. However, we show that pervasive melt flow may be a regional mode of melt migration in continental crust. In such scenario, melt driven by deformation passes pervasively along grain boundaries through the whole rock volume. And the term pervasive melt flow is used for grain-scale, diffuse, porous and reactive flow of felsic silicate melt through rocks. This is effectively an open-system process that thoroughly reworks the resident rock mass. Through-flow of melt destroys pre-existing fabrics and the original chemical and isotopic nature of the protolith. Melt segregation is inefficient and protolith become isotropic granite-like, with partly preserved relics of the original, without ever containing more than a few melt percent at any time. The fabric and geochemical nature of these granites encapsulates the complex history of hybridization.In order to decipher duration of pervasive melt migration we used precise U-Pb monazite ID-TIMS (isotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry) and U-Pb monazite Laser Ablation Split Stream (LASS) geochronology in combination with monazite chemistry as well as U-Pb zircon SHRIMP geochronology. Monazite reveal continuous chemical equilibration with passing melt. They are getting progressively enriched in HREE and depleted in Eu. Monazites in the least affected rock preserve original magmatic zoning in Th and U, in contrast to more with melt equilibrated rock types, where this zoning is lost. Data for each migmatite type reveal&amp;#160; similar date spread for both cores and the Y-rich well defined rims of single monazite grains, indicating a disconnect between U-Pb dates and chemical zoning. There is also no correlation between U-Pb ages and Yb/Gd ratio. This suggest perturbance of the isotopic system. We interpret these random distribution within-grain date variations as a result of dissolution-reprecipitation reactions between monazite grains and melt. During the coupled dissolution-reprecipitation radiogenic Pb was redistributed within the grain. This is supported by dissolution of apatite into silicate melts that stabilizes monazite during migmatitization, preventing their dissolution but not reaction with passing melt. Redistribution of radiogenic Pb resulted in meaningless individual ages from different migmatite types, but gave overall duration of the thermal event &amp;#8211; pervasive melt flow. Duration of pervasive melt flow was dated 8-10myr. This suggest that porous flow of silicate melts in continental crust is a process which can operate over a long time and impacts on the rheology of the crust during orogeny.",en

The study is the first to present melt inclusion data from felsic volcanic rocks of Archean age.Rhyolitic SMI of primary origin were characterized from magmatic quartz phenocrysts from tholeiitic rhyolite sills and calc-alkaline flows near gold-rich volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits. Silicate melt inclusion trace element chemistry records a continuous transition from ocean ridge to volcanic arc tectonic affinity. SMI Sr-Y-La-Yb systematics are &amp;#160;inconsistent with Archean tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG; &amp;#8220;adakitic&amp;#8221;) compositional domains; rather, they are consistent with post-Archean TTG (&amp;#8220;calc-alkaline&amp;#8221;) suggesting significant compositional modification of TTG magmas through contamination and/or plagioclase fractionation during magma storage and ascent. &amp;#160;Thermobarometry suggests prolonged phenocryst residence at depth prior to eruption with SMI entrapment at ~10-12 km depth. Concentrations of Au in the SMI are variable and up to two orders of magnitude higher than in the host bulk volcanic rocks. This demonstrates that whole rock data are not representative of the composition of the original magmatic liquids and, thus, cautioning the traditional use of whole rock data as a proxy for volcanic assemblage fertility in such Archean environments. Moreover, SMI show melt co-entrapment with an immiscible, high density, carbonic fluid (CO2-dominant), indicating that rhyolitic melts were saturated in CO2. Saturation of this fluid phase may explain, in part, the variability observed in SMI metal contents, and demands consideration of the relative importance of early separation of magmatic volatile phases versus seafloor hydrothermal leaching of volcanic products in controlling the magmatic metal endowment of Archean exhalative ore-forming systems. &amp;#160;",en

The target interval of the oilfield belongs to the Paleogene layered structural oil reservoir under the influence of igneous rocks. Due to the widespread development of igneous rocks, and the diversity of igneous rock types, the structure is complex, and the lateral changes are intense. The differences in volcanic eruption intensity and volcanic materials made the igneous rock masses overlap each other, with rapid changes in lithofacies, and complex seismic reflection structures. Therefore, it was difficult to carry out fine characterization of igneous rocks. Based on the lithofacies model, lithofacies combination types, and seismic response characteristics of volcanic mechanisms, this paper summarized three types of development models of volcanic mechanisms in the study area. At the same time, through technical means such as stratigraphic slicing, seismic attribute extraction, and attribute optimization analysis, the spatial distribution characteristics of various facies zones of igneous rocks at different stages were described in detail, achieving precise prediction of igneous rocks in Bozhong S Oilfield.

SSP5‐8.5 forcing with fixed pre‐industrial glacial melt warms all continental shelves, such that historically “cool” and “fresh” shelves transition to “warm.” Additional glacial melt, added at depth, cools the Eastern Ross, Amundsen, and Bellingshausen seas, suggesting a negative feedback on basal melt—a novel result for a coarse resolution coupled model. From the Weddell Sea, along East Antarctica, and into the western Ross Sea—where continental shelves transition to a “warm” state—additional glacial melt increases temperatures at the continental shelf sea floor, suggesting a positive feedback. The sign of the glacial melt–subsurface temperature feedback is critically dependent on continental shelf properties, climate state, and the vertical distribution of glacial melt inputs.",en

The aim of our research is to understand this coupled kinematic and thermal evolution to ultimately infer the conditions favourable for subsurface geo-resources. We achieve this aim by means of numerical modelling and its application to one of the best available orogenic indentation examples, which is the Dinarides Mountains chain in Central Europe. Based on the analysis and modelling of an integrated onshore and offshore geological cross-section, we quantified the shortening, erosion/exhumation and sedimentation/burial rates, maturity of potential petroleum source rocks and the gross potential for sustainable geothermal resources. The coupled kinematic/thermal modelling revealed a general pattern of heat flow variations associated with crustal deformations. The hanging-wall and upper parts of the footwalls show increased conductivity and heat flow during episodes of thrusting, whereas the deepest parts of footwalls have lower heat flow values. Fluids are observed to migrate towards the foreland during the latest Cretaceous – Early Oligocene thrusting. The largest amounts of post-Middle Miocene shortening took place in the SE external parts of the orogen, where deep-sourced fluid ascent took place towards the foreland. In this region, significant footwall burial enhanced the maturation of potential source rocks. Modelling results infer a considerable hydrocarbon potential for the Dalmatian unit and the South Adriatic basin. The kinematic and thermal model combined with geothermal well design and well performance calculations infer a viable geothermal energy potential for the Dalmatian and High-Karst units. Results of this novel workflow allowed to quantify the orogenic kinematic and thermal history, and its bearing on conventional and sustainable geo-resources.",en
https://openalex.org/W4311967376,2023,Geology,"The effect of weak Mohr–Coulomb layers on the onset of caldera collapse - A limit analysis modelling approachCalderas are subcircular volcanic depressions that can occur due to drainage of a subsurface magma reservoir. Numerous models simulating the initiation and growth of caldera collapse consider homogeneous overburden of the magma reservoir. This study describes plastic models implementing limit analysis to investigate the effects of weak layers (low cohesion and low friction) on caldera formation and structure. Our models show that the presence of weak layers within the crust favours the onset of caldera collapse, as it reduces the critical magma underpressure within the magma chamber to initiate roof failure. This effect is more pronounced with greater cumulated thickness of weak layers. In homogeneous models, the onset of caldera collapse is accommodated by a simple, localized outward dipping reverse damage band (caldera fault), whereas in layered models caldera collapse is accommodated by more complex damage structures. Weak layers confine damage underneath the layers, limiting the growth of the caldera fault toward the surface. Calculated stress trajectories are rotated across weak layers, showing that weak layers act as stress barriers. The effect of weak layers is stronger when the layer is closer to the magma reservoir, where layer-parallel damage form underneath the layer, interpreted as a potential detachment level. Multiple layers trigger more distribution of the damage and several layer-parallel damage bands. The subsurface distribution of damage due to weak layers may lead to more distributed surface subsidence, enhancing sagging before a caldera fault reaches the surface. Finally, internal detachments due to weak layers are likely important for observed episodic transient subsurface collapse episodes before collapse occurs at surface. All in all, our models that implement plastic deformation predict significant stress perturbations as a result of varying Mohr–Coulomb properties only. Our study thus shows that widely used static elastic models are not sufficient for physically relevant stress analyses of geological systems. In addition, our study shows that plastic (or elasto-plastic) models are necessary to predict the location and extent of inelastic damage accommodating volcano deformation and failure.",en

Here, we perform such a comparison for both the sea ice area and volume fluxes from October 2016 to December 2021. Nares Strait provided the largest average seasonal (October through September) ice area flux of 95 ± 8 × 10 3 km 2 followed by the CAA regions of the Queen Elizabeth Islands (QEI) at 41 ± 7 × 10 3 km 2 and M’Clure Strait at 2 ± 8 × 10 3 km 2 with corresponding ice volume fluxes of 177 ± 15 km 3 , 59 ± 10 km 3 , and 8 ± 8 km 3 , respectively. Larger Arctic Ocean ice export at Nares Strait was associated with a shorter ice arch duration (237 days) compared to M’Clure Strait (163 days) and QEI (65 days).

This shift is marked by a sharp boundary between a lower layer of medium to fine sand and an upper layer of dark, silty clay that reflects the lagoon closure. The dated sediments also reveal a history of marine conditions in the lagoon basin since about 7400 ± 140 years before the present (ybp), when the sea level was −12.2 meters (m), and the shoreline was 400 m away from the current location. The sea level rose at a rate of 2.84 m per 1000 years until about 4170 ± 100 ybp. After that, the rising sea level slowed and reached the present level about 3100 years ago. However, the lagoon remained closed after about 730 to 1180 ybp, with only fine organic sediment accumulating in the basin, which coincides with a severe drought in the southwest around 1150 AD.

However, little is known of the tectonic controls on the magmatic flare-ups and their implications for crustal thickening. In this paper, we report new zircon UPb age and Hf isotope data for Cretaceous biotite granites, two-mica granites and mafic microgranular enclaves (MMEs) from the large-scale granitic batholiths in Pamir. These and previously published results show there were four episodes of Cretaceous magmatism (124–108, 107–103, 102–92, and 80–70 Ma). The Cretaceous arc migrated progressively landward from Karakoram to Central Pamir with a maximum arc–trench distance of ca. 400 km during the first magmatic episode (124–108 Ma). The igneous rocks are mainly S-type granites with enriched zircon Hf isotopic compositions (ɛHf(t) = −19.8 to −5.4), indicating derivation by partial melting of metasedimentary units. A magmatic flare-up at 105 ± 2 Ma generated voluminous I-type granites and minor mafic igneous rocks that cover ca. 30% of the study area. The I-type granites have higher zircon ɛHf(t) values (−19.0 to −2.0) as compared with those of the earlier S-type granites, which reflect the addition of mantle-derived materials (ca. 30%). The third episode of magmatism (102–92 Ma) generated mainly intermediate–silicic volcanic rocks, which are geochemically similar to I-type granites and have ɛHf(t) values of −15.0 to −1.5. The final episode of magmatism (80–70 Ma) was dominated by alkaline and mafic igneous rocks formed in a post-collisional setting, which have variable ɛHf(t) values of −6.6 to 10.5. Our study highlights that the Early Cretaceous magmatic flare-up in the Pamir–Karakoram terrain was related to foundering of the flat-slab of Neo-Tethys oceanic lithosphere that was previously subducted, which induced voluminous underplating of mantle-derived magma in the lower crust. This process had a key role in crustal thickening in the Pamir–Karakoram terrain prior to the Cenozoic India–Asia collision.",en

Its largest fragments are the Tuva, Delyun–Yustyd, Kan, Agul, and Minusa basins as well as depressions in north-western Mongolia. The paper summarizes the geologic, geochemical, and Sr–Nd isotope characteristics of the ASRS mafic rocks represented by nappes of moderately alkaline and alkali basalts and their subvolcanic and intrusive rock analogues. They are present in all magmatic associations and are divided into low-Ti (TiO2 = 0.2–2.2 wt.%) and high-Ti (TiO2 = 2.2–4.3 wt.%) subgroups. These rocks are characterized by wide variations in Sr isotope characteristics (εSr(T) = –16 to +30). High-Ti mafic rocks are common at the southern segment of the ASRS; they show a weak positive Ta–Nb anomaly (La/Nb = 0.8–1.1) and are relatively enriched in LREE ((La/Yb)N = 6–14) and radiogenic Nd (εNd(T) = 3.8–8.7). Low-Ti varieties are confined to the northwestern segment of the ASRS; they are enriched in Ba but depleted in Th, U, Nb, Ta (La/Nb = 1.2–2.2), Zr, Hf, LREE ((La/Yb)N = 3–7), and radiogenic Nd (εNd(T) = 2.0–6.0). Taking into account the existence of different terranes, which were combined in the structure of the Altai–Sayan folded area during accretion (ca. 500–480 Ma), we propose a model suggesting different environments of magma formation at the southern and northwestern segments of the ASRS and the relationship of magmatism with a mantle plume within the ASRS. In composition the plume corresponds to the sources of high-Ti magmas. The effect of the melted lithospheric mantle of different compositions beneath different groups of terranes led to the observed isotope-geochemical heterogeneity of mafic rocks within the ASRS, in particular, the absence of high-Ti mafic rocks from the Minusa basin.",en

Zircon U–Pb dating shows that the Late Triassic ages, corresponding to 220 Ma and 222 Ma, reveal the mafic–ultramafic and dioritic magmatism in Kaimuqi, respectively. Zircon from gabbro has εHf(t) values of −3.4 to −0.2, with corresponding TDM1 ages of 994–863 Ma. The mafic–ultramafic rocks generally have low SiO2, (Na2O+K2O) and TiO2 contents and high MgO contents and Mg# values. They are relatively enriched in light rare earth elements (LREEs) and large ion lithophile elements (LILEs) and depleted in heavy REEs (HREEs) and high-field-strength elements (HFSEs), indicating that the primary magma was derived from the metasomatized lithospheric mantle. The diorites show sanukitic high-Mg andesite properties (e.g., MgO = 2.78%–3.54%, Mg# = 50–55, Cr = 49.6–60.0 ppm, Sr = 488–512 ppm, Y = 19.6–21.8 ppm, Ba = 583–722 ppm, Sr/Y = 23.5–25.4, K/Rb = 190–202 and Eu/Eu* = 0.73–0.79), with LREEs and LILEs enrichments and HREEs and HFSEs depletions.

New U-Pb zircon analyses of two Passo Feio acidic metavolcanic rocks yield a crystallization age of 580 ± 2 Ma (2σ). Group 1 samples account for a magmatic event at 800–770 Ma in the Várzea do Capivarita and Porongos (Cerro da Árvore sequence) complexes. They represent a magmatic association produced from subduction-related sources, with crustal contribution shown by 87Sr/86Sr(790 Ma) > 0.715 and ƐNd(790 Ma) from −5 and −11 (up to –22). Groups 2 and 3 account for a magmatic event at ca. 600 to 580 Ma in the Passo Feio and western Porongos (Capané sequence) complexes. Groups 2 and 3 rocks are interpreted to have been sourced from subduction-related enriched mantle without major crustal contamination, with 87Sr/86Sr(580 Ma) = 0.7035–0.7050 and ƐNd(580 Ma) > -10. For the basic metavolcanoclastic sample (Bmvc), the data suggest mantle-derived origin without significant contribution of subduction-related sources, possibly indicating multiple sources for this newly-described and not yet fully understood Ediacaran magmatism.

The ice sheet models producing future sea level projections, however, rely on controversial mechanisms to match this rapid response, possibly due to the omission of feedbacks between subglacial water pressure and ice velocity. While modern remote sensing data tie increased subglacial water pressure to ice acceleration, there exists no record of subglacial hydrology long enough to evaluate this feedback on timescales relevant to climate and sea level change. Here we present a ten-thousand-year record of subglacial water dynamics and chemistry from ~110 ka East Antarctic calcite and sediment-bearing subglacial precipitates. Time series of sediment frequency and grain size indicate that changes in subglacial water dynamics correlate with Southern Ocean temperature. Similarly, shifts in calcite composition record climate-driven changes in subglacial water provenance. The synchronized changes in subglacial hydrology with climate support subglacial water drainage systems as having a key role in transferring the climate forcing acting on ice sheet margins, deep into ice sheet interior. The demonstrated coupling between subglacial water and climate clarifies the current rapid ice response to climate change in Antarctica, and underscores a need and means to heighten the sensitivity of ice sheet models.",en

This brief account examines post‐storm observations of inconsistent damage patterns and structural changes along a specific coastal stretch located at the south beach of Eilat. Certain sections of the coastline experienced direct impact from extreme waves on the south‐southeast‐facing shallow reef, resulting in areas where rocks were completely stripped of corals due to sediment backwash. Conversely, areas characterized by ridges and deep troughs saw the loss of branching corals and some massive colonies, while many small corals survived. A neighboring area with a well‐developed fringing reef suffered lesser damage. Between the severely affected shallow reef and the robust fringing reef lies an unconsolidated slope that migrated eastward by at least 2 m following the storm, incorporating numerous coral colonies dislodged by the event. We propose that this slope advances with each major storm occurrence, influencing the characteristics of nearby shores and coral reefs. This case demonstrates how storm events, in conjunction with geomorphology, have a cumulative and significant impact not only on the structure of coral communities but also on the fundamental shape of coral reefs themselves. As climate change amplifies the range, intensity, and frequency of storms, comprehending these processes becomes increasingly crucial.",en

In this study, the geomorphology and sedimentation of the Cairima–Ningmute River at the exit of the Ruoergai Basin were investigated. Combined with the optically stimulated luminescence dating of the sediments, the reconstructed fluvial geomorphology processes are as follows: During ∼50–20 ka, coarse debris such as moraines and glacial mudflows from the Anyemaqen Shan and Xiqing Shan were unloaded to the Maqu valley in the bottleneck reach of the Ruoergai Basin outflow, causing river blockage and lake formation in the upper Ruoergai Basin; during ∼20–12 ka, the headward erosion of the river accelerated from the downstream to the upstream and the barrier dam eroded, forming terraces; since ∼12 ka, the Yellow River has cut through the Ruoergai Basin and has developed two levels of terraces based on lacustrine sediments. Our results suggest that glacial debris flow from the Anyemaqen Shan extensively accumulated at the basin-canyon bottleneck during the last glacial period, and when the amount of sediment accumulation exceeded the amount of river erosion, damming events occurred. The glacial-interglacial cycles during the Quaternary might generate repeated damming and cut-through of the Ruoergai Basin.

Thanks to satellite differential interferometry, we detected the existence of the secondary surface rupture of the quasi-parallel Bayne Rocherenard fault. A newly processed seismic cross-section allowed us to construct a local 3D fault system. Assuming that the earthquake was triggered by the transient increase in hydraulic pressure following heavy rainfall before the event, our numerical 3D simulations demonstrate that the hydraulic pressure gradient is maximum just before the earthquake at the intersection of the two faults, the most probable place of the hypocenter. This hydraulic effect is about two and a half times larger than the cumulative effect of mechanical stress release due to the mass removal from the surface quarry over the two past centuries.",en

https://openalex.org/W4323321775,2023,Geology,"The petrogenetic relationship between migmatite and granite in the Himalayan orogen: Petrological and geochemical constraintsPartial melting of crustal rocks contributes to the formation of granites in collisional orogens. It is generally recognized that residual granulites are compositionally complementary to crustal-derived granites, yet the petrogenetic relationship between migmatites and granites remains obscure. To shed light on this issue, a comprehensive study of field geology, petrographic observations, whole-rock major and trace elements, mineral major elements, zircon and monazite U–Th–Pb isotopes and trace elements, and monazite SmNd isotopes was carried out for the Higher Himalayan leucosomes, leucocratic dikes, and leucogranites from the Cona area in eastern Himalaya. These rocks were formed by partial melting of the Higher Himalayan metasedimentary rocks and granitic gneisses in the Miocene, and are characterized by distinct petrological and geochemical features. Leucosomes and leucocratic dikes, which were derived from different source rocks (granitic gneisses and metasedimentary rocks, respectively), share many similarities. Both of them are rich in K-feldspar and have high K2O, Ba, and Sr contents and CaO/(CaO + Na2O) ratios, but low Rb/Sr and Sm/Nd ratios; LREE contents correlate positively with Th contents, but negatively with P2O5 contents; zircon and monazite have low MREE/HREE ratios. In contrast, leucogranites, which originated from mixed sources of metasedimentary rocks and granitic gneisses, are rich in plagioclase and have low K2O, Ba, and Sr contents and CaO/(CaO + Na2O) ratios, but high Rb/Sr and Sm/Nd ratios; LREE contents correlate positively with Th and P2O5 contents; zircon and monazite have high MREE/HREE ratios. The K2O-rich leucosomes and leucocratic dikes and the Na2O-rich leucogranites do not show geochemical signatures indicative of a link owing to melt evolution processes, suggesting that the two main groups are the products of distinct and independent anatectic processes in the source. The leucosomes and leucocratic dikes are associated with water-fluxed (hydration) melting at lower temperatures and pressures, whereas the leucogranites are related to water-absent (dehydration) melting at higher temperatures and pressures. In this regard, the leucosomes and leucocratic dikes in migmatites and the leucogranites likely represent two different types of anatectic products, which were respectively derived from partial meltig of the hydrated crustal rocks at the shallower level and the dehydrated crustal rocks at the deeper level. The hydrated-dehydrated crustal architecture is ascribed to the influx of water into the shallower crustal rocks caused by metamorphic dehydration at the deeper crustal level. The spatiotemporally coupled dehydration-hydration anatectic processes may be a common mechanism for the formation of coherent granite, migmatite, and granulite in collisional orogens.",en

Forty high-resolution cycles integrated in 15 minor and two major cycles are observed for the first time throughout the Late Pennsylvanian-early Permian units. A-three steps landscape evolution is recognized. First, the lower Cutler beds, mainly corresponded to a marine environment, with longshore bar, subtidal, tidal, mouth-bar, and with locally fluvial deposits. The upper part of the lower Cutler beds also contains an aeolian dune. Second, the Cedar Mesa Sandstone, corresponded to broad erg deposits which are present across the entire study area, whereas longshore bar, subtidal, mouth-bar, and some fluvial deposits are mainly preserved in the northern part of the studied area. Third, the Organ Rock Formation records decreasing aeolian dune field preservation. To the south, the aeolian environments are interbedded with shoreface deposits, whereas to the north, fluvial deposits with some mouth-bars are more developed. Semi-arid climatic conditions persisted, as indicated by the presence of calcretes. Everywhere in these three steps, root traces within sandstone bars indicate that a soil was once present above the sand dunes. This new model of landscape evolution documents complex interactions between aeolian, fluvial and marine environments within the entire Permian succession of the Paradox Basin. High-resolution stratigraphic analyses allow to discuss the significance of the cyclicity in a scenario that take into consideration sea-level variation in the Late Paleozoic Ice Age paleoclimatic context. This Late Pennsylvanian to early Permian succession reflects both relative sea-level fluctuations and the variability of sediment supply.",en

However, the fluid P–T history, which will provide a better insight into gas accumulation and probable leakage in the main reservoir (the Lower Cambrian Longwangmiao Formation) has still yet to be fully understood. This study combines detailed petrographic observations with transmitted light, ultraviolet light, reflected light and cold cathodoluminescence, fluid inclusion microthermometry, Raman spectrometry, 1D basin modeling and fluid P–T modeling techniques to reconstruct the fluid-involved basin evolution of the Longwangmiao Formation in the Anyue region. The results showed that the paragenesis of the Longwangmiao Formation includes dolomite matrix, dolomite 1, dolomite 2, dolomite 3 (saddle dolomite), dolomite 4, quartz and calcite. The first generation of bitumen occurs between dolomite 1 and dolomite 2, corresponding to the primary oil generation of the Lower Cambrian Qiongzhusi Formation at the burial maximal in the Silurian. The second generation of bitumen, corresponding to intense oil cracking into gas, has occurred between dolomite 4 and quartz at a geological period between the Early Jurassic and Early Cretaceous (early Yanshanian movement). Fluid inclusions trapping pressure modeling explains that the trapping pressure increases from dolomite 4 to quartz due to burial and the oil cracking into gas, then stays constant from quartz to calcite due to the sealing of fractures. The open fractures formed after calcite partially reduced the overpressure condition of the Longwangmiao Formation. Collectively, this study will provide necessary information for a better understanding of deeply buried reservoirs to support more efficient development of such reservoirs in higher quality zones and reduce exploration risks and operational costs.",en
https://openalex.org/W4327737571,2023,Geology,"The Dynamics of Transformation of Lithospheric Mantle Rocks Beneath the Siberian CratonThe problem of heat–mass transfer in the permeable areas above the asthenosphere zones was numerically studied based on an examination of the inclusion content in the minerals (olivine and clinopyroxenes) of igneous and metamorphic rocks of the lithospheric mantle and the Earth’s crust; evaluations of thermodynamic conditions of the inclusion formation; and experimental modeling of the influence of hot reduced gases on rocks in the mantle beneath the Siberian craton. The flow of fluids of a certain composition from the upper-mantle magma chambers leads to the formation of zonal metasomatic columns in the ultrabasic mantle lithosphere in the permeable zones of deep faults (starting from the lithosphere base at 6–7 GPa). When petrogenic components enter from the magma pocket, depleted ultrabasic lithospheric mantle rocks change to substrates, which can be considered as the deep counterparts of crustal rodingites. Other fluid compositions result in strong calcination and pronounced salinization of the metasomatized substrates or an increase in the garnet content of the primary ultrabasic matrix. A region of alkaline rocks forms above these areas, which changes to pyroxenes, amphiboles, and biotites. The heat–mass transfer modeling for the two-velocity hydrodynamic model shows that gas–fluid and melt percolation lead to an increase in the thermal front velocity under convective heating and a pressure drop in flow. It is also shown that grospidites are considered to be eclogites, are found in the permeable zones of the lithospheric mantle columns serving as conduits for the melt/fluids and represent the products of the carbonated metasomatic columns. The carbonization caused by proto-kimberlite melts may essentially decrease the diamond grade of kimberlites due to carbon oxidation.",en

An exception to this are a few isolated occurrences of early Archean (3.6-3.2 Ga) barite (BaSO4), hosted in volcano-sedimentary rocks in South Africa, India and Western Australia. The origin of these barite deposits is controversial, despite having been studied over decades. Here, we combine field observations and geochemical data from a multi-year investigation into barite occurrences on the Kaapvaal and Pilbara cratons to derive a holistic model for the formation of early Archean barite. Studied deposits include the 3.52 Ga Londozi deposit in Eswatini and the 3.49 Ga North Pole deposit in Western Australia that are hosted in volcanic rocks, and the 3.26-3.23 Ga Barite Valley deposit in South Africa and possibly time-equivalent but little-known Cooke Bluff deposit in Western Australia that are found in sedimentary successions. Our field observations indicate that barite is closely associated with chert on both the Kaapvaal and the Pilbara cratons, although the scale of barite mineralization is much larger in the Pilbara and cross-cutting barite veins are only observed at North Pole and Cooke Bluff. These findings suggest that the fluids from which the chert precipitated are the same as the fluids from which the barite formed, and geochemical data support an origin for these barium-rich fluids that is related to low-temperature hydrothermal circulation of seawater. Barite precipitation could have been triggered by silica removal from these fluids. The ubiquity of chert in the early rock record suggests that these settings may have been common in the early Archean and that barite formation was therefore limited by sulfate abundance, and could only occur in settings where hydrothermal circulation and local sulfate enrichment occurred together.",en

In particular, in the case of Dadae Beach, located at the estuary of the Nakdong river estuary, it is located at the boundary between the river and the ocean, and it is an environment in which various deposition mechanisms operate. It is a very difficult research task to analyze the beach evolution mechanism, and a long-term study using precise measurement methods is required. Therefore, in this study, precision unmanned aerial surveys were conducted three times (2015, 2019, and 2021) for 5 years to identify the sedimentary characteristics of Dadae Beach, and the sedimentary environment was analyzed through the analysis of surface sediment texture characteristics. Seasonal waves and winds caused by the East Asian monsoon climate are the main mechanisms for the sedimentation of Dadae Beach, and finegrained sediments are distributed throughout the beach. In addition, the formation of sandbar, which arose rapidly due to artificial influences such as the construction of estuary banks in the past, is a major factor in the evolution of large-scale beaches. This study is meaningful in identifying the mechanism of beach evolution and presenting quantitative analysis results through comparison of precision aerial survey data over a long period of time.",en

The main aim of research is to study the bottom sediments of the Sasyk estuary, in particular, to establish their lithological characteristics and the peculiarities of the distribution of heavy metals in their layers. Method. The research was done with the results of the expedition work carried out in 2018-2019, 31 samples of the bottom sediments of the Sasyk estuary, channels and paleochannels of the Kogylnyk and Sarata rivers, and rocks of the shoreline of the studied reservoir were selected. We carried out sampling along the network of 31 stations from a motor boat using a bottom-grab and orientation by GPS navigation. The content of heavy metals was determined using geochemical spectral emission analysis. Statistical and cartographic processing of the research results was carried out using geographic information systems Mapinfo, QGIS, Global Mapper and Surfer. Also, to establish the possible routes of metal migration, we used the analysis of mesotopolineaments formed according to the NASA SRTM digital terrain model, with the construction of rose diagrams of the main directions of the lineaments. The results. We established that the bottom sediments were represented mainly by grey-black, black, viscous silt, often with an admixture of shell detritus. Less often, they were composed of sand, sometimes muddy with abundant fauna. We also determined the content of heavy metals in the system of bottom sediments, features of their distribution and possible ways of infusing. Thus, in the territory of the Sasyk estuary, heavy metals of the first (Pb), second (Ni, Cu, Cr, Mo) and third (V, Mn, Ba) hazard class are found in high concentrations. The average content of Pb for the bottom sediment system of the estuary is: for sand – 32 mg/kg, for silt – 41 mg/kg. The maximum content for both is 100 mg/kg. The average Ni content is: for sand – 27 mg/kg, for silt – 62 mg/kg. The maximum content for sand is 80 mg/kg, for silt – 100 mg/kg. The average Cu content in the silt of the Sasyk estuary is 81 mg/kg, and 26 mg/kg in the sand. An elevated content of Mn, Ba and Mo was also found in several samples. Оften areas with increased concentrations of metals have a point character. In almost all cases, they are connected to the river systems adjacent to the pond. The distribution of some metals is correlated with the main directions of estuary water circulation. Wastewater is a likely sources of metals entering the estuary geoecosystem. We also assume that the migration of these elements to the pond may occur through tectonic blocks. Scientific novelty. For the first time in recent years, we have carried out expeditionary work on research of the bottom sediments of the Sasyk estuary, along the complete network of the station. We obtained the data on the gross content of heavy metals, and determined their average, maximum and minimum concentrations. For the first time, maps of the spatial distribution of metals were constructed, which made it possible to establish the main regularities of their accumulation in the bottom sediment system of the pond. Practical significance. Pollution of the bottom sediments of the Sasyk estuary with heavy metals is one of the components of today's critical ecological state of the pond, which affects the well-being of the residents of the surrounding areas. The obtained results can be used at the state level to create effective programs for quality management of the resource potential of the estuary.",en

Regional morphologic and seismic characteristics suggest that Seubadeh village is an area that stores tsunami deposits, both new tsunami deposits and prehistoric tsunami deposits. Therefore, in this study, the search for paleotsunami deposits was carried out in Seubadeh village. The tsunami deposit samples were taken at several points in Seubadeh village using a hand drill with a depth of more than 2 m. Sediment classification of the collected samples using Troels-Smith method shows a candidate layer of paleotsunami tsunami deposit was found between two clay deposits. The layer is dominated by plant roots and shell material. In addition, the sediment samples were sieved using a mesh to evaluate the grain size distribution of clay, silt and sand. The results of the grain size distribution and color evaluation of the respective layer are presented. The results of the analysis of the particle size distribution in the sample and the color of the sample indicate that there are 2 layers that show characteristics as a paleotsunami deposit, namely at a depth of about 170-200 cm and 280-292 cm.

However, evidence for the age calibration of this unconformity (e.g., from biostratigraphy) is limited. A previously undescribed assemblage of larger benthic foraminifera has been discovered in a section at Khormuj in the Coastal Fars region of the Iranian Zagros. This section lies in the uppermost Sarvak Formation, directly beneath the major unconformity surface. Dominant components of the assemblage are Mangashtia viennoti Henson, and Reticulinella? kaeveri Cherchi, Radoičić and Schroeder. Their presence places the uppermost Sarvak Formation at this locality in the age range (upper?) middle – ?lower upper Turonian, and in the context of evidence from other localities in the region it is most likely upper middle Turonian. This provides new constraint on the timing of the unconformity and stratigraphic organisation, and the tectonic events leading to its creation (e.g., forebulge creation related to ophiolite obduction).

https://openalex.org/W4327873991,2023,Geology,"The development of multiple phases of superposed rifting in the Turkana Depression, East Africa: Evidence from receiver functionsThe Turkana Depression in Eastern Africa separates the elevated plateaus of East Africa to the south and Ethiopia-Yemen to the north. It remains unclear whether the Depression lacks dynamic mantle support, or if the entire East Africa region is dynamically supported and the Depression compensated isostatically by thinned crust. Also poorly understood is how Miocene-Recent extension has developed across the Depression, connecting spatially separated magmatic rift zones in Ethiopia and Kenya. Receiver function analysis is used to constrain Moho depth and bulk-crustal VP/VS ratio below new seismograph networks in the Depression, and on the northern Tanzania craton. Crustal thickness is ∼40 km below northern Uganda and 30–35 km below southern Ethiopia, but 20–30 km below most of the Depression, where mass-balance calculations reveal low elevations can be explained adequately by crustal thinning alone. Despite the fact that magmatism has occurred for 45 Ma across the Depression, more than 15 Ma before East African Rift (EAR) extension initiated, bulk crustal VP/VS across southern Ethiopia and the Turkana Depression (∼1.74) is similar to that observed in areas unaffected by Cenozoic rifting and magmatism. Evidence for voluminous lower crustal intrusions and/or melt, widespread below the Ethiopian rift and Ethiopian plateau to the north, is therefore lacking. These observations, when reviewed in light of high stretching factors (β≤2.11), suggest Cenozoic extension has been dominated until recently by faulting and plate stretching, rather than magma intrusion, which is likely an incipient process, operating directly below seismically-active Lake Turkana. Early-stage EAR basins to the west of Lake Turkana, with associated stretching factors of β≈2, formed in crust only moderately thinned during earlier rifting episodes. Conversely, ∼23 km-thick crust beneath the Kino Sogo Fault Belt (KSFB) has small offset faults and thin sedimentary strata, suggesting almost all of the observed stretching occurred in Mesozoic times. Despite the KSFB marking the shortest path between focused extensional zones to the north and south, seismicity and GPS data show that modern extension is localized below Lake Turkana to the west. Failed Mesozoic rift zones, now characterized by thinned crust and relatively refractory mantle lithosphere, are being circumnavigated, not exploited by EAR rifting.",en
https://openalex.org/W4385068333,2023,Geology,"IESDB – the Iberian Evaporite Structure DatabaseAbstract. Evaporites flow in the solid state under relatively low differential stress and have unique mechanical properties compared to other sedimentary rocks. Worldwide, they control the structural and stratigraphical architecture of many basins and orogens in ancient and active tectonic settings. Moreover, they host mineral deposits and play a key role in petroleum systems because they typically act as seals due to their low permeability, and their ability to flow results in the formation of structural hydrocarbon traps such as folds and faults in their encasing rocks. Additionally, evaporite structures can be used as subsurface storage sites for geo-energy applications and nuclear waste. The systematic characterisation of subsurface evaporite structures is thus key for the development of geoscience-based technologies to address societal challenges. Owing to their value, massive amounts of surface and subsurface information about (among others) the stratigraphy, structure, geochemistry, and petrophysical properties of evaporite structures and their surrounding rocks have been acquired by Earth scientists, petroleum and mining exploration companies, and geological surveys. However, the data often appear segregated (i.e. in the form of database fragments, scientific articles, and unpublished reports), are not systematically organised, and are sometimes not fully accessible. This contribution presents the Iberian Evaporite Structure Database (IESDB), the first comprehensive assessment that focuses on evaporite structures carried out in any region of the world. The IESDB includes information and figures for 150 evaporite structures and their surrounding rocks inventoried in Spain and Portugal and is sourced from other six thematic databases and more than 1500 published and unpublished scientific documents. The database targets undeformed to slightly deformed evaporite successions, outcropping and buried diapirs, evaporite-cored anticlines, evaporite-detached thrusts, and allochthonous evaporite bodies. Collated data include information about the structure, stratigraphy, event chronology, surface and subsurface data availability, mining activity, and key bibliographic references. The IESDB follows the FAIR principles of database management (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and is presented as an interactive web page and an open-access database, where indexed structures can easily be selected from a map or browser and filtered by a search engine. The IESDB intends to be a useful resource for teaching (i.e. pointing out examples of exceptional evaporite outcrops), academic and industry research (i.e. identifying knowledge deficits on specific structures or tectonic settings), and for the sustainable exploration and appraisal of mineral resources and geo-energy applications (i.e. representing a terminus a quo for site selection and suitability assessment). The framework provided by the IESDB is an opportunity to enhance the scientific research on Iberian evaporite structures in Spain and Portugal and to take advantage of their scientific and economic potential to tackle important societal challenges faced by these countries. The IESDB is freely available at https://iesdb.eu (last access: 15 June 2023) and the datasets can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.20350/digitalCSIC/14586 (González-Esvertit et al., 2022).",en

In the present study, a systematic petrographic, phase equilibrium modeling and zircon U-Pb geochronological study of a Paleoproterozoic mafic granulite (garnet two-pyroxene granulite) from the Kuluketage area, northern Tarim were conducted. Phase equilibrium modeling demonstrates a decompression–heating clockwise P-T path involving the prograde metamorphic stage (M1) at ∼ 950 °C / 12 kbar, the peak metamorphic stage (M2) at ∼ 1020 °C / 10 kbar, and the retrograde stage (M3) at ∼ 880 °C / 7 kbar. The decompression heating P-T path generally occurs in the post-collisional lithospheric extension setting which may contribute the UHT metamorphism of the M2 stage.

We interpret the ∼ 2.45 Ga magmatic event as an older captured zircon age corresponding to a widely reported magmatic event of ∼ 2.4–2.5 Ga in Kuluketage. The slightly younger ∼ 2.3 Ga magmatic event may correspond to the crystallization age of the mafic granulite’s protolith, however, rarely reported in northern Tarim.

However, in many rift basins, it is difficult to obtain evidence for elevated heat flow accompanying rifting, since paleotemperature data from drilled sections typically record heating related to post-rift burial. Here we integrate geochemical, geophysical and petrophysical data from the Duntroon Sub-basin, Great Australian Bight, that show how strain-migration during multiphase extension can preserve the signature of syn-rift elevated geothermal gradients. During the late Jurassic–early Cretaceous, rifting was focussed along ~ESE-striking normal fault systems in the northern part of the Duntroon Sub-basin. During the late Cretaceous, strain migrated to the southwest through the development of normal faults which accommodated the deposition of Upper Cretaceous strata. The Echidna-1 well was drilled into a basement high, in the footwall of a late Cretaceous fault system, penetrating ~2.5 km of Lower Cretaceous strata. Paleotemperature proxies define an early Cretaceous paleogeothermal gradient of ~60°C km−1, substantially higher than the present-day gradient. Our results indicate that preserved Lower Cretaceous strata were more deeply buried by ~1 km of additional section, which was likely eroded during an episode of mid-Cretaceous exhumation associated with the migrating locus of rifting; this enabled the preservation of thermal signature of elevated syn-rift heat flow. Similar evidence is also observed in the Otway Basin, demonstrating the regional extent of elevated syn-rift heat flow along the southern Australian margin.",en

The caldera was discovered in 2009. Since then, the focus has been primarily on biological studies. During the R/V Polarstern cruise PS119 in 2019, we gained new insights into the morphology, petrology and the formation of the Kemp Caldera. The ship's multibeam data provide an overview of the caldera bathymetry and backscatter characteristics. The new data revealed that the caldera is nested with two or possibly three concentric calderas. TV‐sled and remotely operated vehicle (ROV) observations provide detailed visual data for the hydrothermally active sites of the vent field at the central resurgent cone and flare site at the NNW caldera rim. The central vent field is dominated by white smokers, where clams, sponges and other fauna thrive, while at the flare site inactive as well as actively venting chimneys have been found. The latter are characterized by metal‐enriched fluids of temperatures ≥200°C. During ROV dives, rock samples were collected from the cone, providing the first information about the Kemp Caldera rock composition. The caldera rocks are dacitic, in contrast to the basalts and andesites of the neighboring Kemp Seamount. This suggests that the dacitic cone was formed by one or more later eruptions of differentiated magma, probably stored in shallow intrusions which are driving hydrothermal activity.",en

https://openalex.org/W4367056039,2023,Business,"The Enterprise at the Service of Society in the 21st centuryThis Special Issue is a collection of papers presented at the 32nd Annual Conference of the European Business Ethics Network (EBEN), which took place in Valencia (Spain) on 12–14 June 2019 and was entitled “Enterprise at the Service of Society”. It is no secret that we live in a time of profound and rapid change: we hear talk of Industry 4.0, artificial intelligence, digital transformation and teleworking, but much less about the service that enterprises can provide to society. For ages, business ethics literature has paid significant attention to business in society, often emphasising corporate social responsibilities (Crane et al., 2008; Garriga & Melé, 2004; Laasch et al., 2020) and, more recently, the necessity to contribute to sustainability (Blackburn, 2015). These approaches reflect different underlying perspectives, motivations and philosophical grounds. There is often an emphasis on business and economic results (Farver, 2019), but a sense of commitment can also exist without omitting the return on investment. Philosophical grounds generally include stakeholder theory (Freeman et al., 2018; Harrison et al., 2019), contractual views (Francés-Gómez, 2018) and, more recently, a common good-based approach (Arjoon et al., 2018; De Swaan, 2020; Melé, 2020). The general idea that companies have an obligation to serve society and the planet has not been sufficiently explored in the business ethics literature. Searches for the keyword “service” are more likely to yield results related to particular “services” such as “financial service”, “healthcare service”, “customer service”, “public service”, etc., cases in which the term “service” tends to correspond to a department or functional division within a company. Only the literature specifically focused on leadership seems to have established the term “servant leadership” as a theoretical construct to identify a particular ethically defensible form of leadership (Greenleaf, 2002). However, it is worth noting that in this case “service” is used as an adjective, not a noun. With the hope of explaining what we consider to be a shortcoming, and propose alternatives, we intend to explore—in a cross-cutting and comprehensive manner—the service that enterprises should provide to society. It is true that enterprises emerge in society, develop in society and utilise structures of society that provide them with political and financial stability, as well as legal safeguards. They also enjoy the benefits of citizen education and training, as well as energy, communications and transport infrastructures. In return, in fruitful symbiosis, the enterprise channels an essential service to society by, for example, providing employment, generating wealth and paying taxes. Many set aside a portion of their profits to social actions. In fact, enterprises help society in many ways that are perhaps less apparent or quantifiable: they generate knowledge, develop culture, facilitate learning and collaboration in organisations, make products and services accessible, act as a conduit for creativity and innovation at the service of society, care—or should care—for the environment, facilitate an array of human relationships and provide social cohesion, research new products, take on challenges, facilitate the ability to find meaning in work, favour the development of other supplier companies and customers, etc. It is of course possible to construe these actions and attitudes as a response to an implicit contract between society and business (cf. Francés-Gómez, 2018). However, this analogy must often be overly broadened in order to encompass all the instances and types of contributions that businesses can or do provide to human communities and to describe the exact place that firms occupy in society. Remarkably little attention has been paid to the undeniable fact that businesses should and do serve society, as well as to the possible ethical, managerial and critical implications of this fact. As all human issues can be improved, despite the increasing societal awareness regarding care for the environment, it is worth asking whether enterprises have made the necessary transition—not in a cosmetic way, but rather with an ethical grounding—to implementing corrective measures that allow for increasingly dignified working conditions that contribute to personal development with an appropriate balance between work and family life. Business activity is therefore not only a matter of economic benefits, but also contributes, in turn, to make this wealth “fair”, since the benefits are obtained from the measured and sustainable exploitation of natural resources: it must implement the so-called circular economy. The enterprise must also facilitate fair competition by preventing oligopolies or monopolies that contribute to corruption, fraud in connection with public authorities, the vulnerability of citizens, artificial price increases and other issues that unquestionably constitute a scourge that curtails any social growth in many countries. Reflecting on the business-society relationship is fortunately not new, although important questions for the future remain to be clarified and the debate on them continues, especially if we look in terms of service. The issues mentioned in the previous paragraph can be summarised in the idea that businesses contribute to the common good of society through their specific productive, commercial and organisational activities, this notion of the common good tracing back to Aristotelian and scholastic roots (Melé, 2002; Sison & Fontrodona, 2012; Smith, 1999; Wong & Rae, 2011). Businesses contribute to the creation of these essential common goods and this role constitutes the foundation of their ethical justification and duties to society. The notion of service is implicit in this literature, but it is important to bring it to the fore and discuss its potential implications for business ethics in practice. Understanding the creation of common goods as a service for society seems to be an underdeveloped concept in the existing literature concerning the common good as the moral foundation for business ethics. A reflection on how contributing to the common good is a service to society should clarify the ethical relationship between business and society. The proper relationship between society and business is routinely described as a relation of dialogue (Arenas et al., 2007). What Garriga and Melé (2004) termed “integrative theories”, that is, CSR theories that assume that business must respond to social needs, rely for the most part on dialogue—sometimes labelled “multi-stakeholder dialogue”—as the proper way for corporations to understand social needs and start defining their policies in response. However, dialogue tends to play an instrumental role. It is merely a way for the manager to clarify issues, limit risks and avoid mistakes. The exception may be the so-called “political approach” to CSR (Heath et al., 2010; Pies et al., 2009), in particular those theories drawing on Habermas's and Apel's discourse ethics (Luyckx & Janssens, 2016; Palazzo & Scherer, 2006), where idealised dialogue is used as a philosophical method to discover what justice requires. But even in this case, and perhaps to an even greater extent, dialogue partakes in theories that aim to establish rights and duties among equals. The notion of service is absent from them. In our view, the idea of serving society may contribute to this literature by adding motivational force to the conclusions of discursive reason and actual agreements. Without a notion that business must be of service to people, what would be the reason to start a multi-stakeholder dialogue in the first place? Furthermore, what could be called a “sense of service” maintains a dimension that goes beyond the organisational sphere, a personal dimension that is projected on the leadership factor and that can be conceived as the virtue required by leaders who wish to serve, that is, who put the act of serving before any other activities (Melé, 2020, p. 196). The latter issue connects with the servant leadership model proposed by Robert Greenleaf, whose epistemological premise is that it begins with a natural feeling of wanting to serve. And, moreover, to serve first and foremost. This conscious choice brings one to aspire to lead, an aspiration that manifests itself in ensuring that the needs of those being served are being met (Greenleaf, 2002, p. 27). And, even further, the touchstone of this understanding of leadership would be the following: “Do those served grow as persons; do they, while being served, become healthier, wiser, freer, more autonomous, more likely themselves to become servants?” (Greenleaf, 2002, p. 27). Throughout this Special Issue, we have chosen to include three thematic blocks: the first is defined by its explicit appeal to the common good, which is conceived as a benchmark in the actions of managers of enterprises involved in both the collaborative economy and financial institutions, as well as interactions between stakeholders and managers of sustainable banking institutions within the “Global Alliance for Banking on Values” (GABV). The second block includes articles analysing how the notion of service emerges from dialogue in different contexts and may help direct CSR policies in an effective way. Finally, the third thematic block focuses on servant leadership. Within the framework of the first thematic block, Morales-Sánchez et al. propose a theoretical and normative study that analyses the conditions of possibility by which the so-called “collaborative economy” could contribute to the common good, despite the risks that such a proposal entails. For their part, Chivite, Vázquez and Chivite conducted a field study covering 278 companies in the collaborative economy sector and considered the appropriateness of conferring an ethical substrate to the platforms on which they operate. With regard to Guitián's contribution, it is worth mentioning that he appeals to the doctrine of the Catholic Church as an institution that can rectify the actions of the managers of financial institutions which, having a profit motive, do not always combine their social utility with customer service in times of financial crisis (Dembinski, 2009). With regard to the appeal to the common good, Naranova-Nassauer's contribution explores the interactions between stakeholders and the managers of sustainable banks in the “Global Alliance for Banking on Values” (GABV), noting that the degree of interaction remains at a merely conventional level and therefore far from the vicinity of the common good. In relation to the second thematic block—which aims to facilitate a dialogue between enterprise and society—Horiguchi advocates, through comparative case studies, overcoming the contradictions underlying attempts to make corporate social responsibility explicit in Japanese companies, conceived as “micro moral unity”, even where implicit CSR policies exist within them already. For her part, Cornea considers the impact of corporate responsibility policies in environments where employee layoffs are advocated. With regard to the appeal to a dialogue between enterprise and society, Mion and Tessari investigate new forms of social service organisations through a case study of 33 Italian non-profit organisations with common ethical values and a religious charisma called upon to establish themselves as agencies capable of developing virtuous and sustainable communities, insofar as they have a clear and well-defined purpose and adequately defined criteria for the selection of new members. Lastly, the third thematic block—which incorporates the servant leadership factor as a galvanising element that strengthens the vocation of service to society inherent in every enterprise—starts with the contribution of Speece et al., who conducted research on spirituality based on compassion and honesty, as experienced first-hand by women small business owners in Thailand. For their part, Pablo Ruiz-Palomino et al. carried out research based on a large sample of businesses in the hospitality industry in Spain using quantitative techniques through multilevel structural equation modelling. In turn, this included items such as “servant leadership”, “organizational citizenship behaviour” (OCB) and “team-based internal social capital” in order to explore the impact of individual and organisational attitudes on the process by which servant leadership produces better results in work groups (team performance) and, ultimately, better opportunities for individual flourishing and a contribution to the common good. Finally, with regard to the appeal to servant leadership, Scalzo et al. provide a theoretical foundation for business ethics and servant leadership based on the transcendental anthropology of Leonardo Polo and the personalist philosophy introduced by Emmanuel Mounier. We hope that this Special Issue will serve as a spearhead to develop further academic and interdisciplinary conversations in relation to the major issues that should guide the endeavours of modern organisations. To achieve this goal, it will be necessary to generate an intersection between the contributions of the academic world and the professional experiences drawn from the day-to-day lives of the organisations' managers. In other words, the multiple facets of service to citizens and society as a whole will emerge inasmuch as the commitment to service within any organisation is not a flash in the pan, but the result of a cooperative effort between academics and managers.

The paper investigates the relationship between the FRAND determination process under such a proposal and the test developed by the European Court of Justice (CJEU) in Huawei v. ZTE, which represents the current guiding framework for SEP licensing negotiations in the EU. The paper aims at demonstrating that even, if the SEP Proposal were not to displace Huawei, it endorses an anti-injunction approach which is inconsistent with the CJEU’s stance and is essentially triggered by the German case law.KEYWORDS: Standard essential patentsFRAND determinationcompetition lawinjunctionswilling licensee testconciliation Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Notes1 European Commission, Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on Standard Essential Patents and Amending Regulation (EU) 2017/1001, COM(2023)232.2 ibid Recital 2.3 See Group of Experts on Licensing and Valuation of Standard Essential Patents, ‘Contribution to the Debate on SEPs’ [2021] <https://ec.europa.eu/docsroom/documents/45217> (all websites last visited on 4 November 2023); European Commission, ‘Making the most of the EU’s innovative potential.

https://openalex.org/W4382196829,2023,Business,"LEGO and the Infrastructural Limits of Open PlayLEGO and Adult Hobbyism For much of its history, LEGO has been regarded as a – if not the – children’s toy. Partially through The LEGO Group (TLG)’s own careful deployment of research on constructivist learning, the building system’s recombinatory logic, bright colours, and foot-destroying durability have become associated with paradigmatic notions of what children’s play is and does (Giddings; Maddalena). And yet the world of adult LEGO hobbyism is complex, rich, and worthy of scholarly attention in its own regard. As recent headlines about the popularity of toys among adults have indicated, LEGO is increasingly viewed as a legitimate adult pastime, if not investment opportunity (Peachey; Fuller and Dorning). Over the course of the pandemic, TLG very carefully targeted whole product lines towards adult builders. Themes like Architecture, Creator Expert, Art, and Botanicals are marketed as tools for adult mindfulness and meditation: expensive 3D colouring books that, when finished, belong on walls, office desks, or coffee tables as display pieces, rather than ending up in pieces on the floor. Such sets may even be accompanied by Spotify playlists meant to serve as ambient noise during building (for more on this topic, see Ogden). But LEGO has been used, collected, and modified by adult enthusiasts for decades, spawning the large and vibrant community of self-identified Adult Fans of LEGO, or AFOLs (Jennings). LEGO serves as the medium for a wide and surprisingly varied matrix of practices undertaken quite seriously by these committed hobbyists, as well as scores of artists and entrepreneurs – including those whose building and collecting practices put them at odds with the AFOL community (Taylor and Ingraham). These practices include, but are not limited to, crafting and circulating instructions for fan-made creations (My Own Creation, or MOCs), either as a hobby or a lucrative business; creating LEGO sculptures for private collectors, museums, fan conventions, and art galleries; designing and printing LEGO-compatible pieces and minifigure accessories that LEGO itself cannot or will not create; and modifying minifigures with decals and/or commercial-quality printing, most often to resemble characters from media franchises for which LEGO does not have licensing agreements. Given how expensive LEGO is, and how difficult it can be to acquire individual pieces through LEGO’s own Website (particularly in bulk), almost all these practices rely on ready access to aftermarket sources of LEGO. While Facebook and eBay are common resources for used or pre-purchased sets, Bricklink is the most popular site for serious builders. Dubbed the ‘LEGO eBay’, it provides a platform for hundreds of thousands of individual sellers from all over the world to make their pieces available to millions of buyers. In Bricklink’s cataloguing system, every type of piece is given a part number (the same as LEGO uses), and the site provides the piece breakdown for (almost) every set; every Bricklink seller is required to catalogue their own inventory using this system. As a result, buyers can search for and purchase any piece that LEGO has made, in any colour available, either used or new, and at quantity. Because these are sourced from individual sellers and not LEGO directly, and both buyers and sellers can rate each other’s service (as on any good platform), Bricklink works far better than LEGO (or Facebook and eBay, for that matter) to service the kinds of bulk and specialised piece purchases required by both dabblers and serious hobbyists. If you’ve lost pieces required to assemble a set, look for them on Bricklink, where you can sort by brick condition, country of seller, and number of available pieces; if you want to collect Star Wars-themed minifigures, but don’t care for the grey-monotone spaceships they come with, itemise and inventory the unwanted pieces and sell them on your Bricklink storefront. You can also browse for whole sets, in new or used condition; official instructions; and instructions for user-created MOCs. You can even purchase the colourful cardboard boxes (emptied) in which LEGO sets come packaged. In the conversations my colleagues and I had with LEGO hobbyists, artists, and entrepreneurs, which formed the basis for our edited volume on LEGO as material medium, it became clear that Bricklink features centrally in their creative practices (Taylor and Ingraham). It constitutes a vital infrastructure for the teeming exchange in aftermarket LEGO, amounting to millions of transactions and billions of plastic pieces a year. It is, as one influential LEGO blogger put it, the “lifeblood” of the hobbyist community (Ong). Acknowledging Bricklink’s vital role among adult LEGO enthusiasts, this article takes up the implications of its acquisition by TLG in 2019, and the company’s subsequent efforts to curtail what it regards as unsanctioned uses of its product. Where journalistic coverage largely focussed on the ambivalence with which the AFOL community regards Bricklink’s acquisition (Wood), I turn instead to the effects that it has had (and may yet have) on the artists and entrepreneurs for whom LEGO is not just a creative medium, but a livelihood. To do so, I approach LEGO as a media platform, one engaged – as other commercial platforms are – in extending monopolistic reach over the means through which we craft and exchange cultural productions. LEGO as Platform Since losing its legal monopoly over interlocking bricks, allowing for hobbyists and other toy manufacturers to create products that are LEGO-compatible, TLG has pursued other means to dictate how its products are used (Rimmer). Namely, it has grown and leveraged its power as a media platform, using a combination of technical, discursive, and infrastructural techniques to shape how users produce and circulate their LEGO creations. In understanding LEGO as a media platform, I am more concerned with the ways in which the toy construction system operates as an apparatus of creation and connection, rather than its transmedial reach across movies, video games, television shows, and so on (which is how LEGO is more frequently discussed by media scholars; see Hains and Mazzarella). Tarleton Gillespie’s generative theorisation of platforms is useful in this regard, for the ways in which it deconstructs the semantic richness of the term and shows the ways in which media companies traffic in these manifold meanings. Gillespie speaks of the “figurative” sense of platforms (as structures that enable meaningful activity); the “computational” sense (as software operating systems); the “architectural” sense (the oldest and most mundane use of the term, as a technique of physical elevation); and in the political sense, as an organisation’s core values (Gillespie 349–50). As a “materially digital” building system, LEGO operationalises all these senses (Maddalena). It is at once a physical computational platform, particularly if we consider the numerous product lines as different applications; a tool for supporting creative expression, both in tangible and discursive ways (architectural and figurative platform, respectively); and a company that very publicly engages in progressivist education and safely progressive politics. For the LEGO hobbyists and entrepreneurs mentioned above, those who are most invested in LEGO as a medium of expression rather than as an education tool, the architectural and computational aspects of LEGO are most immediate. LEGO is their medium of choice, the recombinatory potentials of its elements making it possible to translate virtually any experience or artifact into LEGO form: in other words, to “LEGOfy” it (Ingraham and Taylor). These creators have come up with numerous applications of the toy, some mentioned above (and documented more exhaustively in our other work), from minifigure modification to self-published MOCs. Such applications frequently undermine the careful work carried out by TLG to position LEGO as a progressive and family-oriented educational tool: as a figurative and political platform for constructive play. Below are two examples of small businesses whose products created for adult LEGO enthusiasts produce tensions between these various facets of LEGO’s platform. Making Guns and Breaking Bad BrickArms manufactures small arms to fit in the small arms of LEGO’s iconic minifigures: scale models of actual historical or contemporary weapons, as well as some science fiction-themed killing machines. In glib terms, BrickArms makes guns, many of them, for LEGO minifigures. Their products are used extensively by hobbyists and other entrepreneurs because they fill a void left by LEGO’s consistently stated (if inconsistently exercised) stance against military weaponry. BrickArms does not sell its products directly; rather, they are sold through other small businesses like the military-themed set maker Brickmania, which also features BrickArms weapons in its products. If BrickArms undermines LEGO’s figurative platform by producing a range of realistic weapons that are at once technically interoperable and ideologically incompatible with the toy, custom minifigure makers like Citizen Brick (which also sells BrickArms products on its Website) pose a related, but different threat. Citizen Brick produces adult-themed minifigures, accessories, and pieces by imprinting official LEGO elements with designs that are frequently raunchy, violent, and/or flagrantly in violation both of TLG’s intellectual property arrangements with other media franchises, as well as its family-friendly brand image. For instance, one popular Citizen Brick product is the “Chemistry Enthusiast”, a minifigure which bears a striking (albeit LEGOfied) resemblance to science teacher-turned-meth-magnate Walter White from Breaking Bad. Both Citizen Brick and BrickArms operate legally, producing LEGO-compatible products, but both quite deliberately (even gleefully, in the case of Citizen Brick and its tongue-in-cheek marketing) undermine TLG’s core values. These and other similar businesses, not to mention countless hobbyist MOC-makers, present TLG with a conundrum: how to stop entrepreneurs, hobbyists, and artists from creating and distributing violent, reactionary, and/or non-family-friendly uses of a product that is otherwise celebrated for its limitless expressive potential? To put it in terms familiar to media theorists: how might TLG, as platform owner, moderate undesirable content – in this case, content that is tactile and material rather than virtual? Re-Assembling Bricklink Content moderation may not have been the sole reason between TLG’s decision to purchase Bricklink from South Korean tech business Nexon; certainly, gaining access to the data on users’ inventories and transactions was also among its key considerations. But the actions taken by TLG shortly after it took control suggest that curbing undesirable uses of its product (particularly those carried out for commercial purposes) was at least one major goal. While TLG rationalised its purchase of Bricklink in terms of supporting its users (“empower the creativity of AFOLs and fuel future innovations”), its first steps were to ban products that featured builds of characters and scenes from media franchises outside of LEGO’s current license partnerships (Bricklink). It also banned the circulation of user-generated LEGO-interoperable products; notable among these banned products were those made by BrickArms. TLG’s rationale for banning BrickArms was that LEGOfied assault rifles are incommensurate with the values of LEGO – that is, with its status as a figurative and political platform. This is consistent with its public statements (published in 2010, and no longer available online) regarding its refusal to produce certain tools of violence for its own product lines: “the basic aim is to avoid realistic weapons and military equipment that children may recognize from hot spots around the world and to refrain from showing violent or frightening situations when communicating about LEGO products” (TLG, quoted by Lendon). As laudable as this corporate stance is, TLG’s weapons ban has been inconsistently exercised; after all, “realistic” weapons from swords to submachine guns appear regularly across LEGO’s multiple product lines built around fantasy-themed violence. A different, perhaps more compelling rationale for TLG’s acquisition of Bricklink, and its ban both on non-LEGO products on the site (not just guns) and on products modelled after unlicenced media franchises, is to accomplish through infrastructural means what the company has been unable to do legally, since losing its suit against Canadian toymaker Mega Bloks: that is, to assert a monopoly over building toy systems by curtailing the capacity for either businesses or private individuals to incorporate non-LEGO products into their creations, whether commercial and non-commercial. Like other major media platforms, LEGO encourages connection, openness, and creativity – so long as we use its platform, and its platform exclusively, to do so. Here, we can mobilise a further notion of platform, which has attracted considerable scholarly attention in the last decade: understanding platforms as the economic engine of contemporary late-stage capitalism, with the “platformisation” of increasing sectors of the economy entailing the transformation of jobs and, perhaps as frequently, hobbies, into gig work (Nieborg and Poell; Vallas and Schor). Under these conditions, the platformisation of LEGO – facilitated, in part, by TLG’s acquisition of Bricklink – positions small businesses like BrickArms and Citizen Brick, not to mention the countless artists who work with LEGO, as platform workers. They are utterly dependent on access to LEGO, both in terms of the interoperability of their products and in terms of their ability to distribute their products to LEGO hobbyists and enthusiasts. Like other platform workers, their livelihoods are profoundly shaped by the regulatory regimes and policy shifts of corporate media giants. Conclusion: Infrastructural Instructions While subtle and arguably relatively contained in its effects, TLG’s operations regarding its acquisition and subsequent content moderation of Bricklink align it with other “platformised infrastructures” like Facebook, Twitter, and Steam: commercial-run systems of connection that purport to foster open, creative forms of production and exchange, while at the same time extending near-monopolistic control over those means of production and exchange (Plantin et al. 298). TLG wants us all to play nice, and very adroitly positions LEGO as the paradigmatic medium for children’s open exploratory play and, increasingly, for adults’ mindfulness and self-care. It has very clear ideas about what playing nice entails: no offensive content, nothing overtly harmful or hurtful, and a cheerful embrace of a sort of focus-grouped politics of progressive representation (Johnson). But playing nice also means, crucially, avoiding anything that is not LEGO. It is a notion of nice that is fundamentally commensurate with and concerned for LEGO’s virtual monopoly on recombinatory, material play. This is a monopoly which, while no longer legal, has been waged ideologically to great success, such that incorporating LEGO-compatible, non-LEGO-branded building bricks into one’s hobbyist builds or commercial aftermarket products is anathema to the AFOL community – those for whom Bricklink is their lifeblood (Taylor). With the acquisition of Bricklink, it is now a monopoly that can be exerted infrastructurally as well. For those who rely on Bricklink for their hobby, if not their livelihood, the message is clear: play by our rules, or don’t play at all. LEGO famously has a profoundly ambivalent relationship to instructions: instructions formalise and cement LEGO’s creative potentials, but also curtail them. By way of conclusion, we might consider how LEGO’s acquisition of Bricklink constitutes a set of infrastructural instructions: prescriptions not for how certain pieces can fit together to build certain things, but around what constitutes appropriate and acceptable uses of a product that ostensibly has limitless creative possibilities. This set of infrastructural prescriptions has less to do with LEGO’s moral stance as an arbiter and champion of creativity, problem-solving, and progressive education – that is, with its operations as a figurative and political platform – and more with LEGO’s monopolistic aspirations to be ‘the’ operating platform for materially digital creation.

We address this gap by examining the impact of supply chain concentration on integration and business performance with the consideration of the contingent role of environmental turbulence. Using archival and matched survey data from 1008 senior managers of 336 firms collected at two points in time, we find supplier concentration does not have a significant effect on supplier integration while customer concentration has a positive effect on customer integration. We also find market turbulence weakens the concentration-integration relationship for both supplier and customer sides while technological turbulence strengthens it. Supplier and customer integration have significantly positive effects on business performance.

This credit facility is in great demand by the public because it is very helpful, especially in terms of additional capital. However, this credit activity can also be full of risks because most of the funds are entrusted to the public. Therefore, the provision of credit must be accompanied by strict risk management. As time goes on after credit is realized, banks are faced with credit risk problems, namely bad credit. Conducting a 5C (Character, Capacity, Capital, Economic Condition, and Collateral) analysis of customers is one way for banks to reduce the risk of bad credit. In fact, even though anticipatory steps have been taken by applying the 5C analysis, there is still a risk of default due to the death of the debtor, which causes the loan to not be fully paid off. In response to the possibility of the foregoing, financial/banking institutions adopted a policy requiring debtors to obtain term life insurance for a period of time equal to the term of the loan. For this reason, banks usually cooperate with life insurance institutions. Therefore, it must be ensured that the net single premium is paid at the beginning of the credit loan. With regard to the above, this paper will provide an overview and also discuss the concept of calculating the net single premium on credit life insurance, especially for debtors who make loan transactions to banking institutions that apply loan repayments with the sinking fund concept with a period according to the loan repayment tenor.

Blue Bird Tbk is based on ratios consisting of the influence of profitability ratios (ROA, ROE), liquidity ratios (CR), solvency ratios (DAR) and activity ratios (TATO) to profits (Y). The research method used is descriptive research with a quantitative approach. The results of the study show that the financial situation of PT Blue Bird Tbk is currently in an unfavorable phase due to the presence of new competitors. Followed by the worst financial conditions in 2020 due to government regulations which harmed the company's sales and revenue. In 2021 this is a breath of fresh air for PT Blue Bird Tbk to continue to increase its sales. And based on the results of the analysis that we did, we estimate that in the absence of a pandemic condition and the absence of government regulations, PT Blue Bird Tbk's economy will continue to improve.",en

The conditions of operation of modern enterprises are given. The need to take into account constant changes in consumer interests and requests is substantiated. This can be done by comprehensive coverage of one's own activities for proper and effective functioning in market conditions.Examples of companies that have market success due to the use of marketing as a holistic business function that covers all its components at the same time are given. It is proven that their activity is based on a symbiosis of integrated marketing, internal marketing, relationship marketing and socially responsible marketing. Each component of the holistic concept of marketing is considered. It has been confirmed that in modern market conditions, holistic marketing is a quality tool for conducting effective marketing activities of companies. Methodical principles of using various marketing tools for evaluating each component of holistic marketing are proposed. Approaches to evaluating the development of long-term trust relations of the enterprise with partners and consumers are presented.

We use data from 742 product markets globally, distinguishing the US and European markets, for the years 2003-2018. The estimation results based on the difference-in-differences estimation suggest that the technology giants’ buyouts subsequently reduced market entry rates and decreased available venture capital funding in the target product markets of tech giants’ acquisitions. In other words, the acquisitions of technology giants seem to generate the so-called kill zone effect. Our empirical analysis further suggests that this effect was strengthened during the 2010s when large technology companies gained increasing access to user data. Furthermore, we find that technology giants’ acquisitions of platform companies have decreased market entry in non-platform markets. In the US, unlike in the EU area, also available venture capital financing has declined in such non-platform markets from which technology giants have acquired companies.",en

This policy requires audit firms to raise the sum of the cumulative compensation limit of their PII and PRF from 6 million to 80 million yuan. It is found, first, that the capital market regards this policy revision as a signal to strengthen investor protection and responds positively; client firms with high audit risks have a stronger response. Second, auditors’ governance of financial information has strengthened, resulting in the significant improvement of their clients’ financial reporting quality, with a stronger effect on firms with higher earnings management risk. There is no evidence that audit firms pass the costs on to their clients. Finally, the mismatch between auditors and new client firms is alleviated. We show that in an emerging market with weak investor protection, establishing a sound risk-preparedness mechanism for audit firms and strengthening the capacity for civil compensation ex post greatly improve the adaptive degree between international auditing standards and the legal environment of China, thereby enhancing the overall service quality of the audit market.",en

The key idea of the modification of this algorithm is the strategy of right-hand traversal when passing the graph in depth. The vertex with the minimum coordinate on the OY axis is assigned as the starting vertex in the right-hand traversal. The exit from the initial vertex is performed along the edge with the minimum polar angle. The continuation of the traversal from each next vertex is carried out along an edge with a minimum polar angle relative to the edge along which arrived at the current vertex. A two-level structure of nested cycles is introduced. This is the main level and the zero level of nesting. All cycles of the basis belong to the main level. Each of the cycles can additionally have a zero level of nesting in another main cycle for it, if it is nested in the main cycle and not nested in any other cycle from the main cycle. With the right-hand traversal, zero nesting cycles are adjacent to the main cycle and do not have common vertices outside the main cycle. These two properties allowed in each basis cycle sequentially select and exclude from it all its zero nesting cycles, using the symmetric difference operation. It is shown that the rest of the basic cycle is the cycle of the block map cell. The complexity of each step of the proposed algorithm does not exceed the quadratic complexity with respect to the number of vertices of the simple planar graph.",en

These generic unfolding depend on one real parameter. The classification is done by assigning to each such germ a weak and a strong modulus, which are unfoldings of the modulus assigned to the antiholomorphic parabolic point. The weak and the strong moduli are unfoldings of the Ecalle-Voronin modulus of the second iterate of the germ which is a real unfolding of a holomorphic parabolic point. A preparation of the unfolding allows to identify one real analytic canonical parameter and any conjugacy between two prepared generic unfoldings preserves the canonical parameter. We also solve the realisation problem by giving necessary and sufficient conditions for a strong modulus to be realized. This is done simultaneously with solving the probem of the existence of an antiholomorphic square root to a germ of generic analytic unfolding of a holomorphic parabolic germ.

Let $\mathbb{K}$ be a field and $p(t)\in\mathbb{K}[t]$ be an irreducible polynomial. This paper deals with the analogue of this conjecture over the field of formal Laurent series over $\mathbb{K}$, known as the $p(t)$-adic Littlewood Conjecture ($p(t)$-LC). The following results are established: (1) Any counterexample to $p(t)$-LC for the case $p(t)=t$ generates a counterexample when $p(t)$ is any irreducible polynomial. Since Adiceam, Nesharim and Lunnon proved the $p(t)$-LC is false when $p(t)=t$ and $\mathbb{K}$ has characteristic three, one obtains a disproof of the $p(t)$-LC over any such field for any choice of irreducible polynomial $p(t)$. (2) A Khintchine-type theorem for $p(t)$-adic multiplicative approximation is established, enabling one to determine the measure of the set of counterexamples to $p(t)$-LC with an additional monotonic growth function. (3) The Hausdorff dimension of the same set is shown to be maximal when $p(t)=t$ in the critical case where the growth function is $\log^2$. These goals are achieved by developing an extensive theory in combinatorics relating $p(t)$-LC to the properties of the so-called number wall of a sequence. This is an infinite array containing the determinant of every finite Toeplitz matrix generated by that sequence. The main novelty of this paper is creating a dictionary allowing one to transfer statements in Diophantine approximation in positive characteristic to combinatorics through the concept of a number wall, and conversely.",en

But in math, conventional wisdom says that it is completely hopeless due to the arbitrarily high complexity of realization spaces of oriented matroids. In this paper, we nonetheless find a path forward. We present a Lie-theoretic realization of color factors for color-dressed generalized biadjoint scalar amplitudes, formulated in terms of certain tilings of the real moduli space $X(k,n)$ and collections of logarithmic differential forms, resolving an important open question from recent work by Cachazo, Early and Zhang. The main idea is to replace the realization space decomposition of $X(k,n)$ with a large class of overlapping tilings whose topologies are individually relatively simple. So we obtain a collection of color-dressed amplitudes, each of which satisfies $U(1)$ decoupling separately. The essential complexity appears when they are all superposed.",en

For example, given an unrestricted Brownian motion one can construct reflecting, elastic, killed, and stopped Brownian motions. On the other hand, from the functional-analytic point of view, the semigroups that describe these new processes seem to need to be obtained independently, using the Hille–Yosida theorem. The aim of this article is to show that this is not necessary; all these semigroups are hidden in the unrestricted Brownian motion semigroup as its subspace semigroups. In other words, in the semigroup theory, subspace semigroups play the role of a number of advanced techniques of stochastic analysis.To exemplify this, we exhibit a number of invariant subspaces for the unrestricted Brownian motion semigroup, construct the corresponding semigroups and show how they are related to the semigroups describing Brownian motions on the half-line with various types of boundary behavior at $ x = 0 $, including the Brownian motions named above.

Since each x-point originating from the domain corresponds to two y-points on the graph of a closed curve (i.e., circle, ellipse, superellipse, or ovoid) in a rectangular (Cartesian) diagram, it does not fulfil the function’s requirements. This non-function phenomenon obstructs the nonlinear regression application for fitting observed data resembling a closed curve; thus, it requires transforming the rectangular coordinate system into a polar coordinate system. This study discusses nonlinear regression to fit the circumference of a tree stem’s cross-section and its sapwood–heartwood transition by transforming rectangular coordinates (x, y) of the observed data points’ positions into polar coordinates (r, θ). Following a polar coordinate model, circular curve fitting fits a log’s cross-sectional shape and sapwood–heartwood transition. Ellipse models result in better goodness of fit than circular ones, while the rotated ellipse is the best-fit one. Deviation from the circular shape indicates environmental effects on vascular cambium differentiation. Foresters have good choices: (1) continuing using the circular model as the simplest one or (2) changing to the rotated ellipse model because it gives the best fit to estimate a tree stem’s cross-sectional shape; therefore, it is more reliable to determine basal area, tree volume, and tree trunk biomass. Computer modelling transforms the best-fit model’s formulas of the rotated ellipse using Python scripts provided by Wolfram engine libraries.",en

We study an alternative paired-domination version of the domination game played on a graph G by two players, named Dominator and Staller. The players take turns choosing a pair of adjacent vertices of G such that neither vertex in the pair has yet been chosen and the vertices in the pair must dominate at least one vertex not dominated by the previously chosen vertices. This process eventually produces a paired-dominating set of vertices of G; that is, a dominating set in G that induces a subgraph that contains a perfect matching. Dominator wishes to minimize the number of vertices chosen, while Staller wishes to maximize it. The game paired-domination number γgpr(G) of G is the number of vertices chosen when Dominator starts the game and both players play optimally, and the Staller-start game paired-domination number γgpr′(G) of G is the number of vertices chosen when Staller starts the game and both players play optimally.

Duality theorems for backward and forward projections are established under mild conditions, which lay a foundation for investigating sampling of measures in stochastic orders. To demonstrate applications of these theorems beyond practice, particular attention is given to mathematical properties of convex order and subharmonic order. While backward and forward cones possess distinct geometric properties, strong connections between backward and forward projections can be obtained in the convex order case. Compared with convex order, the study of subharmonic order is subtler, particularly the existence and regularity of optimal mappings. In all cases, Brenier-Strassen type polar factorization theorems are proved, thus providing a full picture of the decomposition of optimal couplings between probability measures given by deterministic contractions (resp. expansions) and stochastic couplings. The factorization of convex order projection completes the decomposition obtained by Gozlan and Juillet, which builds a connection with Caffarelli's contraction theorem. A further noteworthy addition to earlier results is the decomposition in the subharmonic order case where the optimal mappings are characterized by volume distortion properties.

In an article, ""Polynomials as Polygons"" in Math Intelligencer 2017, Tabachinikov rivisits an anonymous paper subsequent toLill's original paper, and explores a graphical approach for identifying the imaginary roots. Guided by the above articles and Horner's method, we naturally consider a polynomial with complex coefficients as a polygonal line in the Argand--Gauss plane and a root of the equation as a string of similar triangles ``reflecting"" on the segments of the line, thereby unifying the seemingly disparate geometrical approaches to real and imaginary roots. We also examine the factorization of polynomials and the multiplicity of roots from a graphical viewpoint. For instance, a repeated root of a real cubic equation is a tri-tangent line to a certain three-parabola. This refines the well known classic result of Beloch. In the final section, we discuss a method for identifying real quadratic factors of real polynomicals.",en

The condition for testing the hypothesis of normality for a set of small independent samples is the presence of a sufficient number of them with the same volume. In this case, it is possible to test the hypothesis of the normality of the general aggregates from which the studied samples were taken, assuming that the parameters of these aggregates have different values. When testing the hypothesis of normality for a large number of small samples, only one value of the first, second, etc. measurements is randomly selected from each sample, thereby allowing simplification and random selection of data. The object of this study is small samples of the falling number of oat flour used in bakery production in the development of bakery products. The purpose of this work was to test the hypothesis of normality for small samples of the experiment using the nonparametric criterion of agreement ω2 of the smallest of each of the four definitions of the incidence number, since rounding the values of direct measurements excludes the random nature of the quantity or its normal distribution in favor of a uniform one. It was found that at a significance level of p = 0?05, the table value (nω2)1-p is greater than the calculated value of nω2 for all four definitions, hence the hypothesis of the normal distribution of small samples for all four definitions (as random variables) of the falling number of oatmeal does not deviate. The results obtained in this work are consistent with the generally accepted classical concepts of testing the statistical hypothesis of the normal distribution of samples. The statistical method provides sufficient accuracy of the studied indicator in technical systems and does not require the synthesis of a statistical criterion to test the hypothesis of the normality of small sample.",en

As this constraint nicely forms a so-called symplectic Stiefel manifold, Riemannian optimization is preferred, because one can borrow ideas from unconstrained optimization methods after preparing necessary geometric tools. Retraction is arguably the most important one which decides the way iterates are updated given a search direction. Two retractions have been constructed so far: one relies on the Cayley transform and the other is designed using quasi-geodesic curves. In this paper, we propose a new retraction which is based on an SR matrix decomposition. We prove that its domain contains the open unit ball which is essential in proving the global convergence of the associated gradient-based optimization algorithm. Moreover, we consider three applications—symplectic target matrix problem, symplectic eigenvalue computation, and symplectic model reduction of Hamiltonian systems—with various examples.

https://openalex.org/W4307643812,2023,Mathematics,"Uncertainty in the Back-Calculation of Geometric Parameters of Vertical Curves Obtained with UAVIn existing roads, the geometrical parameters of the alignment are the primary input for safety or geometrical improvement studies. However, the as-built drawings are not always available to obtain geometrical parameters, whereby they must be back-calculated from surveying data. The procedures to back-calculate geometrical parameters of existing roads and fit profile data use parametric methods such as polynomials or explicit functions and nonparametric methods such as splines or smoothers. In smoother-based methods, a usual computing decision is to consider a fixed spacing, one smoothing algorithm, and one set of smoothing parameters to obtain a single set of curvature, deflection, and length (KAL) parameters of vertical curves. Therefore, different values of KAL parameters will be obtained depending on the choice of spacing, smoothing algorithm, and smoothing parameters. This paper aims to study the relative effect in the variability of KAL parameters of a vertical curve, introduced by several spacing combinations, smoothers, and parameters, using data obtained with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Elevation and slope data were obtained from a digital elevation model every 2, 5, and 10 m. The slope-horizontal distance diagrams were smoothed using single, double, and triple exponential smoothing for different levels, trends, and season parameters. The KAL parameters were back-calculated for each slope-horizontal distance diagram, and the variability analysis was undertaken with boosting regression, multiple analysis of variance, and k-nearest neighbor algorithm and tested using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. Results show that the smoothing algorithm and parameters choice affected mainly the K parameter and that the single exponential smoothing algorithm is more suitable than double and triple exponential smoothing algorithms to estimate the KAL parameters.",en

We show that their prolongation with the corresponding signature is an affine and polynomial process taking values in subsets of group-like elements of the extended tensor algebra. By relying on the duality theory for affine and polynomial processes we obtain explicit formulas in terms of novel and proper notions of converging power series for the Fourier-Laplace transform and the expected value of entire functions of the signature process. The coefficients of these power series are solutions of extended tensor algebra valued Riccati and linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), respectively, whose vector fields can be expressed in terms of the entire characteristics of the corresponding SDEs. In other words, we construct a class of stochastic processes, which is universal within It\^o processes with path-dependent characteristics and which allows for a relatively explicit characterization of the Fourier-Laplace transform and hence the full law on path space. We also analyze the special case of one-dimensional signature SDEs, which correspond to classical SDEs with real-analytic characteristics.

The orbital periods of systems are corrected using photometric observations. Results obtained from light curves morphology related to accretion region are discussed for each system. V388 Peg shows a higher amplitude (∼1.6 mag) of orbital modulation and smooth structure in T100 optical observations.

Additionally, this information is critical for understanding how a coronal mass ejection (CME) interacts with the solar wind during its propagation. We present the Mostly Empirical Operation Wind with a High Speed Stream (MEOW-HiSS) model, which runs nearly instantaneously. This model is derived from MHD simulations of an idealized HSS emanating from a circular coronal hole (CH). We split the MHD HSS radial profiles into small regions well-described by simple functions (e.g. flat, linear, exponential, sinusoidal) that can be constrained using the MHD values. We then determine how the region boundaries and the constraining values change with CH area and the distance of the HSS front. MEOW-HiSS requires the CH area and front distance and produces the corresponding radial profile with an error less than 10\% for most parameters. MEOW-HiSS produces profiles at subsequent times with almost no loss in accuracy. We also compare MEOW-HiSS results to four HSS observed in situ at 1 au. We present a method for determining MEOW-HiSS inputs from EUV images and use these values to hindcast the observed cases.

In addition to GC presence appearing stochastic and difficult to describe with average trends, in the smallest satellite galaxies GCs contribute a substantial fraction of total stellar mass. We investigate the stochasticity and number of GCs in dwarf galaxies using an updated version of our model that links the formation of GCs to the growth of the host galaxy mass. We find that more than 50% of dwarf galaxies with stellar mass $M_\odot\lesssim 2\times10^7 M_\odot$ do not host GCs, whereas dwarfs with $M_\odot\sim10^8 M_\odot$ almost always contain some GCs, with a median number $\sim 10$ at $z=0$. These predictions are in agreement with the observations of the Local Volume dwarfs. We also confirm the near-linear GC system mass--halo mass relation down to $M_{\rm h}\simeq10^8 M_\odot$ under the assumption that GC formation and evolution in galaxies of all mass can be described by the same physical model. A detailed case study of two model dwarfs that resemble the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy shows that observational samples can be notably biased by incompleteness below detection limit and at large radii.",en

The change in viscosity leads to different microenvironments governed by viscous effects-mediated hydrodynamics. For example, different bubble size distributions are dispersed inside a bioreactor due to viscous effects. Traditionally, the mathematical modeling framework used in numerical simulation of the bubble size distribution in (bio)reactors is based on breakup and coalescence models valid only in the inertial subrange of turbulence. Hence, applying the traditional models for breakup and coalescence in viscous fluids can result in inaccurate model predictions because the dissipation subrange of turbulence is not considered. This work focuses on the numerical prediction of the bubble size in a stirred bioreactor using the concept of the complete energy spectrum of turbulence to enable viscous effects in the breakup and coalescence models. The breakup and coalescence models are used within the population balance equation (PBE), coupled with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The emphasis of the PBE-CFD simulations is placed on gas–liquid hydrodynamics aspects related to viscous Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids applications. In bioreactor zones where viscosity effects occur, the use of the complete energy spectrum of turbulence facilitates the calculation of the transition between dissipation and inertial subranges of turbulence. It is shown that the numerical simulations captured viscous effects-mediated hydrodynamics. Considering these findings, using the complete energy spectrum of turbulence in PBE-CFD simulations is a promising approach for numerical bubble size prediction.",en

Using a Drinfeld twist, we deformed spacetime symmetries, algebra of vector fields and differential forms, leading to a formulation of noncommutative Einstein equations. We studied a concrete example of charged BTZ spacetime and deformations steaming from the so-called angular twist. The entropy of the noncommutative charged BTZ black hole was obtained using the brick-wall method. We used a charged scalar field as a probe and obtained its spectrum and density of states via WKB approximation. We provide the method used to calculate corrections to the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy in higher orders in WKB, but we present the final result in the lowest WKB order.

With insightful identification of the former with kinetic and the latter with potential energy, it has been recently argued that the equilibrium of a Buchdahl star may be governed by the Virial theorem.

https://openalex.org/W4387187872,2023,Physics,"Evaluation of Various Turbulence Models and Large Eddy Simulation for Stall Prediction in a Centrifugal PumpRotational stall is an unstable flow phenomenon that reduces the performance of centrifugal pumps, usually occurring under partial load conditions. It causes instability in the flow resulting in intense vibrations and noise under certain flow conditions. In this study, the one-equation Wray–Agarwal (WA) turbulence model, which was recently developed, is employed to numerically simulate the internal flow field of a centrifugal pump under the deep stall condition. The aim of this study is to examine the prediction accuracy for stall by using the WA turbulence model. The method based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been widely applied for investigation of complex flow patterns in pumps by solving Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) experimental results were compared with simulations predicted using the WA, renormalization group (RNG) k−ε, shear stress transport (SST) k−ω, and realizable k−ε turbulence models and large eddy simulations (LES). The comparisons indicated that the WA turbulence model can accurately predict the flow separation and has a good agreement with the PIV data. The WA model adds a cross-diffusion term and a blending function to the eddy viscosity R equation, so that this model could be expressed as a one-equation k−ω model or one-equation k−ε model as needed by using the switching function. The results show the strong potential of the WA model for accurately computing the stall in rotating fluid machinery. The outcomes of the study are useful in development and optimization of fluid machinery with a low calculation cost and a high accuracy.",en

In the second method, we study the probability of a spin-flip of a particle when it is transmitted through a potential barrier including a spatially rotating field interacting with its spin. According to the adiabatic theorem, the probability depends on the velocity of the particle inside the barrier. It is numerically observed that the probability increases for higher barriers, which is consistent with the result obtained by the Larmor clock. By comparing outcomes for different initial spin states, we suggest that one of the main causes of the apparent decrease in the tunneling time can be the filtering effect occurring at the end of the barrier.",en

Typically, in the aftermath of such transitions, one of the two possible broken symmetry states is emergent. However, synthetic systems and those formed under non-equilibrium conditions may exhibit metastable states comprising of both left (L) and right (R) handed symmetry. Here we explore the formation of chiral charge-density wave (CDW) domains after a laser quench in 1T-TaS2 with scanning tunneling microscopy. Typically, we observed transient domains of both chiralities, separated spatially from each other by domain walls with different structure. In addition, we observe transient density of states modulations consistent with interference of L and R-handed charge density waves within the surface monolayer. Theoretical modeling of the intertwined domain structures using a classical charged lattice gas model reproduces the experimental domain wall structures. The superposition (S) state cannot be understood classically within the correlated electron model but is found to be consistent with interferences of L and R -handed charge-density waves within domains, confined by surrounding domain walls, vividly revealing for the first time an interference of Fermi electrons with opposite chirality in charge density wave systems.",en

The optically red to near infra-red emission (`red' component) of AT2017gfo was readily explained as produced by the decay of newly created nuclei produced by rapid neutron capture (a kilonova). However, the ultra-violet to optically blue emission (`blue' component) that was dominant at early times (up to 1.5 days) received no consensus regarding its driving physics. Among many explanations, two leading contenders are kilonova radiation from a lanthanide-poor ejecta component or shock interaction (cocoon emission). In this work, we simulate AT2017gfo-like light curves and perform a Bayesian analysis to study whether an ultra-violet satellite capable of rapid gravitational wave follow-up, could distinguish between physical processes driving the early `blue' component. We find that a Dorado-like ultra-violet satellite, with a 50 sq. deg. field of view and a limiting magnitude (AB) of 20.5 for a 10 minute exposure is able to distinguish radiation components up to at least 160 Mpc if data collection starts within 3.2 or 5.2 hours for two possible AT2017gfo-like light curve scenarios. We also study the degree to which parameters can be constrained with the obtained photometry. We find that, while ultra-violet data alone constrains parameters governing the outer ejecta properties, the combination of both ground-based optical and space-based ultra-violet data allows for tight constraints for all but one parameter of the kilonova model up to 160 Mpc. These results imply that an ultra-violet mission like Dorado would provide unique insights into the early evolution of the post-merger system and its driving emission physics.",en

The experiments were conducted in a tube bundle test section composed of 20 rows of 4 tubes with 20 mm O.D. arranged in a normal triangular configuration with a transversal pitch per diameter ratio of 1.25. The experiments were conducted under single-phase flows with Reynolds numbers ranging from 210 to 19560, comprising transitional and turbulent flow regimes. The vector velocity fields were obtained through the Spatial Filter Velocimetry (SFV) technique, resulting in maximum spatial and temporal resolutions of 2.1 samples/mm and 49.6 kHz, respectively. The velocity measurements obtained through SFV enabled the analysis of the flow development, the vector velocity field, the flow turbulence, the velocity fluctuation along the time, and the effects of the mechanism of momentum transport on the pressure gradient. The obtained results indicate that the flow separation and the repeated intersection of opposite flows are the most relevant sources of turbulence. Moreover, the analysis of the terms of the RANS equations reveals that the convective terms are the most relevant terms for the pressure gradient.",en

Therefore, the rotational wave properties of protons or nucleons, which should be comparable to De Broglie matter waves, have never been attributed to a wavelength, frequency or energy, but solely to their spin, which is a quantized property and probably does not reflect the true angular momentum as the product of radius and rotational impulse of a particle. Using data that originates from the hadron accelerator CERN in Switzerland, the true, not quantized velocity of the rotational wave of protons could be, however, measured. Thereby, its frequency is 2072.18 Hz, hence, it is unexpectedly low. The spike in the polarizability curve of protons at Q^2 = 0.33 GeV^2, published currently in the journal Nature, together with the rotational wave frequency obtained from CERN data, provides reliable evidence that this might be an interference in terms of superposition of the particle wave of the scattered electrons with the rotational wave of the protons at the same energy level, doubling the expected curve value, which, since there are no other possible explanations, proves the determined rotating wave velocity of protons.",en

The Theory of ""Gravilon or Spacetime Particles"" as an Explanation for Gravity and Light using The Same Particles and Light Speed Limit. Explanation for Dark Matter, Dark Energy and Mass. Explanation for Why Small Particles Follow Quantum Mechanics but Larger Particles Follow the Einstein Relativity with Resolution of Black Holes Singularity The Theory of ""Gravilon or Spacetime Particles"" as an Explanation for Gravity and Light using The Same Particles and Light Speed Limit…There has always been a question about what transmits electromagnetic waves and/or gravitational forces. Furthermore, the nature of dark matter and dark energy remains elusive. This paper is introducing a new simple theory that may explain many unexplained phenomena in physics. This theory should stimulate many physicists and mathematicians for a new way of thinking about our universe and unsolved mysteries in physics. In this theory, the presence of new particles in the universe called ""Spacetime or Gravilon (Gravi for gravity and L for light and on for transmission)"", are proposed as the replacement for the space time fabric / field described by Einstein. The fact that gravity and light have the same speed for their propagation can be explained by the presence of Spacetime particles as they utilize the same vehicle (Spacetime particles) for their effect. The presence of Spacetime particles in the universe may explain the unknown phenomena called dark matter. The maximal possible contraction of time particles between space particles can explain why light or any matter cannot surpass the maximal speed of light and why time nearly stops with the light speed. These particles are simplified in this paper but are most likely complicated structures that could have more dimensions than the known four dimensional space time and could be very diverse in nature with multiple subunits than simple illustration in this paper. However, in the core, these particles are made from two fundamental parts. One part contains space particles connected to each other via other part time particles. Time particles could have particle quality but could also be pure energy. Basically, these Gravilon particles introduced in this paper have two major components. One is space and the other one is time. Space particles connected to the time particles could explain Spacetime effect known in the relativity theory. The main difference between this theory and the Einstein relativity, is the fact that this theory is introducing Spacetime particles instead of Space-time fabric. Connection of space with time particles can also explain relativity. Furthermore, interaction of these particles with matter can give matters their masses as an explanation for why matter has mass. Higgs bosons and fields could be also a part of Spacetime particles. This simple theory could also explain limitations of light speed and why light and gravity have the same speed for their effect. Furthermore, probably the distance between Spacetime particles can be stretched or contracted to fit small propagating particles in between based on their sizes. However, these stretching, and contraction properties should have limits. Those particles that can fit between the Spacetime particles before reaching the maximal stretching capability of Spacetime particles will behave mostly as quanta following quantum mechanics rules. Once propagating particles are too",en

Based on those parameters, we discussed the relationship between the mid-IR and the TeV bands and that between the mid-IR and the GeV bands. Main conclusions are drawn as follows: (1) In the color–color and color–magnitude diagrams, our sample forms a WISE-Gamma Strip in the [3.4]–[4.6]–[12] μ m color–color diagram, and TBLs occupy the brighter region than the non-TBLs for the similar color-index in the color-magnititue diagram; (2) The mid-IR luminosity of the TBLs is on average higher than that of non-TBLs, while the average mid-IR spectral index of TBLs is smaller than the non-TBLs, suggesting that TBLs are brighter and hold a more flat spectrum than do the non-TBLs in the mid-IR band. Besides, HBLs have a more flat mid-IR spectrum than LBLs and IBLs; (3) The mid-IR luminosity is positively correlated with the GeV luminosity and the intrinsic TeV luminosity. A positive correlation exists between the mid-IR spectral index and the observed TeV spectral index, which is consistent with the expectations of the synchrotron self-Compton mechanism.

If the angle parametrizing such a rotation is dependent on the photon's direction, then this phenomenon is called Anisotropic Cosmic Birefringence (ACB). In this paper, we perform for the first time a tomographic treatment of the ACB, by considering photons emitted both at the recombination and reionization epoch. This allows one to extract additional and complementary information about the physical source of cosmic birefringence with respect to the isotropic case. We focus here on the case of an axion-like field χ, whose coupling with the electromagnetic sector induces such a phenomenon, by using an analytical and numerical approach (which involves a modification of the CLASS code). We find that the anisotropic component of cosmic birefringence exhibits a peculiar behavior: an increase of the axion mass implies an enhancement of the anisotropic amplitude, allowing to probe a wider range of masses with respect to the purely isotropic case. Moreover, we show that at large angular scales, the interplay between the reionization and recombination contributions to ACB is sensitive to the axion mass, so that at sufficiently low multipoles, for sufficiently light masses, the reionization contribution overtakes the recombination one, making the tomographic approach to cosmic birefringence a promising tool for investigating the properties of this axion-like field.",en

The antiparallel CISP in an analytical form, obtained for constant momentum relaxation time in the limit of large Fermi energy, exhibits factor‐two increase with increasing the interlayer‐tunneling strength. This increase originates from the correction (to the semiclassical CISP) created by the subband mixing due to the momentum dependence of the Rashba effective magnetic field. The present interlayer‐coupling dependence of the antiparallel CISP is successfully explained as the layer‐pseudospin Hanle effect in which the spin in the original Hanle effect is replaced by the layer pseudospin. The present finding suggests that the correction by band mixing can be significant in the transport properties of various systems with the momentum‐dependent effective magnetic field.",en

Currently, optical lattices of diverse kinds have been introduced to the stabilization of light bullets, while the investigation for the light bullets of gap type -- nonlinear localized modes within the finite gap of the underlying linear Bloch spectrum -- is lacking. Herein, we address the formation and stabilization properties of such light gap bullets in periodic media with defocusing nonlinearity, theoretically and in numerical ways. The periodic media are based on two-dimensional periodic standing waves created in a coherent three-level atomic system which is driven to the regime of electromagnetically induced transparency, which in principle can also be replaced by photonic crystals in optics or optical lattices in ground-state ultracold atoms system. The temporal dispersion term is tuned to normal (positive) group velocity dispersion so that to launch the light gap bullets under self-repulsive nonlinearity; two types of such light gap bullets constructed as 3D gap solitons and vortices with topological charge m=1 within the first finite gap are reported and found to be robustly stable in the existence domains. On account of the light bullets were previously limited to the semi-infinite gap of periodic media and continuous nonlinear physical systems, the light gap bullets reported here thus supplement the missing type of three-dimensional spatiotemporal localized modes in periodic media which exhibit finite band gaps.",en
https://openalex.org/W4324144167,2023,Physics,"Separating large-scale superposition and modulation in turbulent channelsThe presence of very-large-scale motions in wall-bounded turbulent flows is commonly associated with their footprint in the form of the superposition of the large scales at the wall and the additional amplitude modulation of small-scale near-wall turbulence. These two phenomena are currently understood to be interlinked, with the superposed large-scale velocity gradient causing the modulation of small-scale activity in the proximity of the wall. To challenge this idea, we devise a numerical strategy that selectively suppresses either superposition or amplitude modulation, in an effort to isolate and study the remaining phenomenon. Results from our direct numerical simulations indicate that a positive correlation between the amplitude of the small scales in the near-wall region and the large-scale signal in the outer flow persists even when near-wall large-scale motions are suppressed – i.e. in absence of superposition. Clearly, this kind of correlation cannot be caused by the near-wall large-scale velocity or its gradients, as both are absent. Conversely, when modulation is blocked, the near-wall footprints of the large scales seem to disappear. This study has been carried out on channel flows at friction Reynolds number $Re_\tau =1000$ in both standard simulation domains and minimal streamwise units (MSUs), where the streamwise fluctuation energy is enhanced. The consistency of the results obtained by the two approaches suggests that MSUs can capture correctly this kind of scale interaction at a much reduced cost.",en
https://openalex.org/W4378530708,2023,Physics,"Upper part-load instability in a reduced-scale Francis turbine: an experimental studyAbstract Francis turbines with medium or high specific speeds may experience a particular type of instability in the upper part load in which the precessing vortex has an elliptical shape. The occurrence of the upper part-load instability (UPLI) is accompanied by large-amplitude pressure fluctuations at a distinct frequency between 2 and 4 times the runner rotational speed. This paper experimentally investigates UPLI for a reduced-scale Francis turbine. To investigate the causal factors of this instability, draft tube pressure measurements, particle image velocimetry, and high-speed flow visualizations have been performed at several operating points under cavitation and cavitation-free conditions . It is shown for the first time that for an operating point within the UPLI range, the vortex always features a circular section in cavitation-free conditions, which is preserved even after the initial appearance of cavitation. It is only below a certain Thoma number that the vortex section turns into an ellipse and shows an abrupt increase in pressure fluctuations. Analysis of the phase-averaged velocity fields reveals that a concentrated vortex with a large precession radius is a prerequisite for UPLI, while the instantaneous velocity fields clearly illustrate the asymmetric velocity distribution around the elliptical vortex. The existence of a breathing mode and the intermittent formation of two side vortices along the elliptical vortex rope are also evidenced by high-speed flow visualizations. These results provide a much deeper insight into the flow structures that favor the development of UPLI and help delimit its thresholds to higher precision, and thus, prevent its occurrence during turbine operations.",en

Our starting point is the formulation of an original hypothesis about particles, compatible with the basic assumptions of the Standard Model (SM): a massive particle is a geometric structure of a set of elastically coupled quantum oscillators that propagates along a line of a non-massive base field (in impulse eigenstate). We show that the propagation equation of an oscillation associated with the geometric shape representing an electron propagates following Dirac’s wave equation.

To follow the GRB221009A propagation through the heliosphere, we used the electron and proton flux measurements from solar missions Solar Orbiter and STEREO-A; Earth’s magnetosphere and solar wind missions THEMIS and Wind; meteorological satellites POES15, POES19, and MetOp3; and MAVEN—a NASA mission orbiting Mars. GRB221009A had a structure of four bursts: the less intense Pulse 1—the triggering impulse—was detected by gamma-ray observatories at T 0 = 13:16:59 UT (near the Earth); the most intense Pulses 2 and 3 were detected on board all the spacecraft from the list; and Pulse 4 was detected in more than 500 s after Pulse 1. Due to their different scientific objectives, the spacecraft, whose data were used in this study, were separated by more than 1 au (Solar Orbiter and MAVEN). This enabled the tracking of GRB221009A as it was propagating across the heliosphere. STEREO-A was the first to register Pulse 2 and 3 of the GRB, almost 100 s before their detection by spacecraft in the vicinity of Earth. MAVEN detected GRB221009A Pulses 2, 3, and 4 at the orbit of Mars about 237 s after their detection near Earth.

This process, known as solar modulation, introduces a time variation in the cosmic ray fluxes measured near Earth for rigidities up to a few tens of GV. In twelve years of operation, AMS has measured the temporal structures of fluxes of elementary particles and light nuclei up to Oxygen over an eleven-year solar cycle. The detailed time dependence measurements of these fluxes reveal variations on different time scales and rigidities associated to the solar activity. This extensive set of continuous measurements performed by a single detector over a long time period provides valuable information about both the mass and charge sign dependencies of the solar modulation of cosmic rays. Thanks to its large acceptance, identification capabilities and long-term mission in space, AMS is a unique experiment to carry out precise studies on the time variability of the individual species in cosmic rays.

To explore this possibility, we utilized numerical Lanczos and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods to calculate concurrence, quantum discord (QD), and entanglement entropy. The results of our study indicate the existence of quantum entanglement within the intermediate region, implying a greater probability for the dominance of the quantum spin-liquid (QSL) phase over the antiferromagnetic Ising order.

The envelope inflation structure (EIS) caused by the radiation luminosity being close to the Eddington luminosity in the iron opacity peak region of H-free WR stars may be the key to resolve the radius problem of H-free WR stars. We try to explain the H-free WR stars observed in the Milk Way (MW) and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) by the He stars. Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics code, we compute the evolution of He stars with and without MLT++ prescriptions and discuss their effects on the EIS. We have calculated the evolution of He stars using a new mass-loss rate formula and three different relative rotational velocity and compared our results with observations on Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams. The low luminosity (log$(L/L_{{\odot}})\leq5.2$) H-free WR stars in the MW and the LMC can be explained by the helium giant phase in low-mass He stars, the high $X_{C}$ and $X_{O}$ in WC stars can only evolve through low-mass He stars with a rapid rotation. High-mass He stars with the EIS can explain H-free WR stars with a luminosity exceeding $10^{5.7} L_{{\odot}}$ and an effective temperature above $10^{4.7}$ K in the MW. They can also explain H-free WR stars on the right-hand side of the He zero-age main sequence in the LMC. High-mass stars with the EIS evolve into WO stars at the final evolution stage, and the shorter lifetime fraction is consistent with the small number of observed WO stars.",en

Precise radial velocities ($\sigma_{\rm{RV}} < 2$ km s$^{-1}$) and metallicities ($\sigma_{\rm{[Fe/H]}} < 0.2$ dex) confirm their memberships of UMi. Detailed analysis of the brightest and outermost star (Target~1, at $\sim12$ r$_h$), yields precision chemical abundances for the $\alpha$- (Mg, Ca, Ti), odd-Z (Na, K, Sc), Fe-peak (Fe, Ni, Cr), and neutron-capture (Ba) elements. With data from the literature and APOGEE DR17, we find the chemical patterns in UMi are consistent with an outside-in star formation history that includes yields from core collapse supernovae, asymptotic giant branch stars, and supernovae Ia. Evidence for a knee in the [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios near [Fe/H] $\sim-2.1$ indicates a low star formation efficiency similar to that in other dwarf galaxies.

Various models&amp;#160; (Alexeev et al. 1998, Borovsky 2013, Trattner et al. 2007, etc) predicting the position of the X-line have been proposed. These models often rely on quantities whose global spatial distributions at the magnetopause are typically obtained through numerical simulations. In this study, we attempt to reconstruct these global distributions using only in-situ measurements. To do this, we have used statistical learning to automatically select in-situ data from four missions (Cluster, Doublestar, THEMIS, MMS). The 3D reconstruction of the magnetic field draping in the dayside magnetosheath (Michotte de Welle et al. 2022) reveals significant differences with the model of Kobel et Fluckiger 1994 for a certain range of IMF orientations. As this magnetostatic model is frequently used to predict magnetic shear at the magnetopause, we will examine the implications of these differences on the X-lines maximizing this quantity (Trattner et al. 2007). We will also extend this discussion to other relevant quantities such as current density and the Cassak-Shay reconnection rate, which can also be accessed using in-situ measurements.",en

We use two approaches: i) We calculate high-$p_\perp$ $R_{AA}$ and flow coefficients $v_2$, $v_3$ and $v_4$ assuming different $(\eta/s)(T)$ of the fluid-dynamically evolving medium. ii) We calculate the quenching strength ($\hat{q}/T^3$) from our dynamical energy loss model and convert it to $\eta/s$ as a function of temperature. It turned out that the first approach can not distinguish between different $(\eta/s)(T)$ assumptions when the evolution is constrained to reproduce the low-$p_\perp$ data. In distinction, $(\eta/s)(T)$ calculated using the second approach agrees surprisingly well with the $(\eta/s)(T)$ inferred through state-of-the-art Bayesian analyses of the low-$p_\perp$ data even in the vicinity of $T_c$, while providing much smaller uncertainties at high temperatures.",en
https://openalex.org/W4380077830,2023,Physics,"The massive relic galaxy NGC 1277 is dark matter deficientAccording to the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, present-day galaxies with stellar masses $M_\star>10^{11} {\rm M}_\odot$ should contain a sizable fraction of dark matter within their stellar body. Models indicate that in massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) dark matter should account for $\sim60\%$ of the dynamical mass within five effective radii ($5 R_{\rm e}$). Most massive ETGs have been shaped through a two-phase process: the rapid growth of a compact core was followed by the accretion of an extended envelope through mergers. The exceedingly rare galaxies that have avoided the second phase, the so-called relic galaxies, are thought to be the frozen remains of the massive ETG population at $z\gtrsim2$. The best relic galaxy candidate discovered to date is NGC 1277, in the Perseus cluster. We used deep integral field GCMS data to revisit NGC 1277 out to an unprecedented radius of 6 kpc (corresponding to $5 R_{\rm e}$). By using Jeans anisotropic modelling we find a negligible dark matter fraction within $5 R_{\rm e}$ ($f_{\rm DM}(5 R_{\rm e})<0.05$; two-sigma confidence level), which is in tension with the expectation. Since the lack of an extended envelope would reduce dynamical friction and prevent the accretion of an envelope, we propose that NGC 1277 lost its dark matter very early or that it was dark matter deficient ab initio. We discuss our discovery in the framework of recent proposals suggesting that some relic galaxies may result from dark matter stripping as they fell in and interacted within galaxy clusters. Alternatively, NGC 1277 might have been born in a high-velocity collision of gas-rich proto-galactic fragments, where dark matter left behind a disc of dissipative baryons. We speculate that the relative velocities of $\approx2000 {\rm km/s}$ required for the latter process to happen were possible in the progenitors of the present-day rich galaxy clusters.",en

For that purpose, the two-nucleon densities resulting from nuclear shell-model calculations in one and two major shells are analyzed. Various tools are applied in this analysis including the sensitivity of correlation effects on components of the NN interaction. Significant effects on the resulting energies are observed due to the formation of T = 0 pairs. The formation of quasi-deuterons is maximal for symmetric nuclei with N = Z . The formation of T = 0 pairs is less sensitive to the density of single-particle states close to the Fermi energy than the T = 1 pairing. Therefore the correlations in T = 0 pairs are relevant also for excitations across shell closures. This robustness also explains why T = 0 pairing does not lead to such clear evidence in comparing energies of neighbored nuclei as the ‘odd–even mass staggering’ due to the formation of T = 1 pairing.",en

https://openalex.org/W4385877673,2023,Physics,"Gravity at cosmological distances: Explaining the accelerating expansion without dark energyThree theoretical criteria for gravitational theories beyond general relativity are considered: obtaining the cosmological constant as an integration constant, deriving the energy conservation law as a consequence of the field equations, rather than assuming it, and not necessarily considering conformally flat metrics as vacuum solutions. Existing theories, including general relativity, do not simultaneously fulfill all three criteria. To address this, a new gravitational field equation is proposed that satisfies these criteria. From this equation, a spherically symmetric exact solution is derived, which is a generalization of the Schwarzschild solution. It incorporates three terms: the Schwarzschild term, the de Sitter term, and a newly discovered term, which is proportional to ${r}^{4}$ in a radial coordinate, that becomes significant only at large distances. The equation is further applied to cosmology, deriving an equation for the scale factor. It then presents a solution that describes the transition from decelerating to accelerating expansion in a matter-dominated universe. This is achieved without the need for negative pressure as dark energy or the positive cosmological constant. This provides a novel explanation for the current accelerating expansion of the universe.",en

We propose a filtering model to filter out the significant detuning components between a thermal-mechanical mode and its surrounding heat baths in the weak coupling limit. We reveal that protecting continuous-variable entanglement involves the elimination of degrees of freedom associated with significant detuning components, thereby resisting decoherence. We construct a nonlinear Langevin equation of the filtering model and numerically show that the filtering model doubles the robustness of the stationary maximum optomechanical entanglement to the thermal fluctuation noise and mechanical damping. Furthermore, we generalize these results to an optical cavity array with one oscillating end-mirror to investigate the long-distance optimal optomechanical entanglement transfer. Our study breaks new ground for applying the resonance effect to protect quantum systems from decoherence and advancing the possibilities of large-scale quantum information processing and quantum network construction.",en
https://openalex.org/W4383878467,2023,Physics,"A Bayesian estimation of the Milky Way’s circular velocity curve using <i>Gaia</i> DR3Aims. Our goal is to calculate the circular velocity curve of the Milky Way, along with corresponding uncertainties that quantify various sources of systematic uncertainty in a self-consistent manner. Methods. The observed rotational velocities are described as circular velocities minus the asymmetric drift. The latter is described by the radial axisymmetric Jeans equation. We thus reconstruct the circular velocity curve between Galactocentric distances from 5 kpc to 14 kpc using a Bayesian inference approach. The estimated error bars quantify uncertainties in the Sun’s Galactocentric distance and the spatial-kinematic morphology of the tracer stars. As tracers, we used a sample of roughly 0.6 million stars on the red giant branch stars with six-dimensional phase-space coordinates from Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3). More than 99% of the sample is confined to a quarter of the stellar disc with mean radial, rotational, and vertical velocity dispersions of (35 ± 18) km s −1 , (25 ± 13) km s −1 , and (19 ± 9) km s −1 , respectively. Results. We find a circular velocity curve with a slope of 0.4 ± 0.6 km s −1 kpc −1 , which is consistent with a flat curve within the uncertainties. We further estimate a circular velocity at the Sun’s position of v c ( R 0 ) = 233 ± 7 km s −1 and that a region in the Sun’s vicinity, characterised by a physical length scale of ∼1 kpc, moves with a bulk motion of V LSR = 7 ± 7 km s −1 . Finally, we estimate that the dark matter (DM) mass within 14 kpc is log 10 M DM (R &lt; 14kpc)/ M ⊙ =(11.2 +2.0 -2.3 ) and the local spherically averaged DM density is ρ DM ( R O )=(0.41 +0.10 -0.09 ) GeV cm -3 = (0.011 +0.003 -0.002 ) M ⊙ pc -3 .

Here, it is shown that, via tunneling, the scarred state can be imaged to a region that does not support scarring. This “phantom scar” is also present in the spin channel and has marked influence on the spin‐dependent system dynamics, as illustrated by explicit calculations for the fidelity and correlation functions. Numerical simulations and analysis are performed for the spin‐dependent electron dynamics in semiconductor‐based double quantum dots, including disorder, Rashba‐type spin‐orbital coupling, exchange fields, and external magnetic fields.

A recent example is the prediction and experimental discovery of tetraquarks, which opened a new research field. Crucially, numerous unsolved questions regarding the standard model can exclusively be addressed by nonperturbative calculations. Quantum computers can solve problems for which well-established QCD methods are inapplicable, such as real-time evolution. We take a key step in exploring this possibility by designing a real-time evolution of tetraquark and pentaquark physics in one-dimensional SU(3) gauge theory. We also perform an experiment on a superconducting quantum computer demonstrating an elementary cell consisting of two staggered sites containing quarks and antiquarks with all three colors. This experiment represents an exciting step in quantum computation involving quarks with the gauge group of QCD.",en

Our methodology is versatile and allows us to solve a range of problems regarding arrangements of multiple beams per primitive cell, over Bragg to deep-subwavelength scales; we cross-verify against finite element numerical simulations to gain further confidence in our approach, which relies upon the hypothesis of Euler–Bernoulli beam theory considerably simplifying continuity conditions such that each beam can be replaced by point forces and moments applied to the neutral plane of the plate. The representations of Green’s functions by Fourier series or Fourier transforms readily follows, yielding rapid and accurate analytical schemes. The accuracy and flexibility of our solutions are demonstrated by engineering topologically non-trivial states, from primitive cells with broken spatial symmetries, following the phononic analogue of the Quantum Valley Hall Effect. Topologically protected states are produced and coexist along: interfaces between adjoining chiral-mirrored bulk media, and edges between one such chiral bulk and the surrounding bare elastic plate, allowing topological circuits to be designed with robust waveguiding. Our topologically protected interfacial states correspond to zero-line modes, and our topological edgestates are produced in accordance with the bulk-edge correspondence. These topologically non-trivial states exist within near flexural resonances of the constituent beams of the phononic crystal and hence can be tuned into a deep-subwavelength regime.",en

In this paper, we revisit this issue and consider the problem of perturbations in Lorentzian quantum cosmology by modifying the dispersion relation based on trans-Planckian physics. We consider two modified dispersion relations, the generalized Corley-Jacobson dispersion relation with higher momentum terms and the Unruh dispersion relation with a trans-Planckian mode cutoff, as examples.

In the experiment, we first load ultracold atoms into an optical lattice using the shortcut method and then accelerate the optical lattice by scanning the phase of lattice beams. The atomic transport at the $D$ band and $S$ band is demonstrated, respectively. The group velocity of atoms at the $D$ band is opposite to that at the $S$ band. By preparing superposition states with different superposition weights of the $D$-band and $S$-band atoms, we realize the manipulation of atomic group velocity from positive to negative, and observe the quantum interference between atoms at different bands.

We found that two DF classes are distinguished: class I (74.4%) corresponds to the standard DF properties and energy dissipation and a new class II (25.6%). This new class includes the six DF discussed in Alqeeq et al.

The possible origin of this second class is discussed. Both DF classes show that the energy conversion process in the spacecraft frame is driven by the diamagnetic current dominated by the ion pressure gradient. In the fluid frame, it is driven by the electron pressure gradient.

Magnetization measurements reveal three magnetic anomalies, the first one at ${T}_{N}^{\text{Fe}}\ensuremath{\sim}52.8$ K, the second one at ${T}_{{N}_{2}}\ensuremath{\sim}36.4$ K, and the third one at ${T}_{N}^{\text{Ho}}\ensuremath{\sim}6.8$ K, corresponding to the antiferromagnetic ordering of ${\mathrm{Fe}}^{3+}$, a possible spin structure change of ${\mathrm{Fe}}^{3+}$, and the antiferromagnetic ordering of ${\mathrm{Ho}}^{3+}$ sublattices, respectively. Surprisingly, the heat capacity data did not show any anomaly at ${T}_{N}^{\text{Fe}}$ but exhibited a broad maximum at ${T}_{N}^{\text{Ho}}$. Below 40 K, isothermal magnetization measurements indicate a metamagnetic transition at 1.5 T. The temperature-dependent dielectric measurements performed below 1 T reveal two anomalies, around 6 and 36 K, corresponding to ${\mathrm{Ho}}^{3+}$ ordering and a possible change in the magnetic phase of the Fe sublattice. These anomalies disappear at higher magnetic fields, and a different dielectric anomaly appears above the metamagnetic transition with a broad asymmetric peak around 13 K (${T}_{P}$), which shifts to higher temperatures, reaches a maximum under 2 T, and then is suppressed further on increasing the magnetic field up to 9 T. A switchable electric polarization appears below 25 K and above the metamagnetic transition field ($H\ensuremath{\ge}1.5$ T). Intriguingly, the polarization disappears above 5 T. The presence of electric polarization in intermediate magnetic fields and its strong magnetic field dependence are interesting and make this material unique.",en

This is because, in addition to causing damage to the helicopter body structure if the vibration generated are too large, it also affects the comfort of pilot and passengers. The vibration system on the helicopter consists of propeller, rotor mount, and suspension where there are dampers as dampers. In this research, a semi-active damper is used whose variables are controlled using Fourier analysis-based L1 adaptive control of the vibrations generated by the rotor. Fourier analysis is used to find the cutoff frequency of vibration used for tuning the L1 adaptive control. The results of the second-order band pass filter design in the system can improve the acceleration response up to 72.52% on the rotor mount and 65.94% of the helicopter body within 2 seconds. The design results can also handle displacement errors of 55.6% on the rotor mount and 55.56% on the helicopter body within 2 seconds.

Various observations in the vanadium antimonides discovered recently, such as the missing Kohn anomaly in the acoustic phonons or the latent heat at the transition T CDW = 95 K, further underpin this notion. Here, we study the Kagome metal CsV 3 Sb 5 using polarized inelastic light scattering. The electronic energy gap 2Δ as derived from the redistribution of the continuum is much larger than expected from mean-field theory and reaches values above 20 for 2Δ/k B T CDW . The A 1g phonon has a discontinuity at T CDW and a precursor starting 20 K above T CDW . Density functional theory qualitatively reproduces the redistribution of the electronic continuum at the CDW transition and the phonon energies of the pristine and distorted structures. The linewidths of all A 1g and E 2g phonon lines including those emerging below Tcdw were analyzed in terms of anharmonic symmetric decay revealing strong phonon-phonon coupling. In addition, we observe two CDW amplitude modes (AMs): one in A 1g symmetry and one in E 2g symmetry. The temperature dependence of both modes deviates from the prediction of mean-field theory. The A 1g AM displays an asymmetric Fano-type lineshape, suggestive of strong electron-phonon coupling. The asymmetric A 1g AM, along with the discontinuity of the A 1g phonon, the large phonon-phonon coupling parameters and the large gap ratio, indicate the importance of anharmonic strong phonon-phonon and electron-phonon coupling for the CDW formation in CsV 3 Sb 5 .",en

By measuring the time dependence of this perturbation, we track the nonequilibrium dynamics of the two-roton states on femtosecond and picosecond timescales. Our results reveal an ultrafast equilibration of roton pairs as they thermalize with the colder equilibrium quasiparticle gas.

The studied sample comprises all [WR] CSs that are currently known. The analysis is based on recent observations of the parallax, proper motion, and color index of [WR] CSs from the Gaia space mission’s early third release (eDR3) catalog, as well as common nebular characteristics. The results revealed an evolutionary sequence, in terms of decreasing T eff , from the early hot [WO 1] to the late cold [WC 12] stars. This evolutionary sequence extends beyond [WR] CS temperature and luminosity to additional CS and nebular characteristics. The statistical analysis shows that the mean final stellar mass and evolutionary age of the [WR] CS sample are 0.595 ± 0.13 M ⊙ and 9449 ± 2437 yr, respectively, with a mean nebular dynamical age of 7270 ± 1380 yr. In addition, we recognize that the color of the majority (∼85%) of [WR] CSs tends to be red rather than their genuine blue color.

These 75 Cepheid standards are the fundamental sample for investigation of possible residual systematics in the local H 0 determination due to metallicity effects on their period–luminosity relations. We obtained new high-resolution ( R ∼ 81,000), high-signal-to-noise (S/N ∼ 50–150) multiepoch spectra of 42 out of 75 Cepheid standards using the ESPaDOnS instrument at the 3.6 m Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope. Our spectroscopic metallicity measurements are in good agreement with the literature values with systematic differences up to 0.1 dex due to different metallicity scales. We homogenized and updated the spectroscopic metallicities of all 75 Milky Way Cepheid standards and derived their multiwavelength ( GVIJHK s ) period–luminosity–metallicity and period–Wesenheit–metallicity relations using the latest Gaia parallaxes. The metallicity coefficients of these empirically calibrated relations exhibit large uncertainties due to low statistics and a narrow metallicity range (Δ[Fe/H] = 0.6 dex). These metallicity coefficients are up to 3 times better constrained if we include Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud and range between −0.21 ± 0.07 and −0.43 ± 0.06 mag dex −1 .

This flow goes fuzzy in the event of turbulence. In pathological states, vascular stenosis is usually the culprit in turbulence. Whether turbulence ensues from a physiological state or else, there must be a concomitant sound that is at variance with the normative flow acoustics. This sound emanates from a source point which is more or less within the inception of stenosis. This paper aims to identify the vascular sound field that emanates from a source point, maybe, due to stenosis. As a prelude, it furnished the windowed equations of motion for a fluid (blood) occupying a vascular region to derive the fluid density form of the acoustic analogy. However, the parameter of higher interest in vascular acoustics is turbulent pressure. So, it was well considered, and its relationship with acceleration at the monitor points on the aortic surface was supplied. An aspect of this work is the analysis of heart murmur. The heart was presumed here to admit Kelvin-Voigt’s viscoelastic model and, therefore, the equations governing the model hold well in the present case. Details here suggest that the hemodynamic pressure fluctuation on the aortic lumen boundary and the concomitant turbulent flow precipitates aortic stenosis murmur.",en

Our findings indicate that as the anisotropic factor A increases, the drag force and jet quenching parameter both increase, while the diffusion coefficient decreases. Additionally, we observe that the energy loss becomes more significant when the quark moves perpendicular to the anisotropy direction in the transverse plane. The enhancement of the rescaled jet quenching parameters near critical temperature T c , as well as drag forces for a fast-moving heavy quark is observed, which presents one of the typical features of quantum chromodynamics phase transition.",en

By setting up an appropriately entangled state, it should be possible to find wormholes connecting any two quantum gravity theories (e.g. string theory and loop quantum gravity).

https://openalex.org/W4361265567,2023,Art,"Domestic Georgic: Labors of Preservation from Rabelais to MiltonKatie Kadue prefaces Domestic Georgic with a familiar epigraph drawn from John Milton’s Areopagitica: “Books are not absolutely dead things.” Kadue’s revelatory reading of this moment in Milton’s pamphlet suspends the usual questions about the freedom of the press to focus on his concern with preserved vitality, the idea that books are the stored and shelved lives of people as well as of their ideas. Milton calls books “that season’d life of man preserv’d and stor’d up”; they evoke, Kadue proposes, “a kitchen cabinet, storage closet, or medicine chest” (8). Her analyses of Milton’s metaphors unveil a domestic analogy that has always coexisted with the grandeur of the imagined Miltonic library of vital books and discerning readers. This is one of the many local readings in Domestic Georgic that illuminate overlooked aspects of household work in familiar sixteenth- and seventeenth-century texts. Now that I see the link between the library and the kitchen storeroom in Milton’s tract, I cannot unsee it, and I experienced this delightful sensation many times while reading this book. Kadue’s style, casual but erudite, also makes this book an unusually engaging read.Domestic Georgic is ultimately a book about labor: the mundane, if Sisyphean, work of clearing away waste, preserving food, organizing papers, and writing books that was the stuff of life and literature in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Kadue’s coinage domestic georgic names a mode rather than a genre, a theme she sees emerging from representations of household labor in works by François Rabelais, Edmund Spenser, Michel de Montaigne, Andrew Marvell, and John Milton. Kadue shows that renowned authors like these invoked the daily labor of housekeeping in their poetry, essays, tracts, and fictional prose. These writers, as Kadue demonstrates, also linked the routines of writing and humanist scholarship to the feminized, lower-class housework performed by unnamed cooks, servants, secretaries, wives, and daughters to sustain and preserve life in the household. Kadue’s approach benefits from theoretical engagements with Hannah Arendt, Silvia Federici, Lee Edelman, and Sianne Ngai, whose ideas about labor, futurity, and affect merge in this book to permit a sophisticated, generalizable picture of the domestic georgic mode to take shape.One strength of the organization of Domestic Georgic is Kadue’s consideration of French humanists Rabelais and Montaigne alongside their English contemporaries and inheritors. She extends the comparative focus of the book by integrating information from French, Latin, and English dietaries and recipe books into her chapters. Kadue begins with a chapter on Rabelais’s Tiers livre and Quart livre in which she argues that his loquacity and penchant for bodily excess have overshadowed dynamics of restraint and moderation in critical conversations about his works. Kadue reads metaphors of preservation, such as freezing and pickling, in these works to suggest that these practices have both humoral and philosophical significance for Rabelais. The daily labor of moderation of body and language ultimately sustains life and language in the Tiers livre and Quart livre. In her second chapter Kadue attends to the women and servants who similarly nourish Spenser’s heroes in The Faerie Queene. Where critical readings of the exploits of Guyon, Arthur, and Redcrosse have noted their shock, delay, or general ineffectiveness in epic pursuits, Kadue revisits key sites such as the kitchen of the House of Alma in book 2 to show these heroes in awe at domestic labor. Kadue contends that Spenser shifts readers’ attention to the labor that underpins sustenance, such as the supper that Alma feeds Guyon and Arthur after they gawk at the kitchen staff, whose dishes fuel the knights’ exploits in the end. Equally compelling is Kadue’s discussion of Guyon and Arthur’s visit to Eumnestes’s study in the House of Alma, which shifts to a consideration of the domestic staff who nourished Spenser and enabled his own literary pursuits. Kadue often turns her attention to the domestic scenes of writing and scholarship in the Renaissance to link the content of these literary works to the conditions of their production.Kadue’s account of Montaigne’s Essais in her third chapter takes inspiration from his frequent reflection on his kidney stones as a matter of health, as a part of his familial inheritance, and as a metaphor for writing and revising essays. Kadue reminds us that although Montaigne’s process of composition is well studied, the metaphors he used for his perpetual process of revision drew on bodily ailments and domestic cares. She shows that his daily, embodied routines of pain management, household coordination, and essay composition were intertwined with his understanding of his familial history and the parallel humanist legacy. Kadue builds on this discussion of paternity and lineage in her fourth chapter, on Marvell’s poem Upon Appleton House. Although the enigmatic poet’s style is often read as illusive or queer, Kadue sees Marvell’s metaphors of housework and preservation as intimately connected to the reproduction of heteropatriarchy, particularly to the transformation of Thomas Fairfax’s daughter, Mary, into a future mistress of Nun Appleton. The “meantime” created by the poem—to use Kadue’s formulation for the work’s extended present—offers a stasis oriented to future marriage rather than resuscitating the queer potential of the estate’s history as a convent. Kadue’s fifth chapter returns to Milton to consider preservation and housework in Areopagitica, Paradise Lost, and Paradise Regained. Kadue proposes that Adam and Eve’s prelapsarian gardening is a nonteleological form of domestic labor that structures Milton’s version of the fall. In Kadue’s reading, the futurity of these acts of epic preservation is cyclical rather than progressive: the ouroboros of domestic georgic consumes its own labors in a perpetual meantime. Kadue’s brief conclusion brings together two poems by women—Mary Collier’s 1739 “The Woman’s Labor,” titled after a thing that is never done, and Oswald’s 2011 Memorial, which explicitly links the georgic and the epic—to explore the connection between the domestic georgic mode and larger questions about georgic as a genre.Throughout Domestic Georgic Kadue’s study of this mode forges striking readings of familiar texts by investigating scenes of household drudgery, scholastic clutter, and their attendant metaphorics. These readings are often punctuated with brief discussions of recipes, advice from dietaries, and examples from works aimed at instructing readers in husbandry, gardening, cooking, and other household labor. Although these discussions deepen Kadue’s analysis of the literary texts that are her primary concern, much more might be said about, for example, Hannah Woolley’s recipes for preserves or Olivier de Serres’s winemaking advice. Kadue’s examples from “how to” literature might guide the work of other scholars who think about household labor and related topics. I also wonder what Kadue’s analysis would have looked like if not only these examples from practical works, many written by women, but also some of the literature under consideration had been much more explicitly about domestic labor and written by women, such as Margaret Cavendish’s recipe poems or Hester Pulter’s poems about pregnancy and confinement. Future scholars will certainly benefit from thinking with Kadue’s domestic georgic framework as they address works in which domestic concerns and household labors are central. Ultimately, Kadue’s book is a provocation to pay attention to these labors anew whether they underpin practical or poetic works.In the introduction and the conclusion of this book, Kadue connects the domestic georgic mode in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century writing to the current crisis in the humanities. She links Spenser’s servants, Montaigne’s secretary, and Milton’s amanuenses and daughters to the wives thanked in academic monographs—recently highlighted in Bruce Holsinger’s #ThanksForTyping Twitter hashtag—and to the feminized ranks of humanities faculty who perform the housekeeping that keeps academic departments afloat. As I read Kadue’s writing about the banality of writing, the piles of scholarly paperwork, and the perpetual maintenance of household management and bodily health, I could not help but think about my own experiences with the unending rounds of email, laundry, recycling, drafting articles, and uploading information into glitchy university systems. This is perhaps what I found most compelling about Kadue’s domestic georgic: it offers a new way to reflect on what we often overlook in texts from this period, in accounts of life in the past, and in our own careers and lives in the present. However, to address the crises in the humanities—the paucity of jobs, the precariousness of jobs that do exist, the reality that few of them actually support life (let alone a life of scholarship)—we will have to do much more than redirect our attention.",en
https://openalex.org/W4382722557,2023,Art,"Photography as Cinematic Ekphrasis: Intermedial Study in Garin Nugroho’s Opera JawaThe Opera Jawa (2006), directed by Garin Nugroho is an Indonesian film with unique hybridity of art media (music, dance, visual art installation, acting, photography). This study aims to provide an overview of photographic ekphrasis’s form, process, and function. This research used a descriptive qualitative method. Data collection was through observation with the note-taking documentation technique. Through intermedial studies, data analysis was carried out using Agnes Petho’s cinematic ekphrasis and photo-filmic theory. The results of the study show that Opera Jawa displays the characteristics of intermedial reference media through cinematic ekphrasis of photography in film. This matter is manifested at the diegetic media level through family photos of the character Setyo-Siti, and the extra-diegetic media through photographic frames introducing film characters. Cinematic Ekphrasis works with exchange strategies and crossing the borders of basic media modalities (material, sensory, space-time, semiotic) from film to photography. Cinematic ekphrasis ultimately forms a metaphor that mediates the experience and knowledge of film audiences toward the target media and the source media. Thus, Opera Jawa, as the target media, can offer its ideology as a result of Sinta Obong’s source media interpretation.",en

https://openalex.org/W4383226439,2023,Art,"Material and Technical Analysis as a Support for Art-Historical Characterization of Selected Mural Paintings in Austria around 1400Several medieval mural cycles in Austria were studied from the material and technical point of view, aiming to confirm (or reject) the art-historical hypothesis of their stylistic and workshop connection. These paintings can be found in the churches of Rust (“Fischerkirche”), Marz (Virgin’s Coronation parish church), Kobenz (St. Ruprecht parish church), Ofenbach (St. Veid parish church), and St. Johann am Steinfelde (St. John parish church). They were carried out around 1400 in the International Gothic style. Their workshop connections based on the style are doubtful, therefore, a material and technical study was carried out. Results showed different plaster composition, similar pigment palette, and diverse painting procedures. The murals in Marz, St. Johann, and the older register in Rust reveal important similarities such as plaster composition, predominant a fresco painting technique, the use of natural inorganic pigments, as well as many aspects of the painting procedure and modeling. On the contrary, those in Kobenz, Ofenbach, and the younger register in Rust differ considerably. The second group reveals lower quality in plaster composition, larger a secco parts, addition of synthetic pigments (Kobenz), and a rougher color modeling, indicating less skilled artists. The lower quality also results in a worse conservation state of these murals. The obtained results confirm the same workshop, but different artists in the first group, while in the second group no clear workshop/artist connection could be established.",en

Su obra gráfica conservada en MadridThis contribution focuses on the artist Miguel Ourvantzoff (Saint Petersburg, 1897–Madrid, 1980) and, specifically, on the study and assessment of his graphic production, preserved in the Biblioteca Nacional de España, Madrid. As the son of a member of the government of Tsar Nicholas II, he had to go into exile following the Bolshevik revolution. During this exile, and prompted by his spirit of adventure, he travelled to several European –Paris and Berlin– and South American cities –Buenos Aires and Cuzco, among others–. He settled in Madrid in 1951, where he continued to cultivate the art of drawing and illustration. Most of his works from his time in Madrid are kept in the Biblioteca Nacional de España. The series Apuntes madrileños (1964-1968), which was published by Gráficas Amara in twenty albums, is of particular interest. Ourvantzoff illustrated other albums on a variety of subjects: landscapes, monuments and castles in Spain and courtly literatura and other literary works.",en

https://openalex.org/W4385580252,2023,Art,"Francis Williams: Shedding light on the production, materials and techniques of the portrait of a Jamaican scholarAbstract The Victoria and Albert Museum holds an important portrait of the Jamaican scholar and writer Francis Williams (c.1692/97–1762), portrayed as a scholar in his study. It is believed to have been painted around 1745 by an unknown artist, but the circumstances of its production are unknown. A technical examination of the painting was performed using x‐radiography and infrared reflectography (IRR), macro x‐ray fluorescence scanning (XRF), digital microscopy, scanning electron microscopy with energy‐dispersive x‐ray spectroscopy (SEM–EDX) and reflectance imaging spectroscopy in the short‐wave infrared (SWIR). XRF, IRR and reflectance imaging spectroscopy in the SWIR revealed the distribution of inorganic pigments including lead white, earth pigments, Prussian blue, vermilion, orpiment (or pararealgar) and bone or ivory black. Pentimenti and a different sketched landscape were observed in the IRR images, highlighting changes in the final composition. Three‐dimensional (3D) digital microphotography provided additional historical and contextual information through the observation of book titles and details. High‐resolution digital imaging complemented analytical data. Results of the technical examination revealed the material composition and the development of the painting, contributing to shed new light on the production of the portrait, the history and significance of the portrait.",en

Frisbee technique is reflected in the different game actions, such as the multiple types of throws, displacements, sense of direction and types of jumps, which are fundamental in the two main actions of the game: defense and offense. The objective of the present study was to determine the effect of a plyometric training program on jumping ability in ultimate frisbee athletes (18-35 years old) in a sample of Colombian players. The study included 21 ultimate athletes from the municipality of Cajicá elite category, associated in four groups: 18-23 (n=5), 24-27 (n=4), 28-31 (n=6), 32-35 (n=6) with an average age of 27.64±5.10 years, a height 173.09±7.18 cm and a body mass of 70.41±9.47 kg. Quantitative approach study, descriptive type of study and quasi-experimental design. The statistical treatment was carried out using the Python program version 3.7.3. The results indicate that there are improvements in jumping capacity, although these differences are not significant in any of the jumps (SJ, CMJ, CMJB) (p=&gt;0.05), so, when relating the characteristics of the subjects, it is found that age does not represent an important factor in plyometric training on explosive strength. Thus, the variables studied in this research do not seem to be sensitive to an eight-week plyometric training program with an intensity of two weekly sessions to show significant differences in the development of explosive strength in elite category ultimate frisbee players.

https://openalex.org/W4387024541,2023,Art,"The curious case of uncurious creationABSTRACTThis paper seeks to answer the question: Can contemporary forms of artificial intelligence be creative? To answer this question, I consider three conditions that are commonly taken to be necessary for creativity. These are novelty, value, and agency. I argue that while contemporary AI models may have a claim to novelty and value, they cannot satisfy the kind of agency condition required for creativity. From this discussion, a new condition for creativity emerges. Creativity requires curiosity, a motivation to pursue epistemic goods. I argue that contemporary AI models do not satisfy this new condition. Because they lack both agency and curiosity, it is a mistake to attribute the same sort of creativity to AI that we prize in humans. Finally, I consider the question of whether these AI models stand to make human creativity in the arts and sciences obsolete, despite not being creative themselves. I argue, optimistically, that this is unlikely.KEYWORDS: Creativityartificial intelligencecuriosityaestheticsagency Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Notes1 I am grateful to Ian Cruise, Marc Lange, Grace-Anna Perry, Nathaniel Sharadin, Keshav Singh, and an anonymous reviewer for their helpful feedback on earlier drafts of this paper.2 For a historical overview of early work in AI, see Crevier (Citation1993) and McCorduck (Citation2004).3 See Bubeck et al. (Citation2023) for some illustrative examples.4 This declaration is the title of a post on Bill Gates’ blog, GatesNotes. See Gates (Citation2023).5 One exception to this is the Zhuangzist account of creativity drawn out by Julianne Chung (Citation2020, Citation2021, Citation2022). On Chung’s interpretation, creativity as conceived by Zhuangzi doesn’t require novelty, but instead requires spontaneity.6 Among those who argue that creativity requires novelty are Beardsley (Citation1965), Boden (Citation1992, Citation2005, Citation2010), Hills and Bird (Citation2019), Gaut (Citation2003, Citation2018), Kronfeldner (Citation2009, Citation2018), Miller (Citation2019), Simonton (Citation1999), and Stokes (Citation2008, Citation2011, Citation2014).7 See, for instance, David Novitz (Citation1999), who argues that creative work must be surprising in the sense that it could not have been easily predicted by the community in which the creative work occurs. Relatedly, Robert Audi (Citation2018) also claims that unpredictability is the crucial sort of novelty for creativity, but argues that it should not be equated with surprisingness.8 Of course, the relevant sort of novelty here might not only be a matter of whether the sentence has been composed before – either historically or psychologically. It might also be a matter of how similar it is to other sentences that have been composed before. This suggests that novelty comes in degrees. For further discussion of this idea, see Brainard (Citationms). I am grateful to Marc Lange for suggesting I address this.9 For some accounts that include value as a necessarily condition of creativity, see Amabile (Citation1996), Boden (Citation1992, Citation2005, Citation2010), Carruthers (Citation2011), Cropley and Cropley (Citation2013), Gaut (Citation2003, Citation2018), Kieran (Citation2014), and Novitz (Citation1999).10 Some philosophers have cast doubt on the claim that creativity is necessarily valuable. Specifically, Hills and Bird (Citation2018; Citation2019) have argued that creativity is not necessarily valuable because there are clear cases of creativity that are worthless as well as clear cases of creativity that are wholly bad. Gaut (Citation2018) has argued that creativity’s value is merely conditional.11 For a helpful overview of epistemic value, see Pritchard and Turri (Citation2018). For a discussion of epistemic value in the context of creativity, see Hawley (Citation2018).12 Monroe Beardsley argues for a similar claim about artistic creativity (Citation1965). On his view, artistic creativity involves unexpected changes and the author’s critical reflection and response to those changes. For this reason, the result of artistic creation can’t be fully anticipated before the process is complete.13 Some accounts of creativity build epistemic value into the definition directly. For instance, Arthur I. Miller defines creativity as ‘the production of new knowledge from already existing knowledge [which] is accomplished by problem solving.’ (Citation2019, 29)14 For an argument that creativity always has the epistemic value of understanding, see Brainard (Citationms).15 For a helpful explanation of why deep learning is a black box, see Blazek (Citation2022).16 See, for example, Brainard (Citationms.), Carruthers (Citation2006), Gaut (Citation2018), Kieran (Citation2014) Paul and Stokes (Citation2018), and Stokes (Citation2008, Citation2011, Citation2014). To my knowledge, the only argument against the claim that creativity requires agency is given by Currie and Turner (Citationforthcoming), who argue that evolutionary processes can be creative.17 I am grateful to Keshav Singh for this example and the point it illustrates.18 Berys Gaut (Citation2018) also argues that creativity requires an element of spontaneity.19 See Bengio, Goodfellow, and Courville (Citation2016) for an explanation of how deep learning models improve iteratively.20 Though the relevant notion of responsibility is stronger than mere causal responsibility, it is not moral responsibility, but rather a more generic form of agential responsibility (see Wolf Citation2015). For an argument that AI cannot achieve moral agency specifically, see Véliz (Citation2021). For discussion of one practical implication of that argument, see Véliz (Citation2023).21 Claire Anscomb (Citation2022) argues that, while AI models that produce images cannot be creative, there is a sense in which they deserve some credit for works of art they contribute to.22 See OpenAI (Citation2023d) for an overview of how human feedback is used to train GPT-4.23 For reasons to be skeptical about categorizing curiosity as a desire, see İnan (Citation2011) and Kvanvig (Citation2012).24 For accounts of curiosity that categorize it as a desire, see Litman and Spielberger (Citation2003), Whitcomb (Citation2010), and Zagzebski (Citation1996).25 The list of philosophers who characterize curiosity as a motivating force includes Baehr (Citation2011), İnan (Citation2011), Kvanvig (Citation2012), Morton (Citation2010), Miščević (Citation2007), Ross (Citation2020), and Whitcomb (Citation2010).26 Christen, Alfano, and Robinson (Citation2014) argue that the inquisitive self is one of the aspects of a person that comprises the disposition of intellectual humility.27 For the original presentation of the distinction between the context of discovery and the context of justification, see Reichenbach (Citation1938). For a historical overview of the way this distinction has usually been understood by philosophers of science, see Schickore (Citation2014).28 See Anfinsen (Citation1973) for an early description of the protein folding problem.29 For an overview of major theories regarding the value and function of scientific explanation, see Salmon (Citation1989).30 See, for instance, Blazek and Lin (Citation2021) and Garcez (Citation2023).",en

Kenyataan ini tentunya juga mempengaruhi sebuah bangunan Pendidikan, yang menjadi perhatian adalah efisien ruang di dalamnya agar terciptanya ruang yang nyaman untuk aktifitas yang vital seperti Pendidikan. Dari fenomena tersebut dirasa memiliki keterkaitan dengan gaya atau konsep rasionalisme, salah satu konsep turunan dari gaya arsitektur modern. Arsitektur rasionalisme yang berfokus terhadap fungsi sebuah ruang tentunya menuntut efisiensi dengan meminimalkan ornament ataupun hiasan serta sebagai penggantinya dalam mendukung kesan estetiknya, konsep rasionalisme menghadirkannya lewat organiknya bentuk-bentuk yang dituntut oleh ruang atau secara sederhana sering disebut bentuk ruang mengikuti fungsi.

Art and science of Architecture is a field that is required to be able to keep up with the times. In modern times, the area of human life has become a valuable thing for some people, especially urban people, which is certainly a gathering place for various levels of society. This fact certainly also affects an Education building, the concern is the efficient space in it in order to create a comfortable space for vital activities such as education. From this phenomenon, it is felt that it has a connection with the style or concept of rationalism, one of the concepts derived from the modern architectural style. The architecture of rationalism that focuses on the function of a space certainly demands efficiency by minimizing ornamentation or decoration and as a substitute in supporting its aesthetic impression, the concept of rationalism presents it through the organic forms demanded by space or simply often called the form of space following function. This research aims to find out and understand how the concept of rationalism in architecture is one of them by knowing the principles that shape it. Then find out how the application of the architectural concept of rationalism can be well applied to the elements of architecture itself. Some of the findings of this study include an understanding of the principles in buildings with the concept of rationalism architecture, as the most common is that the form tends to be monotonous from the combination of geometery forms. In addition, it also finds examples of architectural elements that are able to play a role in the application of the concept of rationalism. Keywords: Architecture, Rationalism, Education, Modern",en

It flourished in the Renaissance, but in eighteenth-century England the meaning of the trope was altered greatly when employed in popular culture, both in live theatrical presentations (by George Alexander Stevens) and in published poetry (by James Robertson, comedian of York). Originally, the trope signalled the virtuosity of the painter, who was able to fool the eye by depicting flies so real that the viewer attempted to shoo them off the picture. However, in the hands of Stevens and Robertson, that bit of theatre was turned on its head, as the supposed connoisseur engaged in a harsh criticism of a painting is startled when a fly that he thinks poorly depicted suddenly flies off the canvas, thereby rendering the connoisseur a satiric target.",en

Delacroix et la nature. Musée du Louvre and Le Passage, 2022. ISBN 978-2-84742-482-9. Pp. 160. A product of the pandemic, it is fitting and even poignant that this exhibition extended a breath of fresh air to Delacroix's storied artworks. Country and urban gardens, studies and inventories of trees and flowers, and an array of animal sketches seem like a welcome refuge from the painter's dark and intimidating grand format scenes of massacres, animal combats, and brooding interiors. Yet, the point of Delacroix et la nature is not to position the painter as a nature artist. Instead, all of the letters, journal entries, sketches, curiosities, and paintings recently displayed at the Musée Eugène Delacroix in Paris worked together to embrace the dissonance exemplified by a leading studio artist who was nevertheless sensitive to nature's beauties and processes. The catalog opens with a brief preface by Laurence des Cars, a specialist of nineteenth-century art recently appointed Director of the Musée du Louvre, who applauds the curators' selection of local works that minimized the need for long distance transport. It continues in a ""green"" vein with three essays that examine how Delacroix ""reinvented"" nature into his own creations; how his animal paintings differed from conventional hunting scenes of the time period; and how gardens and botany developed his sensitivity to the natural world. The ensuing presentation of the exhibition's works, which are often accompanied by ample notes, helps synthesize an otherwise seemingly eclectic array as it underscores Delacroix's strong sensibilities for nature, his keen eye for flora and fauna, and the processes by which he refashioned his experiences of nature into studio paintings. Smartly interspersed amongst the impressive collection of Delacroix's oil paintings and drawings were several animal sculptures created by Antoine Louis Barye, a friend who often accompanied the painter to the Jardin des Plantes to study its animals and to attend animal dissections. The exhibition culminated in Delacroix's studio (the museum is located on the site of his last residence in Paris, which had the rather unusual distinction of having a garden), where signature colorful oil paintings à la Rubens were juxtaposed with taxidermized animals from the nearby Maison Deyrolle as well as with landscape watercolors by the young Delacroix's friends Theodore and Newton Fielding. Delacroix et la nature might not have the scope of a major retrospective or ""blockbuster"" exhibition, but it is nonetheless powerful in how it offers an incisive and unique look at an interesting cross-section of Delacroix's works. The catalog is an essential supplement to the exhibition, since it expounds on certain artworks and offers helpful historical and biographical details. Above all, the catalog lends a sense of cohesion to what exhibition viewers might have perceived to be loosely organized themes. Specialists of Delacroix and of nineteenth-century studies are sure to benefit the most from the scholarly expertise that buttresses the catalog, but the exhibition itself was surely a delight for all visitors who could experience the richness of Delacroix's dramatic compositions through his intimate examinations of the natural world.

Mapping Florianópolis: experimenting with the possibilities of the mapa Abstract This paper aims to broaden analytical horizons for the working with cartography in basic education. For this, we brought the experience of the Cartografando Florianópolis activity carried out with the seventh year of a school in the Municipal Education. There are a total of seventeen maps and their speech cards produced by the students with the aim of problematizing the classic map as the only way to represent space and trace the existing geographic imaginaries about the city. The research was the theoretical framework for visual culture, cartography and teaching of geography such as Verónica Hollman, Gisele Girardi and Jörn Seemann. The analysis of the maps and their speech cards demonstrated how the visual records are important to understand the geographic imaginations about the represented city. The Florianópolis represented by the students is related to their living space, the characteristics of the neighborhood, the places they got to know with the school. The maps worked on in the classroom can go beyond the cartographic concepts of space, when they bring everyday features and even sentimental perceptions of the city and the city. Thus, we evidenced that feelings also permeate the space experienced by the students, and that is why they were symbolically represented on maps and in speech cards.

As part of a still life cataloguing project, 19 of the flower still lifes have been examined using a wide range of scientific technologies, including MA‐XRF scanning. This paper will discuss how MA‐XRF analysis has significantly improved our understanding of the way artists prepared their compositions. It became apparent that there are several ways in which artists planned their painted bouquets. Early 17th‐century still life painters such as Baltahasar van der Ast used detailed underdrawings, which they followed during the painting stage. Artists from Antwerp, like Daniël Seghers started their paintings by making ‘abstract’ compositions of coloured circles and ovals. This method was picked up by Jan Davidsz, de Heem, who was working in both Antwerp and Utrecht. De Heem's pupils Abraham Mignon and Maria van Oosterwijck used a similar method, but other still life specialists such as Van Aelst and Rachel Ruysch planned their compositions differently.",en

This article tries to explore the specificity, the limits and the legacy of their theory of authorship by analizing the portraits of Giulio Paolini in comparison with Belpoliti's and Calvino's texts.",en

This research will reveal the impact of black race disorders who experience various forms of white race disorders. This research was conducted in line with the views of Newman’s critique. The research method used in this study is a qualitative descriptive method. The material object in this study is the short story Skin by Emily Bernard. The results of this study found several forms of harassment in the form of physical abuse and verbal expression. Discrimination that occurs also has an impact on the victim, as in the short story Skin, it affects the psychology of the victim, which causes the victim to experience excessive anxiety within herself over things that threaten her in the real world. Abstrak Cerita pendek Skin menceritakan bagaimana kehidupan sosial ras kulit hitam di Amerika Serikat yang mengalami diskriminasi oleh ras kulit putih yang mendominasi kehidupan sosial masyarakat. Penelitian ini akan mengungkap dampak dari diskriminasi ras kulit hitam yang mengalami berbagai macam bentuk diskriminasi dari ras kulit putih. Penelitian ini dilakukan sejalan dengan pandangan diskriminasi oleh Newman. Metode penelitian yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah metode deskriptif kualitatif.

https://openalex.org/W4327862856,2023,Art,"Federico García Lorca, poeta elegíaco y antielegíaco by Salvatore PoetaReviewed by: Federico García Lorca, poeta elegíaco y antielegíaco by Salvatore Poeta Grant Moss Poeta, Salvatore. Federico García Lorca, poeta elegíaco y antielegíaco. Editorial Pliegos, 2022. Pp. 351. ISBN 978-84-12257-58-8. In Federico García Lorca, poeta elegíaco y antielegíaco, Salvatore Poeta questions why few have centered on Federico García Lorca as an elegiac poet. Poeta argues that since Lorca created quite possibly the most emblematic Spanish elegy of all time in his Llanto por Ignacio Sánchez Mejías, the poet from Granada should be recognized as a superior elegist (14). However, Poeta reminds us that his argument is not to sustain an absolute model of the elegiac genre but to show how Lorca in some moments conformed to, and in other moments, subverted the tradition (49). The book begins with an in-depth, reasoned introduction where the author openly and acutely makes a case for Lorca’s leading position in the elegiac style. In fact, the introduction suggests that Lorca’s Llanto por Ignacio Sánchez Mejías may only be rivaled by Gilgamesh (the introduction compares them side by side in one instance). The densely-argued introduction offers insights to Poeta’s prior work on Lorca and on elegy; it prepares us for the multi-layered scholarly inquiry that follows. The main body of the text is identified as an “Antología;” while it does contain poems written by Lorca that reflect certain elements of elegies or anti-elegies, the true emphasis of each of the ten chapters is the intense literary scrutiny of Lorca’s poetics as either elegiac or anti-elegiac. For that end, each chapter begins with a comprehensive, foundational argument called Palabras preliminares; each Palabras preliminares section dissects the interconnected elegiac or anti-elegiac aspects of the poems that follow. The chapters include topics such as: pro-retro-gresiva funeral elegies, funeral elegies with auto-referential and auto-reflexive symbols, and funeral anti-elegies either of la vida sofocada or la muerte vivificada. The “Antología” has canonized poems and unfinished works that point to an underlying theme: Lorca as an elite elegist (or anti-elegist). The ten chapters of the “Antología” are followed by an ample appendix (“Apéndice. Especies al margen de la ‘función’ elegíaca”). The appendix contains some of Lorca’s writings that are neither elegiac nor anti-elegiac but those which seem to be close to performing the role of the elegy in some way. The appendix also includes a short conclusion called Palabras recapitulantes. Palabras recapitulantes reiterates the premise of the book: Lorca within the elegiac paradigm. Federico García Lorca, poeta elegíaco y antielegíaco’s multifaceted exploration of Lorca’s elegies and anti-elegies prompts readers to search Lorca’s writings with more attentiveness. Since [End Page 150] Poeta’s study of Lorca’s requiems and anti-requiems addresses four necessary elements of elegies (1. lyrical perspective and voice, 2. reconciliation of that which is not reconcilable, 3. meta-morphic transcendence, and 4. lyrical perspectivism), the book requires readers to concentrate their attention on aspects of the poetry far beyond impassioned voice (18–19). In that vein, readers will note that the anthological component aids the analysis but does not overtake it. Followers of Poeta’s prior work will not be disappointed with Federico García Lorca, poeta elegíaco y antielegíaco. The book is specifically designed for Lorca specialists or authorities on elegies (either in the Spanish tradition or otherwise). It offers new insights on Lorca’s work; it will be attractive to any Lorca scholars, particularly because of the analysis of both canonized writings and lesser-known poems. For that reason, it could also serve as a secondary resource for advanced graduate-level courses on twentieth-century Spanish poetry or Lorca’s works. For scholars who are interested in elegies, the book may convince them of Lorca’s position as a first-class elegist among the greats such as Jorge Manrique, Fernando de Rojas, or even the author of Gilgamesh.

Nevertheless, disturbing similarities emerge between the two authors: for Gide, as for Adrian Leverkühn, the “hero” of Mann’s Doktor Faustus, comparing oneself to Chopin means inventing an aesthetic ethic that plays the paradoxical role of a liberating and re-creating superego; it is an attempt to protect oneself from one’s own (homosexual) hauntings and desires in order to better discover them, and perhaps to better accept them. Thus, interartistic comparison becomes, in Gide’s and Mann’s works, the condition for the creation of the figure of the author’s “evil twin”.",en

https://openalex.org/W4309288425,2023,Art,"L’expression de la violence dans la conduite hikikomoriLa conduite Hikikomori qualifie un retrait au domicile primaire. Elle survient chez des sujets dont le tableau clinique témoigne de souffrances narcissico-identitaires organisées autour de clivages précoces. Les processus intellectuels et affectifs fonctionnent indépendamment, ce dont l’expression langagière témoigne. Les mots n’appellent pas d’images, ils se diluent dans d’abstraites généralités ou dans des énoncés factuels, sans que l’émotion les colore. Ces sujets instaurent une coupure avec le monde réel extérieur, comme pour retrouver un intérieur qui leur soit propre, à la frontière définitivement établie, en dur. Ils tentent une forme d’affirmation subjective en rejetant le dehors, mais le font en silence, pacifiquement, sans haine perceptible. Comment venir en aide à ces singuliers patients qui généralement ne formulent ni désir ni demande ? La première tâche du thérapeute est de parvenir à les rencontrer, parfois initialement au domicile. Lorsqu’un cadre de psychothérapie peut se mettre en place, ajusté au plus près des contraintes et résistances du patient, il va s’agir d’entreprendre un laborieux travail de reliaison entre les mots et les affects qui risque d’exposer à l’expression d’une violence verbale débridée, utilisant volontiers comme support les phénomènes culturels. L’actualité du monde s’offre comme médiation et canalise cette émergence pulsionnelle brute. Cette matière, culturelle au sens large, prend une place déterminante dans l’économie psychique des hikikomoris. Elle tient lieu d’extériorité et s’y déchargent les tensions au travers des mots, au fur et à mesure que ceux-ci sont pulsionnellement réinvestis. La visée du processus thérapeutique est d’accompagner la transformation de cette violence en une agressivité adressée, subjectivante, amorce d’une liaison libidinale s’opposant aux effets du clivage intrapsychique. In 1962, when Hanna Arendt proposed the concept of the banality of evil, Pierre Marty and Michel de M’Uzan for their part described operative thought. These two notions were developed in totally unrelated fields: that of war criminals on the one hand and that of patients undergoing consultation for psychosomatic illness on the other. However, they are related in the idea of an elaborative deficiency, an inability to think in the first person singular, in short, a subjective void. In order for this to happen, the developing subject begins to differentiate between his interior and the external real world that he rejects. In this operation of judgment, he learns how to deal with negation, the symbol of which becomes the condition of independence of thought, at the root of the subject. When this process fails, it will be necessary to look outside the libidinal potentialities which have not been constituted within by conforming to ambient values, for example, by the investment of perceptual reality and of the concrete world, as well. Hikikomoris patients fall within this spectrum of disorders, which René Roussillon describes, from a transnosographic perspective, as narcissistic identity suffering. An early division of the ego, established in an insufficiently adjusted primary object relationship, is regularly described as the source of these difficulties. Intellectual and affective processes are separated without further functional communication, as evidenced by language expression. Words do not call for images, they are diluted in abstract generalities or in factual statements, without emotion ever coloring them. The particularity of hikikomoris patients in this range of disorders is that they have cut themselves off from the real outside world, as if to find an interior of their own, at the definitively established border between the two. And if they do attempt a form of subjective affirmation by rejecting the outside world, it is in silence, peacefully, without perceptible hatred. How can we help these singular patients who generally formulate neither desire nor requests (the latter, on the other hand, coming strongly from an exhausted entourage, even desperate in the face of so much immobility that nothing seems able to rectify)? The first task of the therapist is to manage to meet them, sometimes initially at home. When a psychotherapy framework can be set up, adjusted as closely as possible to the constraints and resistance of the patient, it will be a question of helping him to restore meaning to his words, to embody a language that seems disaffected, free of emotion. The laborious work of linking words and affects risks exposing the therapist to the expression of unbridled verbal violence, against “shrinks” and all those who disturb, before the culture and current affairs of the world can offer themselves as mediation that channels this raw instinctual emergence. The confinement to home is usually punctuated by a large consumption of videos, anonymous exchanges on social media, and a thirst for a wide range of information. This matter, cultural in the broad sense, plays a decisive role in the psychic economy of the hikikomori patient. It replaces exteriority and tensions are relieved through words, as they are instinctually reinvested. The aim of the therapeutic process is to accompany the transformation of this violence into an addressed, subjectivizing aggressiveness, the beginning of a libidinal link opposing the effects of intra-psychic cleavage.",en

https://openalex.org/W4387490926,2023,Art,"Seán Gaffney: An Appreciation of the PoetAs he stands before the masterpiece, the poet, a “wandering Paddy, a butcher’s son,” feels the gaze of the painter, who peeks out from behind his canvas, if only momentarily, to contemplate the scene in front of him, a 17th-century Spanish artist catching the eye of 21st-century bard, who had dropped by the museum for a visit one mid-September day. The painter is Diego de Velázquez. The painting is Las Meninas. The poet is Seán Gaffney. The poem is “Figure/Ground.”1Seán has come to see, of course, for that is what one does at an art museum. And Seán, like so many others in the Prado that day, has come to see Las Meninas. But one cannot merely see Las Meninas. Velázquez’s magnum opus resists passive reception. “I can see him looking at me still,” notes Seán. The roles have been reversed. It is not Seán who stares at Velázquez; it is Velázquez who stares at Seán as the painter extends himself across space and time, “[g]rabbing me,” says Seán in his muscular verse, “balls, guts, heart and head.” But now the final turn, the final act of defiance that becomes its own profound moment of co-creation, for Seán refuses to be subsumed by the painter’s gaze; he will instead respond in kind, “[j]oining you here again, dear Don Diego,” but “[t]his time seeing you see me.”The story is not over, however. The process of seeing entails the possibility of invisibility, and invisibility abounds in Las Meninas. What is Velázquez limning on the large canvas that dominates the entire left side of his painting? And whom does the artist see as he looks out into the space that lies beyond the picture frame? For the cultural critic Michel Foucault (1973, 8), it is the mirror on the back wall in which we see the reflected image of King Philip IV and his wife Mariana de Austria that “allows us to see, in the centre of the canvas, what in the painting is doubly invisible.” Foucault argues that the mirror allows the viewer to see what is on the canvas and what lies outside the painting. The king and queen, who have come to the artist’s studio to sit for an official portrait, are at once present and not present within the pictorial space. Foucault may be right with respect to the royals, but is the same true of all viewers, viewers who, like Seán, now find themselves “standing where they [the royals] sat” looking at Velázquez’s painting of Velázquez at work painting? The world outside the picture frame is always changing. Museum patrons come and go, and some, like Seán, are gone too soon. Does the fleeting spectator have any permanence? Is the invisible real? Velázquez, alas, remains silent on the question. Seán, however, will have his say.Seán, you see, is comfortable in the presence of absence. In “Siblings,” for example, the silence that lingers in the house after his sisters’ visit grows “louder by the hour,” filling the void left behind in the wake of “hallway goodbye hugs” with a palpably disquieting quiet.2 The invisible has substance in a poem that demands that we understand, a poem that demands that we literally “stand under” and accept the weight of the memory of sibling chatter “now fading into the absence of silence” that slowly takes up residence in Sean’s home.The siblings’ visit is, at least, a memory of a lived moment, sisters there then gone. The family who visits Seán in “Who,” however, comes from a different kind of past, a past at once unattainable and inescapable.3 Named for an uncle he never knew, Seán lives in the shadow of that other Seán, an invisible specter, “always with me an ideal beyond my reach.” The two Seáns exist not as uncle and nephew, but as a single though composite being: “Now by my imagination so am I a you who lived on here in me still here and not still / Not me really nor you.” Two lives, simultaneously enmeshed and separate, each giving life to the other, enter into communion with each other, a kinship born in the mingling of one Seán’s silence and the other Sean’s verse. In carrying within him a past that was never his, a life that he never knew, Seán makes visible those “who made and make me who I am.” Such is the poet’s duty.",en

https://openalex.org/W4386588066,2023,Art,"VIOLA MINIATURE BY REBECCA CLARKEThe work of English composers of the first half of the XXth century, who actively composed for viola, is little known to music lovers. The now popular English composers L. Tertis and W. Wilton were most prominent in large-form works for viola (primarily in the genres of sonata and concerto with orchestra). One of the pioneers of chamber music for this instrument is the talented, but now almost unknown composer and violist Rebecca Clarke, who established the viola miniature as a distinctive and striking artistic phenomenon. The relevance of the study lies in the urgent need to introduce into musicology the information about the creative heritage of composers who created those works for viola that reveal the multifaceted artistic possibilities of this instrument. The purpose of the article is to illuminate the creative heritage of R. Clarke in the genres of miniature for viola and piano. Objectives of the article — to present the main biographical information about the composer; to show the importance of the viola in the development of the composer's style; to comprehensively analyze R. Clarke's miniatures for viola and piano. The author attempts to explore the composer's language, which is based on romantic traditions and heavily influenced by C. Debussy. The article focuses on R. Clarke's significant contribution to affirming the performance potential of viola in the chamber repertoire. The materials of the article can be used both by teachers of viola class and chamber ensemble as educational and didactic material, and by concert musicians to enrich their own performing repertoire.",en

This article examines Born in Israel, a photography project by Ya’akov Shofar that appeared as a photography book in 1984 and as an exhibition at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem in 2017, to unpack the differences between these two instances. Shofar’s 1984 project portrayed young Mizrahi Musrara men while being interviewed by a Jerusalem municipality social worker. This collaboration had political potential but only fragments of these interviews are reproduced in the book. Although the men participated in the Black Panthers’ protests, the book underscores their ethnicity and avoids mentioning this movement. My study explores the visual and discursive elements that depoliticised the book due to the Black Panthers’ perceived threat to the hegemonic social order and in relation to local developments in photography as fine art. I show that, unlike the book, the 2017 Israel museum exhibition promotes Born in Israel’s relation to the Black Panthers, but also had limitations and contradictions. Finally, I argue that accounting for the unabridged interviews uncovers hegemonic Israel’s patronising attitude towards the marginalised photographed men, and compensates for lacunas in this project’s presentations.Keywords: Ya’akov Shofar (1947–)Musrarasocial documentarysocially engaged photographyBlack Panthers of Israel (1971–73)Mizrahi protestMizrahi masculinityBorn in Israel (1978–842017) Notes1 – Henriette Dahan Kalev, ‘The Big Missed Opportunity of Israeli Democracy: The Traumatic Memory as Legacy of the Wadi Salib Protests’, Israel Democracy Institute Articles, 7 July 2009 (Hebrew), https://www.idi.org.il/articles/5474.2 – See Na’ama Klorman-Eraqi, ‘Acting Out for the Camera: Performing Mizrahi Masculinity and the Politicisation of the Jerusalem Neighbourhood, Katamon Tet’, Journal of Modern Jewish Studies (March 2023), 1–27.

In the late 1960s, ‘Mizrahim’ became the common category for Jews from Muslim countries and for understanding ethnic differences and tensions between them and the Ashkenazim. Since the 1980s, ‘Sepharadim’, the earlier prevalent term for marking Middle Eastern ethnicity, has been increasingly linked with religiosity. Throughout the 1980s, the two terms were used interchangeably.

Recent studies show that contingent punishment can also positively impact employees’ outcomes. Whether contingent reward can improve employees’ compliance behavior more than punishment can, has not been adequately studied. Exploring this issue can help researchers understand contingent reward and punishment from the perspective of the relationship norms between leaders and employees. Drawing on the planned behavior theory and cognitive appraisal theory, we developed and tested a model specifying why and how contingent reward (relative to contingent punishment) increase employees’ compliance behavior. Using a scenario-based experiment across two-stage surveys of 309 participants, we found that contingent reward (relative to contingent punishment) could influence compliance behavior by increasing and decreasing distinct types of affective attitudes (i.e., self-esteem and anxiety). Moreover, the perceived operational capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) moderated the effect of contingent reward on self-esteem and anxiety. High perceived operational capabilities of AI enhanced the positive effect of contingent reward (relative to contingent punishment) on self-esteem and its negative effect on anxiety as well. This research yields innovative insights for the improvement of compliance behavior.",en

It is a fact that in recent years people's interest in being healthy and physical appearance has increased. Therefore, it can be said that the number of people exercising is increasing day by day. It is seen that some of these people who exercise are now at the level of addiction. This study was conducted to determine the effect and relationship of personality traits on exercise addiction. Material and Methods. The sample of the study consists of 535 people, 160 females and 375 males, who are studying at Bandırma Onyedi Eylül University and selected by simple random sampling method. In order to collect data in the study a personal information form including the demographic characteristics of the participants was requested. The Exercise Addiction Scale for Youth was administered. The Five Factor Personality Scale, which consists of openness to experience, conscientiousness (self-control), extraversion, agreeableness and emotional instability (neuroticism) sub-dimensions, was used. T-test was used for pairwise comparisons and ANOVA test was used for multiple comparisons. Correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship between personality and exercise addiction and regression analysis was used to determine the effect of personality on exercise addiction. Results. In the study, it was determined that there was a significant difference in terms of exercise addiction in the variables of gender, age, having an athlete license and years of doing sports. In addition, it was seen that there was a significant difference in terms of personality sub-dimensions in the variables of gender, having an athlete license and years of doing sports. While it was seen that there was a significant positive correlation between the participants' personality scale average and exercise addiction. It was determined that personality explained 18% of exercise addiction. Conclusions. As a result of the study, it was observed that: being male and being a licensed athlete increased the level of exercise addiction; the exercise habit turned into addiction with increasing age. Personality traits were found to have a positive relationship and significant effect on exercise addiction.",en

Here we provide the first detailed analysis of the adult outcomes of the group of institutionally deprived-then-adopted children identified as displaying QA.Twenty-six adult adoptees identified with QA in childhood (Childhood QA+) were compared to 75 adoptees who experienced extended institutional deprivation (>6 months) but no QA (Childhood QA-), and 116 adoptees exposed to Low/No institutional deprivation. The outcomes were child-to-adult developmental trajectories of neuro-developmental symptoms (autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), disinhibited social engagement (DSE) and cognitive impairment), adult functioning, life satisfaction and mental health.Childhood QA+ was associated with elevated and persistent trajectories of broad-based autism-related difficulties, ADHD and DSE symptoms and low IQ, as well as adult mental health difficulties and functional impairment, including high rates of low educational attainment and unemployment. Life satisfaction and self-esteem were unaffected. Autism-related communication problems, in particular, predicted negative adult outcomes. Childhood QA+ was still associated with poor outcomes even when ADHD, DSE and IQ were controlled.Early and time-limited institutional deprivation has a critical impact on adult functioning, in part via its association with an early established and persistent variant of autism, especially related to communication difficulties. Apparent similarities and differences to non-deprivation related autism are discussed.",en
https://openalex.org/W4323825475,2023,Psychology,"Taste-Odor Association Learning Alters the Dynamics of Intraoral Odor Responses in the Posterior Piriform Cortex of Awake RatsHow an odor is perceived is to a large extent dependent on the context in which that odor is (or has been) experienced. For example, experiencing an odor in mixture with taste during consumption can instill taste qualities in the percept of that odor (e.g., vanilla, an odor, has a gustatory quality: sweet). How associative features of odors are encoded in the brain remains unknown, but previous work suggests an important role for ongoing interactions between piriform cortex and extraolfactory systems. Here, we tested the hypothesis that piriform cortex dynamically encodes taste associations of odors. Rats were trained to associate one of two odors with saccharin; the other odor remained neutral. Before and after training, we tested preferences for the saccharin-associated odor versus the neutral odor, and recorded spiking responses from ensembles of neurons in posterior piriform cortex (pPC) to intraoral delivery of small drops of the same odor solutions. The results show that animals successfully learned taste-odor associations. At the neural level, single pPC neuron responses to the saccharin-paired odor were selectively altered following conditioning. Altered response patterns appeared after 1 s following stimulus delivery, and successfully discriminated between the two odors. However, firing rate patterns in the late epoch appeared different from firing rates early in the early epoch (<1 s following stimulus delivery). That is, in different response epoch, neurons used different codes to represent the difference between the two odors. The same dynamic coding scheme was observed at the ensemble level.",en

Drawing on the dual theory of narcissism and the conservation of resources theory, this study aimed to explore the relationship between narcissistic duality traits (narcissistic admiration and narcissistic rivalry) and organizational citizenship behavior of college students, and to further examine the mediating role of impression management motivation (assertive impression management motivation and defensive impression management motivation) and the moderating roles of teamwork, interpersonal relationships, and optimism.We used the questionnaire method with a sample of undergraduate and graduate students from several universities in Hubei, China. The data sample for analysis consists of 583 college students.(1) Narcissistic admiration had a significant and positive effect on college students' organizational citizenship behavior, while the effect of narcissistic rivalry was significant and negative; (2) assertive impression management motivation mediated the relationship between narcissistic admiration and college student's organizational citizenship behavior, and defensive impression management motivation mediated the relationship between narcissistic rivalry and college student' s organizational citizenship behavior; and (3) teamwork, interpersonal relationships, and optimism positively moderated the relationship between narcissistic admiration and assertive impression management motivation, and these variables positively moderated the indirect effects of assertive narcissism on college student's organizational citizenship behavior through assertive impression management motivation.We found that college students with narcissistic admiration engaged in more organizational citizenship behaviors than those with narcissistic rivalry. In addition, narcissistic admiration had a positive effect on organizational citizenship behavior through assertive impression management motivation, and narcissistic rivalry had a negative effect on organizational citizenship behavior through defensive impression management motivation. Finally, teamwork, interpersonal relationships, and optimism significantly and positively mediated the relationship between narcissistic admiration and assertive impression management motivation, and the indirect effect of narcissistic admiration on organizational citizenship behavior through assertive impression management motivation. However, the direct effects of teamwork, interpersonal relationships, and optimism on the relationship between narcissistic rivalry and defensive impression management motivation, and the indirect effect of narcissistic rivalry on organizational citizenship behavior through defensive impression management motivation were not significant.",en

This study investigates various types of sexual violence experienced by the LGBTQ+ students and the prevalence of reporting it. The study further determines why different types of sexual violence are not being reported. This study uses a LGBTQ+ scholarship survey data conducted in 2019. Using Pearson’s chi square analysis, the study investigates the relationship between who experienced various kinds of sexual violence and those who do not report it. The study provides descriptive analysis of reasons for not reporting sexual violence across different types of sexual violence. The results show that there is a statistically significant relationship between those who experienced various kinds of sexual violence and those who do not report it. In addition, the study illustrates mistrust in support services and fear of embarrassment as the major reasons resulting in non-reporting behaviors. In conclusion, the study illustrates high prevalence for various types of sexual violence against LGBTQ+ students as well as high underreporting.

https://openalex.org/W4386972810,2023,Psychology,"Psychological Challenges of Distant Parenting on Mothers: Scoping ReviewThe involvement of parents in the lives of children is of paramount importance. Parents’ responsibility of ensuring the wellbeing of children should be taken into cognisance. Of late, some parents find themselves parenting from a distance as they leave in pursuit of employment. As a result, these parents experienced different challenges. The problem is that most researchers tend to focus on challenges experienced by children and leave out those experienced by parents. Hence, this paper aimed at synthesizing existing literature on the psychological challenges of distant parenting on mothers. In doing so, the researchers used a scoping review. The documents, which were used in the study, were purposively sampled from ScienceDirect and Google Scholar. From the literature, the researchers found that parents experienced stress and guilt as a result of leaving their children behind. Some of the parents experienced loss of connection with their children due to the distance and were stigmatized in the community/societies. It can be concluded that long-distance parenting remains high with severe implications for the lives of parents. The researchers recommend a phenomenological study on the lived experiences of fathers providing care to their distant children.",en

Children with ASD are unlikely to restore the ability of living independent, which definitely brings their parents greater psychological pressure and psychological problems such as social anxiety. Therefore, it is pressing to conduct intervention research on social anxiety and other problems in parents of children with ASD. &#x0D; Methods: In 2022, Seventy-three parents of children with ASD were enrolled from Beijing Tongkangyuan Children's Rehabilitation Institute. They were randomly divided into the experiment group (N=36) and the control group (N=37). The experiment group was intervened with psychological counseling based on problem management plus in combination with Tai Chi. The control group did not receive any psychological intervention. Social Anxiety Scale for Children, Parenting Stress Index-Short Form and Social Support Rate Scale were used for measurement before and after the intervention.&#x0D; Results: The experiment group had significantly higher decreases than the control group in the total score in social anxiety and the scores in its two dimensions after intervention (P=0.001). The experiment group had significant decreases in the total score in parenting stress and the scores in parenting distress and dysfunctional parent-child interaction (P=0.001), while there was no change in the control group. The experiment group had significant improvement in social support, which was also significantly higher than that of the control group (P=0.001).&#x0D; Conclusion: Psychological counseling based on problem management plus could effectively alleviate social anxiety and parental pressure in parents of children with ASD, improve their social support and play a significant role in enhancing their mental health.",en
https://openalex.org/W4386878275,2023,Psychology,"Emergence of a three‐sample conditional discrimination as foundation for reasoning capabilitiesWe hypothesized that a three-sample conditional discrimination can emerge as a result of learning conditional discriminations with relational stimuli. After learning three first-order conditional discriminations AB, PQ, and CD, we taught a second-order conditional discrimination XAB in which X1 indicated selection of related stimuli (e.g., A1 and B1) and X2 of unrelated stimuli (e.g., A1 and B2). Then, we probed the emergence of conditional discriminations PQX and XCD in which the X stimuli were comparisons and contextual stimuli, respectively. Finally, a conditional discrimination was probed with stimuli P, Q, and C as samples and D1 and D2 as comparisons. When the P and Q stimuli were related (and related to X1 in PQX), all participants selected the D stimulus that was related to the C stimulus (D1 when C1 was present and D2 when C2 was present); when the P and Q stimuli were unrelated (and related to X2 in PQX), they selected the D stimulus unrelated to the C stimulus (D2 when C1 and D1 when C2), which demonstrated emergence based on the relations established among all stimuli. In Experiment 2, the teaching of XAB was omitted and only one in six participants demonstrated emergence, which indicated that relational stimuli X1 and X2 played an important role in emergence. Thus, a new type of emergence that mimics analogical reasoning was demonstrated. The obtained outcome suggests that this procedure provides a learning foundation for acquiring reasoning capabilities.",en

This study explored prevalence rates among these patients and associations between type D characteristics, rumination and metacognitions.Forty-seven consecutive patients with CHD who scored positive for type D personality were included in this pre-planned study. Participants underwent structured clinical interviews for mental and personality disorders and completed questionnaires assessing rumination and metacognitions.Mean age was 53.8 (SD 8.1) years and 21.3% were female. At least one mood disorder or anxiety disorder was found in 70.2% and 61.7% of the patients. The most common disorders were major depressive disorder (59.6%), social phobia (40.4%), and generalized anxiety disorder (29.8%). At least one personality disorder was detected in 42.6%. Only 21% reported ongoing treatment with psychotropic medication whereas none had psychotherapy. Metacognitions and rumination were significantly associated with negative affectivity (0.53-0.72, p < .001) but not social inhibition.Mood and anxiety disorders were highly prevalent and relatively untreated among these patients.

That is why higher education must adapt its teaching and learning process to cultivate critical thinking of students. In order for academia to ensure the effectiveness of the development of critical thinking skills, student perceptions cannot be neglected, given that they are the ultimate receptors. In addition, investigating students’ perceptions of critical thinking skills could guide future training methods that promote their development. The purpose of this research is to explore students' attitudes and beliefs regarding critical thinking skills, as well as aspects of their development in academia and their transfer to other contexts. The study is conducted at the Dunarea de Jos University of Galaţi and uses the questionnaire survey method to assess students' perceptions of critical thinking, from several perspectives: the level of knowledge on critical thinking skills, strategies for learning critical thinking skills, the qualities of a critical thinker, the way students relate to the COVID 19 pandemic and fake news. To obtain the necessary data, the questionnaire was distributed through Microsoft Forms and subsequently analyzed to describe students' views on critical thinking. A sample of 101 students from specializations in the field of socio-humanities completed this survey. The results of the study showed that students invoke the need to overcome difficulties in developing critical thinking skills by: training teachers to use critical thinking in the classroom; including and practicing critical thinking skills in applied activities at courses and seminars; applying debates and discussions in the classroom as teaching and learning strategies; translating the theories learned in courses into different case studies; use of training skills, questionnaires, homework; participation in group projects in a collaborative environment.",en

https://openalex.org/W4367593652,2023,Psychology,"The relationship between smartphone addiction, gender, externality and failure avoidanceIntroduction. Numerous studies have reported a direct relationship between smartphone addiction and psychological distress: depression, anxiety, stress, decreased self-esteem and self-control, loneliness, impulsivity, neuroticism, problems with sleep, health, quality of life and life dissatisfaction. The purpose of the reported study is to identify links between smartphone addiction, externality, motivation to avoid failure, and components of gender. Materials and Methods. Smartphone addiction was assessed using the short version of Smartphone Dependency Scale questionnaire (V. Sheinov), gender was assessed with S. Bem’s questionnaire, locus of control with the modified I-E scale (J. Rotter), achievement motivation with A. Mekhrabian’s questionnaire; dependence on social networks with ZSS-15 questionnaire (V. Sheinov). The respondents also answered questions about their relationships with parents. The study involved 506 students, teachers and parents (M=18.45 years, SD=2.4), 261 (51%) women and 245 (49%) men. The data were obtained in student groups and through social networks. The sample included students from different fields of study: economics, chemistry, pedagogy, cultural studies, computer science, forestry, rescue work, etc. Results. Smartphone addiction is positively associated with externality and motivation to avoid failures, social media addiction, femininity and “gender difference”. It is negatively associated with masculinity and “gender sum”. A greater dependence on smartphone in women can be explained by the fact that women are much more represented by femininity. Family relationships affect smartphone addiction: the worse the relationships with parents, the stronger smartphone addiction. The data testify to the acceleration of androgynization in young people. Some links generally correspond to correlations established in foreign studies. The established links between smartphone addiction and psychological gender are new for domestic and foreign studies. Conclusions. Teachers are advised to raise the awareness of school and university students about the benefits of direct communication and negative consequences of smartphone addiction. This makes the reported study practically relevant.",en

However, the effect of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) treatment on metacognition has not yet been investigated.To validate the Metacognitions Questionnaire (MCQ-30) in a Brazilian GAD sample and verify whether different interventions reduce metacognitive beliefs.We recruited 180 GAD individuals and randomized them to Body in Mind Training (BMT), Fluoxetine (FLX), or an active control group (Quality of Life [QoL]) for 8 weeks. The MCQ-30 was assessed for internal consistency, was evaluated with confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses, and was tested for convergent validity with the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ). Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were employed to analyze differences after the interventions.The MCQ-30 demonstrated good internal consistency and acceptability; the original five-factor model was supported. There was a positive moderate correlation between MCQ-30 scores and worry. GEE showed a significant group x time interaction (p < 0.001). Both BMT (mean difference [MD] = -6.04, standard error [SE] = -2.39, p = 0.034) and FLX (MD = -5.78, SE = 1.91, p = 0.007) reduced MCQ-30 scores. FLX was superior to QoL, but not BMT, at weeks 5 and 8. There were no differences between BMT and QoL.The Brazilian-Portuguese version of MCQ-30 showed good psychometric properties.

Neuroimaging approaches frequently use hippocampal subfield volumes as a standard measure of neurodegeneration, thus making them an essential biomarker to study. Collectively, histologic parcellation studies contain various disagreements, discrepancies, and omissions. The present study aimed to advance the hippocampal subfield segmentation field by establishing the first histology based parcellation protocol, applied to n = 22 human hippocampal samples.The protocol focuses on five cellular traits observed in the pyramidal layer of the human hippocampus. We coin this approach the pentad protocol. The traits were: chromophilia, neuron size, packing density, clustering, and collinearity. Subfields included were CA1, CA2, CA3, CA4, prosubiculum, subiculum, presubiculum, parasubiculum, as well as the medial (uncal) subfields Subu, CA1u, CA2u, CA3u, and CA4u. We also establish nine distinct anterior-posterior levels of the hippocampus in the coronal plane to document rostrocaudal differences.Applying the pentad protocol, we parcellated 13 subfields at nine levels in 22 samples. We found that CA1 had the smallest neurons, CA2 showed high neuronal clustering, and CA3 displayed the most collinear neurons of the CA fields. The border between presubiculum and subiculum was staircase shaped, and parasubiculum had larger neurons than presubiculum. We also demonstrate cytoarchitectural evidence that CA4 and prosubiculum exist as individual subfields.This protocol is comprehensive, regimented and supplies a high number of samples, hippocampal subfields, and anterior-posterior coronal levels. The pentad protocol utilizes the gold standard approach for the human hippocampus subfield parcellation.",en

Evidence has shown how people deviate from traditional rational-choice predictions under different levels of social interactions. The emergence of prosocial decision-making, defined as any action that is addressed to benefit another individual even at the expense of personal benefits, has been reported as an example of such social influence. Furthermore, brain evidence has shown the involvement of structures such as the prefrontal cortex, anterior insula, and midcingulate cortex during decision settings in which a decision maker interacts with others under physical pain or distress or while being observed by others.Using a slightly modified version of the dictator game and EEG recordings, we tested the hypothesis that the inclusion of another person into the decision setting increases prosocial decisions in young adults and that this increase is higher when the other person is associated with others in need. At the brain level, we hypothesized that the increase in prosocial decisions correlates with frontal theta activity.The results showed that including another person in the decision, setting increased prosocial behavior only when this presence was associated with someone in need. This effect was associated with an increase in frontocentral theta-oscillatory activity. These results suggest that the presence of someone in need enhances empathy concerns and norm compliance, raising the participants' prosocial decision-making.",en

Residential nature and social brain function in childhoodHuman social cognition is considered an essential skill necessary for socially appropriate behaviours and social integration. Childhood is a time of rapid social expansion and growing independence from parents, but it is also a period of vulnerability in which children have unequal opportunities for optimal development. Accumulating evidence suggests that access to greenery, such as trees, shrubs, and grassed areas, might promote social skills in children. In this pre-registered, cross-sectional study, we found that vegetation cover around the home was associated with theory of mind (b/SE = 18.36/6.49, p = 0.006, Bayes Factor (BF) = 2.711) but not affect recognition (4.51/6.99, 0.52, 0.133) in 5–12 year-old children (n = 85).

An Exploration on the Effects of Stimulus Types and Memory Paradigms.In recognition memory the variance of the target distribution is almost universally found to be greater than that of the lure distribution. However, these estimates commonly come from long-term memory paradigms where words are used as stimuli. Two exceptions to this rule have found evidence for greater lure variability: a short-term memory task (Yotsumoto et al., 2008) and in an eyewitness memory paradigm (Wixted et al., 2018). In the presentwork, we conducted a series of recognition memory experiments using different stimulus (faces vs. words) along with different paradigms (long-term vs. short-term) to evaluate whether either of these conditions would result in greater variability in lure items. Greater target variability was observed across stimulus types and memory paradigms.

The purpose of the present systematic review is to synthesize the available data on the role of emotional intelligence in the leadership of various domains (businesses, schools, sports teams, teams). It attempts to show emotional intelligence's positive and direct relationship with leadership, especially with charismatic leadership. Material and method: This systematic review was carried out for 2019-2023. Criteria for inclusion of an article in the study were to be published from 2019 to 2023, to be relevant to the topic, to be published in a valid journal, to be published in the English language, to belong to the discipline of psychology, and to have open access. After a systematic and critical evaluation, seven articles were included in the study. Results: The studies addressed the role of emotional intelligence in leadership and their interaction. Transformational leadership leads people with high emotional intelligence to adapt. In addition, leadership skills training develops practical skills, assessment and problem-solving skills, communication skills, self-governance, and emotion recognition skills. Emotional intelligence plays a pivotal role in effective leadership. Leaders with high EI tend to be more transformational, make better decisions, manage stress effectively, and create cohesive team dynamics. While the relevance of EI in leadership is undeniable, future research will undoubtedly continue to refine our understanding of its nuances and applications in diverse contexts.",en

Previous studies highlight the importance of boosting positive emotions and social connectedness to combat loneliness. However, interventions targeting these protective psychosocial resources remain largely untested.In this study, we aim to test the feasibility of a short animated storytelling video, written messages boosting social connectedness, and a combination of both for alleviating loneliness.We enrolled 252 participants who were 18 years or older and spoke fluent German. Participants were recruited from a previous study on loneliness in Germany. We measured the effects of a combination of an animated video and written messages (intervention A), an animated video (intervention B), and written messages (intervention C) on loneliness, self-esteem, self-efficacy, and hope. We compared these with a control arm, which did not receive any intervention. The animated video was developed by Stanford University School of Medicine to reflect experiences of social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic and convey messages of hope and solidarity. The written messages communicate four findings from recent studies on loneliness in Germany: (1) over a period of 6 months, 66% of respondents in Germany reported feeling lonely (feelings of loneliness are surprisingly common); (2) physical activity can ease feelings of loneliness; (3) focusing on ""what really matters"" in one's life can help to ease feelings of loneliness; and (4) turning to friends for companionship and support can ease feelings of loneliness. Participants were randomized 1:1:1:1 to interventions A, B, C, and the control condition, using the randomization feature of the web-based platform ""Unipark,"" on which our trial takes place. Both the study investigators and analysts were blinded to the trial assignments. The primary outcome, loneliness, was measured using the short-form UCLA Loneliness Scale (ULS-8). Our secondary outcomes included the scores of the Coping with Loneliness Questionnaire, the 10-item Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE), the 10-item General Self-Efficacy Scale, and the 12-item Adult Hope Scale (AHS).We observed no statistically significant effect of the tested interventions on loneliness scores, controlling for the baseline loneliness score before an intervention (all P values >.11). However, we observed significantly greater intention to cope with loneliness after exposure to an animated video when compared with the control (β=4.14; t248=1.74; 1-tailed P=.04).Our results provide meaningful evidence for the feasibility of a full-scale study. Our study sheds light on the intention to cope with loneliness and explores the potential for creative digital interventions to enhance this psychological precursor, which is integral to overcoming loneliness.German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00027116; https://drks.de/search/en/trial/DRKS00027116.",en

The main areas of application of the competence approach are analyzed: in the field of education, in special pedagogy and psychology, in management and law enforcement activities. The role of temporal competence in personality development is revealed. Part of the empirical research on ontogenetic and professional reflection as a part of temporal competence is represented. Temporal competence and its varieties directly affect every person at any age and can be considered one of the key competences of the individual. Among the numerous types of competence (life, psychological, subject, curricular, situational, personal and self development competence, etc.), it is time that not only occupies a special status in the structure of the personality, but is also an important component of it, since during life a person must rationally manage the allotted time, predict the future events of your life, build time perspectives of your achievements, reflect on the acquired life experience and implement it in your personal and professional life. Time competence not only helps to predict awareness of time, emotional attitude towards it, organization of time in professional and personal life, but also the formation of such important personality characteristics as high stress resistance, emotional stability, self-realization, which allows it to be considered as an important element in the personality structure. The importance of the formation of temporal competence at various stages of ontogenesis should be based on the characteristics of the personality, temperament, previous life experience, etc. Considering temporal competence as an important element of personality, special attention should be paid to reflective abilities regarding the analysis of the development of life experience in a temporal sweep and regarding the reflection of professional activity.",en

This study focused on analyzing the relationships between personality traits (extroversion, openness to experience, shyness) and college connectedness, course satisfaction, mental well-being, and desire to be more connected to college. Participants included 209 randomly selected students aged 18 years or older recruited from a community college in the Midwest. Participants completed a 150-item self-report survey in March 2022 that assessed the variables using standardized measures. As expected, correlational analyses found that extraversion had a significant positive relationship with college connectedness and mental well-being. However, we did not find significant relationships between extraversion and course satisfaction or desire to be more connected. Consistent with our hypothesis, openness had a significant positive correlation with each of the variables but was assessed cautiously due to a low alpha level. As expected, shyness had a significant negative correlation with college connectedness, course satisfaction, and mental well-being-being, but not with desire to be more connected. In studying personality as a static trait, we can better understand that extraverted, open, and shy individuals tend to maintain levels of college connectedness, satisfaction, and mental well-being even when unexpected turmoil (e.g., a pandemic) occurs. Future research can investigate how educators can adjust the culture of their courses to accommodate personality variation among students and develop personality-specific ways to strengthen the adaptability of college students.",en

However, it is unclear how cultural attitudes towards cannabis use might affect the brain processes underlying cannabis use. Methods. Resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) within and between the executive control network, salience network, and default mode network was assessed in 110 near-daily dependent cannabis users and 79 controls from The Netherlands and Texas, USA. Participants completed a questionnaire assessing the perceived benefits and harms of cannabis use from their personal, friends-family’s and country-state’s perspective and reported on their cannabis use (gram/week), DSM-5 cannabis use disorder (CUD) symptoms, and cannabis related problems. Results. RSFC within the dorsal salience network was lower in cannabis users than controls and was negatively associated with cannabis use in the cannabis group. Cultural attitudes – from personal, friends-family’s and country-state’s perspectives – moderated the associations of cannabis use, CUD symptoms, and cannabis use related problems with RSFC within the salience, executive control, and default mode networks. No group differences in between-network RSFC were observed, but personal perceived benefits and country-state perceived harms moderated the association between CUD symptoms and RSFC between the dorsal and ventral default mode network. Conclusions. This study highlights the importance of considering individual differences in the perceived harms and benefits of cannabis use as a factor in the associations between brain functioning and cannabis use, CUD symptoms, and cannabis use related problems.",en

https://openalex.org/W4386086596,2023,Psychology,"Representing Online Hostility against WomenOn 6 March 2023, the Australian journalist Lisa Millar appeared on the television programme ABC News Breakfast (of which she is a host) wearing a skirt with a thigh-exposing slit. Photographs of this appearance were circulated on Twitter alongside misogynist commentary about the choice of attire. Millar addressed this commentary on air, admonishing not only those who posted it but also the media outlets where it was republished. This article uses the Millar case as a prism through which to pursue the question: “what are the ethical considerations for journalists when representing online hostility against women?” The article suggests that journalistic representations are significant not only because they help construct public understandings of the issues being reported, but because of the repetition that necessarily constitutes representation. The very term “representation” connotes the “re-presentation” of something past; in the case study, journalists – through graphically depicting the hostility Millar has endured – ­have effectively (and probably unintentionally) exacerbated that hostility. The article concludes with a list of ethical considerations and explores how journalists may negotiate these when reporting on misogynist online abuse. Online Hostility against Women: Research Gap Online hostility is “a cultural condition which has emerged as a practice of communication; and an attitude or mode of disposition towards others that reflects and is produced by the instantaneity of online communication” (Thompson and Cover 1771). The term encompasses a range of practices that are designed primarily or exclusively to offend, degrade, or subjugate. These practices include trolling (posting content to generate heightened responses), doxing (posting personal details – e.g., home addresses – online without permission), and cyberbullying. The study to which this article belongs seeks to contribute to ongoing research into online hostility directed against women. Researchers have demonstrated that this hostility reflects and exacerbates broader gender inequality (Jane, “Back”), and that it has a parlous impact on wellbeing, especially for those who are abused online and those who witness or are otherwise made aware of this abuse. Online hostility can cause psychological damage (Vakhitova et al.) and make victims reluctant to participate in online fora; Millar herself left Twitter in 2021 after being abused on that platform (Quinn). Online hostility against women can be amplified by prejudices including racism, as witnessed in online attacks against African-American actress Leslie Jones (Lawson) and Sudanese-Australian Muslim commentator Yassmin Abdel-Magied (Fyfe). A growing corpus of scholarship has investigated hostility against female journalists. Fiona Martin notes that “journalists are disproportionately subject to online violence due to the public nature of their work, their focus on covering and analysing aspects of societal conflict and their normative watchdog role” (75). Martin further acknowledges that women journalists “are subject to more frequent, image-oriented and sexualised violence, with deeper structural and social roots and more significant impacts than for men in their profession” (75). Millar’s 2023 Twitter attackers made hostile comments about her physical appearance; victims can be maligned on account of other factors, too, including their ethnicity, sexual identity, or religion. Online hostility against female journalists has also taken the form of rape and death threats (Jane, “Back”), and social media posts attacking them for working in traditionally “masculine” journalistic domains such as sports reporting (Antunovic). Currently, little research exists on journalistic representations of online hostility against women. This is striking given the pivotal roles that journalistic reportage still plays in constructing public understandings of social issues. An exception is a 2017 study which found that “media frames of trolling reinforce the normalisation of online violence against women as an extension of or proxy for gendered violence” (Lumsden and Morgan 936). This study’s findings echo studies of the ways in which “offline” violence against women (including rape and murder) has been represented in media texts (e.g., Morgan). Representation: Politics and Repetition This article is premised firstly on the argument that representation is an inherently ideological endeavour. Stuart Hall suggests this when he argues that representation “connects meaning and language to culture”; it gives form/s to the way we view and experience the world, legitimising and challenging dominant power systems (Hall 1). This kind of argument has informed feminist scholarship on how mediatised representations of violence against women reinforce gendered power imbalances and stereotypes; the 2017 study cited above is one example. Secondly, the article argues that the power of representation lies in the logic of repetition. This is suggested by the word itself; the object of representation is re-presented, staged again via the deployment of language and visuals – sometimes on multiple occasions. In a to-camera address recorded during ABC Breakfast News on 8 March 2023 (not coincidentally, International Women’s Day), Millar remarked: “that [her online abuse] then ended up online on some news sites where the photos and the abuse were republished made me angry”. The journalistic reportage cited by Millar re-presents that hostility – which was already highly public by virtue of the target’s media profile and by its enactment on Twitter – in public fora (including media outlets that publish journalism). In doing so, this reportage risks granting legitimacy to that hostility; the latter becomes worthy of repeating, even as it may be framed as problematic. In this respect, there are echoes of reportage on right-wing extremists, which – while sometimes well-intentioned – has given those actors “a level of visibility and legitimacy that even they could scarcely believe” (Phillips 32). (It should be acknowledged that online hostility is not perpetrated only by those aligned with a specific political disposition.) Further, journalistic representations of online hostility against women involve the re-presentation of hostility that has – in some cases – been re-presented multiple times on social media platforms. Research has demonstrated that hostile comments and the resharing of abusive content “by very large or uncountable numbers of individuals” can amplify the hostility’s force (Thompson and Cover 1772). This appears to have been the case with Millar; shots of the skirt were shared even by those claiming to defend her, as were vituperative comments about the clothing, and these were shared yet again in certain media coverage (on the 8 March broadcast, Millar’s co-host Michael Rowland identifies news.com.au and Daily Mail as publishers of this coverage). That coverage could then be shared and re-shared on social media. Ethical Considerations for Journalists This section begins the task – one that is beyond the scope of a single article – of outlining the ethical considerations journalists should make in producing representations of online hostility against women. The section is informed by ongoing scholarship on media ethics, and especially two of its key aims: mitigating harm and maximising equitable participation in online spaces, including social media platforms (Johnson). The section draws on insights from extant scholarship on media representations of violence against women. The following considerations may be adapted to studies of ethical reportage on racism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia. The first consideration involves abandoning gendered stereotypes. Stuart Hall argues that “stereotypes get hold of the few, ‘simple, vivid, memorable, easily grasped and widely recognized’ characteristics about a person, reduce everything about the person to those traits, exaggerate and simplify them” (247; emphasis in original). The simplicity of stereotypes and their familiarity among audiences could make them a convenient go-to for journalists. Feminist media scholars have critiqued the stereotyping of female victims as either “undeserving” innocents or “deserving” (sexually active, revealingly dressed) vamps (Benedict; Morgan). Journalist Ginger Gorman has critiqued the stereotyping of online hostility proponents as bizarre, unhinged, Other; these include the “loner in his mum’s basement” (24). In fact, Gorman argues, these individuals exist within the same society as “we” all do, one where gender inequality still holds currency; they are not rare bad actors (Gorman 264). The second consideration involves interviewing or otherwise obtaining quotes from victims. This should involve the cultivation of trauma literacy and, relatedly, an awareness of how certain lines of questioning can distress victims and journalists (Seely). In the case study under review, Millar decided to speak publicly about her online abuse and, in doing so, received support from her colleagues and television network employer (Meade). She had the platform and the (apparent) willingness to respond to her abusers. Her distress is nevertheless palpable in the 8 March broadcast. The third consideration concerns the explicitness of the detail provided about online hostility. This is especially contentious. Media scholar Emma A. Jane argues that a less explicit and more polite way of discussing [online hostility against women] may have the unintended consequence of both hiding from view its distinct characteristics and social, political and ethical upshots, and even blinding us to its existence and proliferation – of implying that it circulates only infrequently and/or only in the far flung fringes of the cybersphere. However, research … provides ample evidence to support the contention that gendered vitriol is proliferating in the cybersphere; so much so that issuing graphic rape and death threats has become a standard discursive move online. (“Back” 558) Jane is clarifying why she has chosen to report – sometimes verbatim – online misogyny. Her words have relevance for journalism. No ethical representation of online hostility against women should downplay its seriousness or frame it as being either an aberrant phenomenon or simply lively (but not necessarily injurious) banter. Jane has elsewhere chronicled the “economic vandalism” (her term) wrought by hostility directed against women workers, including journalists (Jane, “Gendered”). Nonetheless, Millar’s 8 March statement demonstrates that repeating online hostility in detail can (further) distress victims. This can also expand the reach of the hostility, and frame it as somehow worth repeating (even if only for the purpose of critique). The two media outlets accused by Michael Rowland of doing this both proclaim to abhor the abuse and do so via the florid language that is redolent of tabloid media. News.com.au describes the abuse as “sickening” (Borg); Daily Mail labels the abusers “vile online trolls” whose commentary was “disgustingly personal” (Milienos). The abhorrence is diminished by the republication in both pieces of abuse directed against Millar. One of these articles even quotes the tweets of a high-profile Australian Twitter user who – in admonishing Millar’s attackers – posted screenshots of abusive commentary. The fourth consideration involves acknowledging the systemic nature of online hostility against women. This does not comprise isolated acts of aggression against individuals. For instance, where there is space permitting, journalists could cite statistics regarding this hostility and its prevalence. In her 8 March address, Millar stated: [I am] angry on behalf of myself, and also on behalf of other women, young women who see those stories and see someone like me being violently abused day after day … I worry it might make [young women] think that no progress has been made and that it’s not worth it to be a woman in the public arena. Millar emphasises that online hostility does not impact only on its targets; it can potentially have a prohibitive impact on the public participation of all women, especially – though not only – when the target has a media profile. “Public participation” can entail working as a journalist or even using social media. The fifth, and perhaps most challenging, consideration entails how exactly more ethical journalistic representations of online hostility might be encouraged or welcomed in the contemporary mediascape. This consideration is as much for policymakers and journalism researchers as journalists themselves. The current Australian Federal Minister for Women, Katy Gallagher, described the republishing of hostile commentary about Millar as “providing clickbait to generate readers” (cited in May). This may seem simplistic – sensationalism and gendered stereotypes are not recent phenomena –, but it is a reminder that their commercial viability persists. There has been public outrage against gendered online hostility; statements by Rowland and myriad Twitter users (some of them journalists) exemplify this. Such outrage can have beneficial outcomes; for instance, research has demonstrated that online “call outs” against misogyny and sexism can publicly emphasise the harms it causes and, therefore, its unacceptability (Mendes et al.). These call outs ­– which include hashtag movements such as #MeToo and screenshots of threatening direct messages – can help attach negative meanings to sexist practices. Nonetheless, outrage in itself cannot prevent or necessarily even restrict hostility. For ethical journalistic representations of online hostility against women to flourish in any tangible sense, widespread institutional changes are required. The ethical considerations listed above could be taught within university journalism curricula, in the same way that trauma literacy has been (Seely; Thompson); in fairness, such teachings might well be underway. Those considerations could also inform guidelines for journalistic reportage of online hostility. There are already several (actual or proposed) guidelines for reporting on violence against women (e.g., Our Watch), as well as “digital safety strategies for women journalists” (Martin 74). Finally, ethical journalistic representations of online hostility against women must be accompanied by proper regulation of this hostility. Such regulations have been the topic of impassioned debate amongst media outlets and politicians in jurisdictions that include Australia (Beckett). Ethical representations – whatever these might look like (and they will necessarily be as diverse as journalism itself) – would have limited benefit in environments where the hostile actors are permitted to remain on the platforms where they abused others. This article has argued for the importance of ethical journalistic representations of online hostility against women. This hostility threatens the wellbeing of its victims and those who witness or are otherwise aware of the abuse; that threat is amplified when the hostile behaviour itself is re-presented, either by journalists or everyday social media users, in graphic detail. Those points have been teased out via the case study of Australian television journalist Lisa Millar. Millar’s Twitter abuse, and the subsequent reportage of that abuse, highlights a need for representations that educate audiences on the harms of online hostility without exacerbating those harms.

It is known that that changing negative thoughts and producing alternative thoughts have an important place in the treatment of social anxiety disorder. In Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, the focus is mainly on the person's negative thoughts about himself. Group Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBGT) is frequently used therapy model in anxiety disorders, including social anxiety. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of CBGT on the social anxiety levels of university students with SAD, as well as on their ruminative thinking and self-compassion. Methods: Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale was applied to 1200 students. 30 university students who had highest social anxiety levels were selected. The selected students were assigned to the experimental and placebo groups. CBGT was applied to the experimental group, and communication-based group therapy was applied to the placebo group. Results: There is a significant difference between pretest and posttest of the LSF and rumination levels of the experimental group. In addition, LFS and rumination post-test levels were found to differ significantly according to the group. There was no significant difference in self-compassion levels. Conclusion: The social anxiety and ruminative thinking levels of the students with social anxiety disorder who were applied cognitive behavioral group therapy decreased. No change was observed in the self-compassion levels of the individuals.",en

This study aimed to examine the effect of lemon essential oil inhalation on healthy participants’ alertness level and their neural correlates using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Twenty-one healthy men underwent functional MRI scans in different conditions: a resting state condition, a condition where they were exposed to passive lemon smelling (alternating exposure to lemon and breathing fresh air), and a control condition without lemon fragrance diffusion –the order of the last two conditions being randomized. Alertness levels were assessed immediately after each condition using the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale. Voxel-wise whole-brain global functional connectivity and graph theory analyses were computed to investigate brain functional connectivity and network topology alterations. After lemon fragrance inhalation, we observed a higher level of alertness as compared to resting state –but not compared to control condition. During lemon fragrance inhalation, we found increased global functional connectivity in the thalamus, paralleled by decreased global connectivity in several cortical regions such as precuneus, postcentral and precentral gyrus, lateral occipital cortex and paracingulate gyrus. Graph theory analysis revealed increased network integration in cortical regions typically involved in olfaction and emotion processing such as olfactory bulb, hypothalamus and thalamus, while decreased network segregation in several regions of the posterior part of the brain during olfaction as compared to resting state. The present findings suggest that lemon essential oil inhalation could increase the level of alertness.",en

Patients identified with PHIP typically present with intellectual disability, learning disorder, atypical social behavior, facial dysmorphism and obesity. Common co-occurring clinical conditions include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety and/or depression, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Neurocognitive functioning is notable for a leftward shift, presenting with a relative strength in language comprehension and weakness in nonverbal ability.This is a 9-year-old female with an atypical PHIP mutation. The patient was born full-term. The pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated (birth weight: 3572 grams). The PHIP mutation was identified in December 2020. Genetic testing was conducted due to developmental delay, ADHD, obesity, abnormal motor functioning, learning disability, and somatic complaints.Neuropsychological testing indicated average intellectual functioning (FSIQ = 94). There were strengths in verbal comprehension (VCI = 116), verbal learning, and reading, with relative weaknesses in non-verbal ability (NVI = 83), non-verbal learning, and math. Scores on measures of social perception (Affect Recognition, Theory of Mind) were consistent with verbal ability.This is an important case in understanding Chung-Jansen syndrome and PHIP. Most key clinical features are present (e.g., ADHD, atypical social behavior, obesity), albeit at a higher level of intellectual functioning. PHIP has typically been associated with intellectual disability; the present case suggests that the clinical pattern is present with higher functioning individuals as well. Genetic testing may be warranted when evaluating individuals with average cognitive functioning and relative strengths in verbal ability along with co-occurring atypical social behavior, ADHD, and obesity.",en
https://openalex.org/W4383819161,2023,Psychology,"Autistic and schizotypal traits exhibit similarities in their impact on mentalization and adult attachment impairmentsDeficits in mentalizing and attachment occur in the autism and schizophrenia spectrum, and their extended traits in the general population. Parental attachment and the broader social environment highly influence the development of mentalizing. Given the similarities in the symptomatology and neurodevelopmental correlates of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SCH), it is crucial to identify their overlaps and differences to support screening, differential diagnosis, and intervention. This cross-sectional study utilized questionnaire data from 2203 adults (65.1% female, mean age[SD] = 37.98[9.66]), including participants diagnosed with ASD, SCH, and those exhibiting subclinical traits to investigate the associations between mentalizing, attachment, and perceived social support during adolescence across the autistic and schizotypy spectrum. Results revealed that both autistic and schizotypal traits have comparable effects on insecure adult attachment, primarily through challenges in mentalizing. The impact of mentalizing deficits on adult attachment slightly varies between autistic and schizotypal traits. Conversely, perceived social support during adolescence relates to improved mentalizing and secure adult attachment as a protective factor during development. These outcomes highlight the significance of supportive therapeutic relationships and community care while suggesting directions for further research and collaborative treatments addressing ASD and SCH, considering the differential impact of mentalizing on adult attachment.",en
https://openalex.org/W3212464988,2023,Psychology,"The Perceived Need to be Hot: an Investigation of the Relationship Between Belief in Sexual Stereotypes and Erectile Dysfunction in Gay Men Using Thermal ImagingErectile dysfunction (ED) has been associated with considerable mental health and interpersonal problems, an increase in risky sex, and is particularly prevalent among gay and bisexual men. Psychological treatment protocols for sexual dysfunctions often aim at challenging beliefs and cognitions about the importance of a “perfect sexual performance,” known as sexual stereotypes. However, to date, little empirical evidence exists for the relationship between ED and belief in sexual stereotypes (BSS). To address this gap, 70 gay men were recruited; 30 with ED and 40 healthy controls. Participants completed a battery of questionnaires, including a measure of BSS, followed by having their genital temperature measured using a thermal imaging camera, while viewing a sexually explicit film. The study had four main objectives: (1) to evaluate between group differences in subjective sexual arousal and physiological arousal; (2) to examine within group differences in the effects of BSS on physiological and self-reported sexual arousal; (3) to evaluate the relationship between BSS, negative automatic thoughts during sex, and ED; and (4) to evaluate the relationship between ED and risky sex among gay men. Results revealed significant between-group differences in physiological arousal, but not in subjective sexual arousal. While between-group differences were found in BSS, no within-group differences were found in the relation of BSS on physiological and self-reported sexual arousal. No significant relationships were found between BSS, negative automatic thoughts, and ED. Participants with ED were found to be significantly more likely to use erectile enhancing drugs, but no significant differences in condom removal were found between groups; however, substantially more individuals with ED (23.3%) reported removing condoms prior to the completion of sexual activity, as compared to healthy controls (5%). Findings of this study contribute to improving psychological treatments for gay men with ED, as well as better understanding pathways leading to risky sex in gay men.",en
https://openalex.org/W4387440244,2023,Psychology,"A - 118 Disenfranchised Grief as a Part of Acquired Brain Injury Recovery: Role of the Feedback SessionAbstract Objective Disenfranchised grief is a response to events or a loss that society does not acknowledge, such as a loss of sense of self, opportunity, or one’s functioning. During the neuropsychological assessment process, this societal construct can often overlook the bereavement of one’s “old self,” which diminishes the opportunity for processing loss. This poster highlights the societal creation and further perpetuation of disenfranchised grief among individuals with ABI and neuropsychologists’ duty to name it in feedback sessions, igniting holistic recovery. Data Selection A literature review of peer-reviewed articles from 2011 to 2022 from PubMed and Google Scholar was conducted. Keywords include disenfranchised grief, acquired brain injury, neuropsychological feedback, brain injury, neuropsychological testing, stroke, and TBI. Data Synthesis The societal taboo surrounding non-death grief prevents individuals from processing this grief. Implications of unaddressed disenfranchised grief can include changes in one’s sense of self, withdrawal, feeling powerless, depression, and anxiety. Disenfranchised grief commonly emerges following acute rehabilitation. This can impact optimal cognitive performance during the assessment and daily functioning. Conclusions The social construction of the onset of disability perpetuates the inability to acknowledge grief following brain injury. Neuropsychologists can use the feedback session to initiate the healing process surrounding disenfranchised grief.

Previous studies investigated factors promoting adaptation to digitalization; however, outcomes from adaptation to a digitalized society have not been sorted into a parsimonious model, even though there should be several multifaceted outcomes (e.g., usefulness, economic profit, and social outcome), each of which is promoted by different factors. If the effects of individual background factors can be revealed, including the technical-environment and survival-relevant personality in relation to each outcome, it would help in the creation of a society where more people play an active role by adapting to digitalization. This study aimed to construct such a model by identifying major outcomes gained in a digitalized society and investigating individual factors that contribute to the degree of gain of each of these outcomes. Five dimensions were identified by online surveys and factor analysis: Socialization (outcomes derived from new social connections created online), Space–time (freedom from time and space constraints), Economics (monetary outcome by using digital services), and Information (ease and amount of acquisition of information) were the positive outcomes, whereas Loneliness (feelings of not being able to keep up with digitization) was identified as a negative outcome. We determined that technical-environmental factors (e.g., familiarity with digital techniques and the amount of money that can be used for digitalization) facilitated gain in four positive outcomes. Notably, leadership and conscientiousness facilitated the Socialization gain while etiquette suppressed it. These factors’ effects would reflect the importance of a personality trait prioritizing construction and maintenance of social relationships. This study implies that material outcomes (i.e., Space–time, Economics, and Information) are promoted by technical-environmental support, whereas social outcomes may additionally require motivation and a positive attitude for purposeful social engagement.",en

https://openalex.org/W4388440500,2023,Psychology,"Evidence for impaired hippocampal circuitry in schizophrenia and its link to memory dysfunctionAbstract Pattern separation and pattern completion are opposing yet complementary components of mnemonic processing that heavily rely on the hippocampus. It has been shown that processing within the dentate gyrus (DG) subfield promotes pattern separation while operations within the CA3 subfield are important for pattern completion. Schizophrenia has been associated with anatomical and functional hippocampal abnormalities, including within the DG and CA3. We hypothesized that an impairment in hippocampal circuitry in individuals with first-episode schizophrenia leads to deficits in pattern separation (mnemonic discrimination) and pattern completion (recognition memory), that these deficits contribute to delusions, and that antipsychotic treatment improves circuit functioning. We measured behavioral and neural responses during the identification of new, repeated, and similar stimuli using high-resolution fMRI in 45 medication-free or minimally-treated patients with first-episode schizophrenia and 49 matched controls. We found recognition memory and pattern separation deficits in patients and a negative association between memory performance and the severity of delusions. Neural analyses revealed deficits in both univariate BOLD responses and multivariate patterns in the hippocampus during mnemonic discrimination in patients compared to controls. Importantly, by investigating the association between trial-level neural activity and behavior before and after treatment, we found that antipsychotics normalized DG activity during pattern separation and CA3 activity during pattern completion. Lastly, trial-level cortical responses during mnemonic discrimination predicted performance in patients at baseline, suggesting a compensatory role. This study provides new insight into the impact of schizophrenia and antipsychotic treatment on memory systems and uncovers systems-level contributions to pattern separation and pattern completion.",en

Epilepsy is characterized by alterations in large-scale brain network dynamics. Here we exploited neuronal avalanches to characterize differences in electroencephalography (EEG) basal activity, free from seizures and/or interictal spikes, between patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and matched controls.We defined neuronal avalanches as starting when the z-scored source-reconstructed EEG signals crossed a specific threshold in any region and ending when all regions returned to baseline. This technique avoids data manipulation or assumptions of signal stationarity, focusing on the aperiodic, scale-free components of the signals. We computed individual avalanche transition matrices to track the probability of avalanche spreading across any two regions, compared them between patients and controls, and related them to memory performance in patients.We observed a robust topography of significant edges clustering in regions functionally and structurally relevant for the TLE, such as the entorhinal cortex, the inferior parietal and fusiform area, the inferior temporal gyrus, and the anterior cingulate cortex. We detected a significant correlation between the centrality of the entorhinal cortex in the transition matrix and the long-term memory performance (delay recall Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test).Our results show that the propagation patterns of large-scale neuronal avalanches are altered in TLE during the resting state, suggesting a potential diagnostic application in epilepsy.

However, the role of the thalamus and cerebellum when integrated into intrinsic networks and how those integrated networks interact in schizophrenia patients are largely unknown. We generated an integrative network map by merging thalamic and cerebellar network maps, which were parcellated using a winner-take-all approach, onto a cortical network map. Using cognitive networks, the default mode network (DMN), the dorsal attention network (DAN), the salience network (SAL), and the central executive network (CEN) as regions of interest, the FC of 48 schizophrenia patients was compared with that of 57 healthy controls (HCs). The association between abnormal FC and cognitive impairment was also investigated in patients. FC was lower between the SAL-CEN, SAL-DMN, and DMN-CEN and within-CEN in schizophrenia patients than in HCs. Hypoconnectivity between the DMN-CEN was correlated with impaired cognition in schizophrenia patients. Our findings broadly suggest the plausible role of the thalamus and cerebellum in integrative intrinsic networks in patients, which may contribute to the disrupted triple network and cognitive dysmetria in schizophrenia.",en

Similarly, introspective accuracy (IA) refers to the capacity to accurately assess one's skills, capabilities, and interpretations. CI and IA may be impaired in individuals with psychiatric disorders, as extensively documented in individuals with schizophrenia. However, there is a shortage of studies examining introspective accuracy in bipolar disorder. This scoping review aimed to provide an overview of the existing literature on CI and IA in individuals with bipolar disorder, as well as to examine their associations with clinical variables including cognitive performance. PubMed was systematically searched with the terms “cognitive insight”, “introspective accuracy”, “self estimation”, “self assessment”, “bipolar”, and “bipolar disorder”. Studies were included if they performed cognitive measures. Five studies (2015–2023) met the inclusion criteria and were further analyzed. Patients with bipolar disorder generally overestimate their cognitive performance, especially in numerical tasks. In a depressive episode, the performance was underestimated and related to impaired functioning. Manic symptoms and cognitive performance have been found to be predictors for low insight. The study results indicated that introspective accuracy is positively correlated with cognitive performance. Recent studies demonstrate the importance of cognitive insight and introspective accuracy measures for functional outcome parameters.

https://openalex.org/W4388014823,2023,Psychology,"Are reactions to frustrative nonreward in other animals a model for human anger? Neurobehavioral implications and therapeutic applications.Anger is a powerful and mostly deleterious emotion that can impair an individual's health and social relationships and that imposes considerable costs on society at large. It is a constituent of multiple psychopathologies, most notably intermittent explosive disorder. Excessive anger can drive injurious and even lethal reactive aggression. To understand its biobehavioral origins and develop appropriate therapeutic interventions, an animal model of human anger would be quite useful. The phenomena of aggression provoked by frustrative nonreward (FNR) in other animals, including species of fish, birds, and mammals, resemble those in people in whom it elicits subjectively experienced anger. The brief history presented here traces the original, overgeneralized frustration-aggression hypothesis for humans through to the discovery of operant schedule-induced attack in birds, rodents, and ourselves to the current status of FNR as a cross-species, transdiagnostic construct within the National Institute of Health Research Domain Criteria. Brain circuitry that is activated by frustration, generates felt anger and motivates reactive aggression includes discomfort reactions likely instantiated in the insula and cingulate gyrus of the salience network and reward expectancy/prediction error mediated by the ventral striatum and other structures. Caveats in establishing a paradigm for other animals that most closely matches FNR-induced anger in people include avoiding confounds with other aggression-provoking stimuli and situations, providing evidence for aggressive motivation, as well as behavior, and demonstrating activation of homologous brain structures. With appropriate regard for these caveats, developing such paradigms appears to be the best route to advancing psychopharmacological and deep brain stimulation treatments for excessive anger.

https://openalex.org/W4387747013,2023,Materials science,"A cooperative servo indenting approach for machining fine-crystallized microstructured surfaces on titanium alloysMicrostructured surfaces with subsurface fine crystallization have excellent mechanical properties. This study proposes a cooperative servo indenting (CSI) approach for accurately machining fine-crystallized microstructured surfaces on titanium alloys. Slow servo indentation is used in CSI to generate desired microstructured surfaces, in which large plastic strain is generated at the deep subsurface, resulting in subsurface dislocation concentration and grain refinement. Meanwhile, another fast servo motion (FSM) system cooperatively moves to compensate the springback errors according to the instantaneous indenting depth. To determine the compensating motions, a springback error model is proposed by considering the dynamic recrystallization (DRX), dislocation increment, indenting forces and subsurface strain-stress distribution. The proposed CSI approach and model are experimentally validated by machining different microstructured surfaces, such as hierarchical micro-grooves, micro QR codes, inverted micro-pyramid arrays, on Ti6Al4V alloys. The results show that springback errors lead to near 30% deviation between the machined microstructured surfaces and the desired ones, and the proposed CSI can efficiently reduce the springback errors from 4.26 to 0.62 µm. Through EBSD and nano-indentation analysis, it is also validated that highly increased dislocation density and DRX at the subsurface promote an increase of hardness of the microstructured surfaces. Besides, the grain size obviously reduces from 15 to 3 µm in the subsurface region at a depth of nearly 45 µm.",en

This work aims to identify the feasibility of incorporating pineapple leaf fiber to partially supersede glass fiber in thermoplastic-based fiber-metal laminates. Fiber-metal laminates made of pineapple leaf/glass/polypropylene/aluminum were fabricated using the hot press molding technique. The tensile, flexural, Charpy impact and quasi-static indentation tests were performed. The findings indicated that the hybridization of glass with pineapple leaf fibers improved the mechanical properties of the laminates. The results are particularly promising in [G/P/G] laminates in which their tensile and flexural strengths are 38.98% and 20.19% higher than [P/P/P] laminates. In addition, the Charpy impact strengths of [G/P/G] laminates are also 236.66% and 175.68% greater than those of [P/P/P] laminates. In terms of indentation properties, the maximum indentation forces of [G/P/G] laminates are 16.71% and 13.76% higher than those of [P/P/P] laminates at indenter diameters of 12.7 and 20.0 mm, respectively. Interestingly, in-plane and out-of-plane properties of [G/P/G] laminates were comparable to [G/G/G] laminates.

Different process parameters were set to grind the two materials. Then the surface morphologies and roughness of the workpieces with different process parameters were observed and measured. Experimental results indicated that the grinding forces were positively correlated with the grinding depth and feed speed, and negatively correlated with the wheel speed. The grinding depth was the main influencing factor of the maximum temperature of the grinding. The heat distribution of the grinding process was dependent on the fiber direction. In addition, the chip formation mechanism of CF/epoxy and CF/PEEK were investigated. Compared with CF/epoxy, the grinding forces and temperature were higher and the wheel was more prone to be clogged under the same grinding parameters, indicating that it was more difficult to process CF/PEEK.

Lapping or laser beam are done with a high cost of manufacturing and low material removal rates. Water abrasive jet cutting is a promising candidate since the machining temperatures and processing force of ceramics are extremely low. Investigation into the abrasive water jet machining of silicon carbide is carried out in the present work.The variations in traverse speed while abrasive water jet cutting of silicon carbide and its effect on the surface roughness and kerf characteristics are studied. Silicon Carbide abrasive material is used as garnet consisting of 80 mesh. The surface roughness was calculated along with the depth of the cut made during the processing.The outcomes demonstrated that the traverse speed is more effective upon the surface roughness and is an important factor that damages the top kerf width and the kerf taper angle.Based on the hardness and thickness of the SiC plate, the taper angle is high, and for a feed rate of 10 mm/min, the surface roughness is low. Less thickness of the SiC plate could have a lower taper angle than with high thickness. The erosive force is provided by abrasive material along with the jet stream.Water abrasive fine jet could effectively machinate silicon carbide ceramic material with a better surface finish accurately.

The advantages of using this technology include the production of shapes that cannot be produced by traditional machining technologies, the possibility of using trabecular reinforcing structures, and the ability to make parts with topological optimization that allow for increased performance and decreased mass of the parts produced. Metal parts produced by selective laser melting technology exhibit high surface roughness, which limits their direct implementation. Corrosion protection of these surfaces is difficult, especially for galvanic processes. This paper analyzes the possibility of using sol–gel silica (silicon oxide) coatings to effectively protect various surfaces of aluminum alloys produced by selective laser melting technology. Silicon oxide sol–gel protective coatings have demonstrated excellent chemical stability and corrosion resistance, being able to be applied in very thin layers. These properties make them excellent candidates for protecting additive-manufactured metal parts, especially as-built surfaces with a high surface roughness.

Therefore, the object of research was a change in the properties of the polymer sheath of the cable during the formation of a swollen coating layer under the influence of high temperature. It is proved that in the process of thermal action on the flame retardant coating, the process of thermal insulation of the cable involves the formation of particulate products on the surface of the sample. Under the action of the burner flame, a temperature was reached on the surface of the sample, which led to a swelling of the coating of more than 16 mm. The measured temperature on the inverse surface of the sample was no more than 160 °C, which indicates the formation of a barrier for temperature. In this regard, a calculation and experimental method for determining thermal conductivity when using a flame retardant as a coating has been developed, which makes it possible to estimate the coefficients of temperature conductivity and thermal conductivity under high-temperature action. According to the experimental data and established dependences, the coefficients of temperature conductivity and thermal conductivity of wood were calculated, which are 214.4·10–6 m2/s and 0.62 W/(m∙K), respectively, due to the formation of a heat-insulating swollen layer. The maximum possible temperature penetration through the thickness of the coating was assessed. A temperature was created on the surface of the sample, which significantly exceeds the ignition temperature of the polymer sheath of the cable, and, on a non-heated surface, does not exceed 160 °C. Thus, there is reason to argue about the possibility of directed adjustment of the fire protection processes of an electrical cable by using coatings capable of forming a protective layer on the surface of the material, which inhibits the rate of heat transfer.",en

The results show that the failure mode of corroded steel standard tensile coupon includes normal fault and oblique fault. The failure patterns of the test specimen show that the thickness of the steel and corrosion rate affected the corrosion resistance. Larger thicknesses and lower corrosion rates will delay the failure mode of corrosion on steel. The strength reduction factor (Ru), deformability reduction factor (Rd) and energy absorption reduction factor (Re) decrease linearly with the increasing corrosion rate from 0% to 30%. The results are interpreted also from the microstructural point of view. The number, size, and distribution of the pits are random when the steel is subjected to sulfate corrosion. The higher the corrosion rate, the clearer, denser, and more hemispherical the corrosion pits. The microstructure of steel tensile fracture can be divided into intergranular fracture and cleavage fracture. As the corrosion rate increases, the dimples at the tensile fracture gradually disappear and the cleavage surface gradually increases.

The delayed crack is formed at the segregation zone (SZ) located in the center of the 65 mm thick steel plate. The strength of the non-segregation zone (NSZ) with a martensite microstructure is slightly higher than that of SZ with a mixture microstructure of martensite plus bainite, and the plasticity of NSZ is significantly better than that of SZ.

However, the coating containing graphite has poor durability and surface quality, such as the formation of submicron cracks on the surface, which limit its use in a load-bearing application. These limitations encouraged the study of diamond-like carbon (DLC) performance in the aluminum oxide matrix since DLC consists of sp2-bonded carbon of graphite-like structure and sp3-bonded carbon of diamond-like structure. Since DLC usually exists as a thin film, it was deposited on copper particles that act as a carrier.

There is about 2.88% increase in the strength and about 6.7% increase in the strength for the 1 wt.% and 2 wt.% Kaolin nanoclay respectively, when compared to just resin sample. All the other nanoclay yielded a decrease in the strength. This indicated that Kaolin Clay dispersed and bonded better with epoxy. Carbon and glass fabric epoxy laminated plates were then manufactured using the VARTM method with Kaolin nanoclay and tested for their flexural properties. There is a significant increase in the properties of composites with about 20.88% increase in the strength for 1 wt.% and 17.94% for 2 wt.% for the carbon/epoxy nanocomposites. For the glass/epoxy nanocomposites, the corresponding increase and in the strength is by 27.64% for 1 wt.% and 16.21% for 2 wt.% with Kaolin nanoclay. Additionally, increased strain to failure indicates higher strain energy for the nanophased systems.",en

The chemical potential difference with respect to Ni atoms was first obtained, and used to reach the equilibrium elemental distributions in sample models with different Cu contents, grain sizes and twin thicknesses. By comparing the random and segregated configurations, the role of GB segregation was analyzed in detail. It is found that the GB segregation trend is Ni<Fe<Co<Cr<Cu. The Cu atoms have no preference to segregate at coherent twin boundaries, and their dominant segregation at GBs prevents the detwinning that usually occurs in softening stage, further increasing twin strength. The segregation with low concentration at GBs can improve the strength by suppressing dislocation emission from GBs and further enhance the GB-mediated plastic deformation; while excessive segregation at GBs results in harmful weakening effect with GB cracking. The transition from strengthening to weakening is closely related to the GB segregated Cu concentration. To estimate the critical segregation amount in case of maximum strength, a theoretical model was established, where three regions (strengthening, transition and weakening) are distinguished. It is revealed that the strengthening region occupies a small area, and the addition of Cu contents should be rigorously tailored. This work deepens the understanding of the strengthening mechanisms arising from GB segregation and provides insights into the design of ultrahigh-strength materials.",en

This study evaluated how filler load influences the color adjustment potential of composite restorations to human teeth of various shades. The performance of composites containing the 260 nm spherical fillers —OMN (79 wt%), OCF (71 wt%), and experimental composites R1 (65 wt%), and R2 (60 wt%)— was compared to two conventional A2-shade composites and a transparent composite. Additionally, the translucency parameter, spectral reflectance, and light transmission properties were assessed. Composites with a lower load of the 260 nm spherical fillers exhibited lower light diffusion and lower reflectance in the yellow-to-red range (580–650 nm), which is characteristic for the structural color of OMN and OCF.

As the package becomes thinner, the warpage of the semiconductor package becomes more important due to the reduced bending stiffness and driven by thermal residual stresses and thermal expansion mismatch during the epoxy molding compound (EMC) curing to create the package. To address this packaging reliability issue, in this study, we developed a modified cure cycle that adds a rapid cooling step to the conventional cure cycle (CCC) to enhance the reliability of the EMC molded to a copper substrate (EMC/Cu bi-layer package) by lowering the bonding temperature of the EMC/Cu bi-layer package. Modeling of the package via Timoshenko theory including effective cure shrinkage allowed the rapid cooling step to be quantified and confirmed via experiments.

A mixture design technique was used to assess the effect of the constituents on the physical-mechanical properties of composites, such as density, water absorption, flexural strength, compressive strength, and dynamic modulus. The aggregate/cement ratio ranged from 3.76 to 5.25, and the water/cement ratio was kept constant at 0.5, whereas a minimum of 30 vol% HDPE particles was considered in the system. The optimized responses and fractions were determined by considering five different scenarios through the statistical method desirability. The gradual replacement of quartz aggregates by HDPE led to a more porous material, increasing water absorption and reducing mechanical properties. However, these composites exhibited a less rigid characteristic, revealing a less brittle failure mode. Whereas the optimized density was obtained for the minimum matrix and maximum HDPE fractions, the optimal response for the mechanical properties and water absorption presented an opposite behavior, that is, maximum cement matrix fraction and minimum HDPE fraction.

Polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) was used for the experimental testing. In view that PETG shows viscous deformation which was not considered in the laminate theory, quasi‐static (QS) component of the elastic modulus was used to examine the applicability of laminate theory, which was achieved by extraction of the QS stress response to deformation through stress relaxation and then finite element modeling of the slope for the load–displacement curve before the relaxation. Two analytical approaches were used to examine the laminate theory. One was known as the mechanics of materials approach that considers matrix properties from the intralayer regions, and the other the elasticity model approach that also considers the interlayer regions. The study found that both approaches provided reasonable estimation of the QS elastic modulus but their values were slightly over the measured values.

In this study, we examined the microstructural, mechanical, and thermal properties of composites made from waste micro and nano WC/Co-Cr 86/10-4 powder and a PA66 matrix. PA66 was reinforced with varying ratios of 3, 6, and 10 wt.% WC/Co-Cr 86/10-4.

For this purpose, Ti6Al4V alloy samples were borided for 6 h at a temperature of 1100 °C by the powder-pack boriding process. As a result of boriding, a boride layer consisting of TiB 2 with a thickness of max ∼25 µm and TiB phases with a thickness of max ∼10 µm was obtained on the Ti6Al4V sample surfaces. As a result of the boride layer’s nanoindentation tests carried out using the Berkovich indenter, it was found to have an elastic modulus of 534.255 GPa and a hardness of 36.537 GPa. Wear tests were carried out using the pin-on-disc method under a load of 10 N and with a sliding distance of 1000 m. Whereas the dominant type of wear in non-borided samples was abrasive wear, oxidative mild wear was generally observed in borided samples. In borided samples, as a result of becoming of surface smoother by hard asperities breaking and increasing the actual contact area, the friction coefficients increased.

However, the EBC surface cracking due to the corrosion transformation from YbDS to ytterbium monosilicate (Yb2SiO5, YbMS) during steam cycling is a bottleneck problem for its application. In this paper, four distinct geometric models of EBC with pre-cracks were developed to determine how the undulating and porous structure tuned EBC surface cracking. It was found that the pre-cracks in the valleys of the EBC surface were more likely to propagate than those at the peaks. Wavelength variation on the EBC surface had a more pronounced effect on crack propagation than amplitude variation. The porous structure not only alleviated EBC surface cracking, but also reduced the promotion of crack propagation caused by increasing wavelength.

To this end, an AISI 304 stainless steel subjected to eight passes of ECAP in a 105◦ die at 350◦ C. The evolution of microstructure as a function of induced plastic strain (number of passes) was studied in different length scales using light and scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM). An insight into fine details of dislocation structure was possible via X-ray diffraction profile analysis. Changes in the structure of processed samples were correlated with their mechanical properties as determined by tension tests and microhardness measurements. Light microscopy revealed a shear banded microstructure. STEM observations demonstrated co-existence of three types of grain structure: (a) short elongated grains/subgrains of 71 nm average width formed within the shear band regions, (b) a mixture of coarse (200–350 nm in size) and nanocrystalline (15– 70 nm) equiaxed grains developed outside the shear bands, and (c) nano-twin lamellae of 3–20 nm width inside nanocrystalline grains. XRD peak profile analysis using modified Warren–Averbach approach yielded dislocation density as ρ = 4.71 × 1015 m−2 after eight passes. ECAP-induced changes in the microstructure led to a remarkable increase in yield strength of the alloy (YS=1498 MPa, about 3.5 times the initial amount). At the same time, a moderate ductility of εf = 12% was maintained, primarily due to a large post-necking elongation.

The main findings manifested that increasing PVA fiber content can seriously weaken the workability of SPHFRCC, while the impact of S/B was negligible. Maintaining a steel fiber content of 1.5% and adding PVA fiber from 0 to 0.4% resulted in a decrease in the slump by 12.3% and slump flow diameter by 43.0%. The post-cracking tensile response of SPHFRCC demonstrated strain hardening due to the presence of PVA fibers. Moreover, increasing PVA fiber proportion can tremendously raise the flexural strength and toughness, while the enhancement at an excessively high proportion of PVA fibers would be weakened.

As it is a component of recent use in pavement and its variety, there has yet to be a consensus on the determination of the recycling agent content or the ideal moment of its addition in the recycled asphalt mixture production process. This study aimed to analyze the fracture and moisture performance of asphalt mixtures with the addition of high contents of RAP (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) and two recycling agents (ADCAP WM and residual engine oil) in stages distinct from the production of recycled asphalt mixture (directly to the RAP and directly to the virgin asphalt binder). The recycling agents were added at 12%, 15%, and 18% residual engine oil by mass of RAP and 2%, 2.5%, and 3% of ADCAP WM by the total mass of asphalt binder. The asphalt mixtures were submitted to mechanical tests of tensile strength, resilient modulus, ice and thaw cycles, bending fracture, and fatigue life. The results showed that adding residual engine oil in the asphalt binder enables using up to 75% of RAP. In the case of ADCAP WM additions, identical additions of RAP can be performed. Mixtures with ADCAP WM showed higher consumption of fracture energy, while blends with residual engine oil showed a lower slope of the post-peak curve. Conditioning by the freeze–thaw (F-T) cycle method increased the susceptibility of mixtures to the deleterious effect of water. Statistical analyzes showed that the parameters RAP content, recycling agent, and time of addition of the recycling agent presented adequate significance for the analyzed tests. The maximum RAP content to be applied should be 75%, and adding ADCAP WM directly to the binder showed slightly better results than the other combination.",en

In order to improve the durability of marking paint, a durable hot-melt marking paint was designed by modifying the paint with toughening-agent, rheological agent, and anti-aging agent. The modification mechanism of the modified coating was revealed through TG and FTIR analysis. The low-temperature anti cracking, adhesion, and anti-aging properties of the modified coating were studied by low-temperature bending test, interlaminar shear test and UV aging test. Besides this, the workability of modified coatings was tested onsite. The results showed that the mass loss rate of the rheological agent is 0.15% at 240 °C, the modified coating had good thermal stability within the mixing temperature range of the coating. There was no chemical change between the modifier and the coating, which was a physical blend. The modified marking paint had good fluidity, softening point and drying time, but its compressive strength was slightly reduced. With the increase of the content of the toughener, the low temperature crack resistance and adhesion of the marking coating gradually increase. When the toughener is 5%, the flexural tensile strain of the marking coating beam increased by 79.1%, and the adhesion strength of asphalt concrete increased by 53.4%. The anti-aging agent can shield most of the UV radiation and improve the anti-aging property of the coating by about 30%. The field process validation achieved the expected results. The modifier coating has excellent low temperature crack resistance, adhesion, UV aging resistance, and other properties, and has good application prospects in harsh environment areas.",en

In this work, three kinds of new reticulated ceramic filters were prepared by using spinel (MgAl2O4), ZrO2 and SiC reticulated ceramic filters as preforms, respectively, which were all coated with porous MgO coating on their surfaces. The effect of preform type on the phase composition, microstructures, mechanical properties and interaction with molten steel of the filters was studied.

The microstructure was examined by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The alloys present a microstructure characterized by the α′ lamellar structure in a matrix of the transformed β phase. From the bulk materials, the samples for the tensile tests were prepared and based on the results and the elastic modulus was calculated by deducting the lowest values for the Ti-25Ta alloy. Moreover, a surface alkali treatment functionalization was performed using 10 M NaOH. The microstructure of the new developed films on the surface of the Ti-xTa alloys was investigated by scanning electron microscopy and the chemical analysis revealed the formation of sodium titanate and sodium tantanate along with titanium and tantalum oxides. Using low loads, the Vickers hardness test revealed increased hardness values for the alkali-treated samples. After exposure to simulated body fluid, phosphorus and calcium were identified on the surface of the new developed film, indicating the development of apatite.

One of the main concerns in RMC systems is the potential corrosion of reinforcing steel in structural applications. This study evaluated the feasibility of replacing small proportions of RMC with Portland cement (PC) to promote the passivation of reinforcing steel. Reinforcing steels embedded in RMC with different proportions of PC were investigated by electrochemical measurements and microstructural analysis. Pore solutions extracted from these pastes were evaluated for their chemical compositions. Inclusion of ≥2% PC enabled the passivation of steel. Passive film forming in RMC-PC blends consisted of Fe3O4 and Mg(OH)2, which was thicker than those in pure PC mixes. The formation of passive film was mainly attributed to the increased pH of the pore solution, which reached over 12 in RMC mixes containing only 2% PC.

In this paper, an indirect tensile fatigue test was conducted to study the fatigue-healing performance of fiber-modified asphalt mixtures under different fatigue damage degrees and influencing factors, and the optimal timing of healing was determined based on the degree of fatigue damage. According to the results, due to the rough surface and microwave-absorbing ability of fibers, fiber-modified asphalt mixtures exhibit significantly higher fatigue-healing performance than plain asphalt mixtures. Under the given experimental conditions, the fatigue life of fiber-modified asphalt mixtures can up to three times higher than ordinary asphalt mixtures. Although the enhancement effect of fibers on the fatigue-healing performance of the mixture decreases with the increasing fatigue test repetitions, when the healing timing is 10% of fatigue damage, the fatigue life of the fiber-modified asphalt mixtures after five repetitions is almost equivalent to its initial fatigue life.

To conquer this dilemma, GO/ZK60 composites with bimodal-grain structure were fabricated using powder thixoforming in this work. The results indicate that the grain size and volume fraction of coarse grains (CGs) first decrease as the GO content increases to 0.2 wt.% and then increase again as the content increases to 0.3 wt.%, while the grain size in the fine grains (FGs) almost does not change. Consequently, the strength of the composites is improved with increasing GO content and reaches the peak values at the content of 0.2 wt.%. The composite with 0.1 wt.% GO content exhibits significantly increased tensile yield strength up to 177 ± 2 MPa while maintaining a high elongation of 23.1% ± 2.5%, being equivalent to that of the ZK60 matrix alloy. The increased FGs volume fraction, together with the promoted dislocation accumulation and storage via GO and grain refinement of large-sized CGs lead to the improvement of strain hardening ability, thus rendering the composite an excellent ductility. Furthermore, the deformation of the GO/ZK60 composites occurs progressively from the FGs to the CGs, which is opposite to the status of the milled ZK60 matrix alloy. In view of the microstructure characteristics of the composites, a new complex calculation model was proposed and it could well predict the strength of the bimodal GO/ZK60 composites.

It can provoke nickel allergy and several nickel compounds are classified as carcinogens. Data on the level of exposure of welders have been published repeatedly. However, data on nickel exposure during abrasive work are limited. The aim of this study is to estimate the nickel exposure during abrasive tasks taking into account the nickel content of the material. Data from the German exposure database MEGA are used for the study. The material used is classified according to its nickel content into three groups: less than 5% (mild steel); 5 to 30% (stainless steel); more than 30% (nickel-base alloy). Additionally task and year of measurement are defined as criteria for the statistical evaluations. Percentiles are calculated and, if sufficient data is available, regression methods are used. Between 1975 and 2016, about 6700 measurements from nickel in the inhalable dust fraction in MEGA are related to abrasive tasks. For grinding (wet and dry combined) the 50th percentile was 0.0024 mg Ni/m3 for mild steel, 0.052 mg/m3 for stainless steel and 0.16 mg/m3 for nickel-base alloys during 1990-2006. After 2006 measurements were mainly performed during dry grinding. These measurements resulted in similar exposures. Further results are presented for polishing, milling and drilling.

Despite the success in applicability of these alloy in extreme environments, there is a limited understanding of the deformation modes and the influence of each alloying addition guiding the alloy design strategies that could further enhance the creep strength of these AFA alloys, particularly at temperatures at and above 900⁰C. In this study, we reveal the mechanism underpinning the superior creep performance of AFA alloys that involves suppressing primary carbide formation through minor compositional modification in castable AFA alloys. This approach results in a three-fold increase in creep strength at 900⁰C and 50 MPa. By employing integrated characterization techniques, we analyzed the microstructures of two AFA alloys both before and after the creep process. We discovered that the suppression of primary carbides permits the in-situ clustering of now-available interstitial elements such as C, Si, and O during high-temperature creep. This improves effects related to solute solutionization such as solid solution strengthening and a reduction in stacking fault energy. Moreover, also enabling controlled secondary carbide formation during creep, and where retained tungsten in the solution further provided strengthening.

In this study, two harmonic samples with the same composition of Ti-24Nb-4Zr-8Sn but different microstructures were processed to exhibit different grain size heterogeneities between the core and the shell. Both samples were consolidated from a ball-milled powder using Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) but applying two different sintering times, 1 and 60 min. The grain size heterogeneities were higher for the longer SPS sintering time due to the enhanced grain dimension in the core for 60 min consolidation time. The mechanical behavior of the two materials was studied via a monotonic quasi-static compression test. For both harmonic-structured Ti-24Nb-4Zr-8Sn alloys, a high compressive proof stress of about 1 GPa was detected. The strain-hardening rate was higher for the longer SPS time due to the higher grain size differences between the core and shell. A high dislocation density was detected in both materials after compression deformation (several tens of 1014 m-2). The dislocations tend to form cells and LAGBs during compression.

In the semiconductor industry, whether it is during the surface cleaning steps or the deposition of the protective mask (photosensitive liquid resin that is then cross-linked), the conformity of the deposit of the liquid layer on the patterned surface must be perfect or else the functionality of the targeted electronic component will be compromised. Thus, understanding the surface wetting of these liquids allows the implementation of optimized processes. In this paper, we present a method of indirect wetting characterization of a photoresist based on ultra-high frequency (# GHz) acoustic waves. This resin is a commercial product called GKR 4602 (belonging to the KrF series of positive photoresists), which is coated in two different ways: either directly onto the surface of a patterned silicon wafer, or after application of a solvent, Propylene Glycol Ethyl Ether (PGEE), which then acts as a pre-wetting layer. The patterned wafer, playing the role of electrical insulation (Deep Trench Isolation, DTI) are 200 nm wide, deep trenches with a high aspect ratio (&gt; 50).

Different cementitious (CM) and GP screed mixtures were prepared with varying the liquid-to-binder ratio, binder-to-sand ratio, and type of sand. The fresh and mechanical properties were evaluated by testing the flowability, flow retention, density, setting time, compressive and flexural strengths, drop impact resistance, and pull-off and slant shear bond strengths. Test results showed that the fresh properties of GP screeds were relatively inferior to those of CM counterparts; however, the strength development rates and resistance against the impact of GP screeds were higher, reflecting their capability to accelerate operation works without the use of moist curing that is normally required for cement-based materials. The sand content was increased in GP screeds without compromising the superior mechanical and bond properties. Screed mixes made with crushed sand at a binder-to-sand ratio of 1:7, and the solution-to-binder ratio of 0.60 complied with Category B, while screed mixes made with dune sand at a binder-to-sand ratio of 1:2 and the solution-to-binder ratio of 0.55 complied with Category A of BS 8204.

This study aims to analyze the flammability and vibrational behavior of graphene incorporated epoxy/ramie/glass (ERG) hybrid nanocomposite. The samples were prepared with different weight percentage of graphene (GR) through hand layup method, followed by vacuum bag technique. The samples were analyzed for water intake, porosity, mechanical strength, fractography, vibrational property together with flammability of the material. GR addition depletes water intake and porosity by 11.5% to 5.3% and 6.2% to 2.2%, respectively. It increases hardness and flexural strength up to 25% and 41%, with a reduction in tensile property of the composites. Besides, GR nanocomposites show improved damping properties, owing to stick‐slip mechanism exhibited at epoxy and GR interface. Also, GR addition declines burning rate of ERG at high concentrations since it does not score any grade in flammability test. This work found that the incorporation of GR in ERG composite enhances mechanical properties and decreases water intake. A decrease in the burning rate of the ERG composite could be achieved by incorporating graphene particles, which could be used for structural applications (car door‐panels, ballistic, and aerospace) leading to delay in burning rate of the developed composites when exposed to fire during accidents.",en

In this case, a computer embroidery machine by ZSK type JCZA 0109-550 was used. A technical embroidery with a stitch length of 2 mm was made on the machine. The embroidery was made of flax roving with a linear density of 400 tex. The woven fabric was made of the same flax roving as the embroidery, with a surface mass of 400 g/m2. Composites were then produced from the technical embroidery and woven fabric using the infusion method with epoxy resin. The individual configurations differed from each other in the orientation of the roving in the embroidery samples. Samples for tensile strength and tensile elongation tests consisted of 4 layers, while samples for the DCB test consisted of 6 layers, with the addition of a separating foil between the 3rd and 4th layer. Composites were then subjected to strength tests - tensile strength, tensile elongation and DCB test (Double Cantilever Beam test), on the INSTRON machine. During the action of force along the direction of the fibers, composites containing technical embroidery as reinforcement were characterized by higher strength than composites containing woven fabric as reinforcement. Additionally, embroidery is a barrier to the formation of interlayer cracks. Technical embroidery is made on the basis of Tailored Fiber Placement (TFP) technology. This technology allows optimizing the mechanical values of the composite reinforcement.",en

In particular, it is important to address heatwave damage risk from both technical and policy perspectives because it poses risks to older adults and/or disadvantaged individuals. This study was performed to assess the quantitative effects of two heatwave mitigation measures, cool roofs and cool pavements, in the Jangyumugye district of Gimhae, Republic of Korea. Thermal imaging cameras were used to measure surface temperatures after the installation of these measures; after the installation of cool roofs, indoor temperatures were also measured using temperature measurement data loggers. Then, a survey was conducted to obtain feedback from users of the associated facilities. From August to October 2019, surface temperatures were significantly reduced following the installation of cool roofs and cool pavements. Cool roofs constructed using slabs and panels provided average temperature reductions of 15.5 °C and 11.6 °C, respectively. Cool pavements showed a temperature reduction of ≥4 °C in both parking lot and alley sites. More than 30% of users noticed a reduction in temperature as a result of heatwave measure installation. These results may be used by the city to make informed policy decisions regarding the implementation of heatwave mitigation measures.",en

https://openalex.org/W4323660385,2023,Environmental science,"Clean air in Europe for allIntroduction Ambient air pollution is a major global public health risk factor. There is now broad consensus that exposure to air pollution causes an array of adverse health effects based on evidence from a large scientific literature that has grown exponentially since the mid-1990s.1–4 Air pollution damages most organ systems and is linked to many debilitating diseases, such as asthma, cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, stroke, diabetes, lung cancer, and dementia.5 The Global Burden of Disease study estimated that in 2019 air pollution ranked as the fourth global risk factor for mortality, surpassed only by high blood pressure, tobacco use, and poor diet.6 The European Environment Agency estimated 300,000 premature deaths due to air pollution in the EU-27 in 2020—an unacceptable high air pollution burden.7 Air pollution levels have generally declined over the last several decades in Europe, due largely to successful air quality regulation and subsequent improvements in technology and industry. The current air quality legislation in Europe—the Ambient Air Quality Directive (AAQD) from 2008—set limit values for the annual mean of the air pollutants PM2.5 and NO2 to 25 and 40 µg/m3, respectively.8 These limit values are criticized for being insufficient to protect the health of EU citizens.9,10 The World Health Organization (WHO) released new Air Quality Guidelines (AQG) in September 2021, based on a comprehensive synthesis of the scientific evidence on health effects of air pollution.4 They recommended that annual mean concentrations of PM2.5 and NO2 should not exceed 5 and 10 μg/m3, respectively, demonstrating that serious health effects occur above these values. The health community supports full alignment of EU legislation with the 2021 WHO AQG, indicated by a joint statement which was endorsed by more than 140 medical, public health, and scientific societies and patient organizations.11 The European Commission (EC) published a proposal to revise the AAQD on October 26, 2022.12 The EC also published an accompanying impact assessment, quantifying the expected air pollution concentrations and resulting health- and implementation costs for various policy options.13 The European Parliament and the Council are currently considering the proposal. The proposal includes important steps to achieve cleaner air but falls short of what is ultimately needed to maximize public health benefits, for the reasons explained below. A clear path toward complete alignment with the 2021 WHO AQG is missing The proposed new annual limit values are 10 µg/m3 for PM2.5 and 20 µg/m3 for NO2 to be met across the EU by 2030. While these proposed limit values are stricter than the current ones, they are still twice as high as the 2021 WHO AQG. Other high-income countries are moving toward more stringent standards. The US Environmental Protection Agency, for example, is considering various alternatives for the current annual PM2.5 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) of 12 µg/m3 all the way down to 8 µg/m3.14 The EU may miss the chance to be a role model and a global leader in clean air legislation, if settling for less than full alignment. We call for limit values of 5 and 10 µg/m3 for annual PM2.5 and NO2 by 2030, respectively. The EC proposal fails to outline a clear pathway toward full alignment with the 2021 WHO AQG even after 2030; instead, it proposes a “regular review mechanism to assure that the latest scientific understanding of air quality guides future decisions.” We underscore that the latest scientific understanding supports full alignment with the 2021 WHO AQG. In addition, multiple options for delaying compliance with limit values will lead to a continued unacceptable high air pollution disease burden in Europe. Limit values are needed for ozone The proposal only provides target values and long-term objectives for ozone, instead of legally binding limit values because of the “complex characteristics of its formation in the atmosphere, which complicate the task of assessing the feasibility of complying with strict limit values.” We disagree with this rationale. Ozone is an important air pollutant, with well-established health effects of short-term (“summer smog”) and long-term exposure and therefore commonly used in air pollution burden assessments.15 Ozone levels have decreased much less in the past decades compared to PM2.5 and NO2, and without reduced emissions of precursors, climate change will increase the concentrations of ozone.16 Ozone (as well as other pollutants including PM2.5) also increases the heatwave effect on mortality in Europe.17,18 We further note that the complexities of ozone formation in the atmosphere are present across the world. Other places, including the United States, do have legally binding air quality standards (NAAQS) for ozone. If the United States can do it, the EU should be able to as well. Limit values are key to ensure enforceability of the AAQD, as clearly documented by the 2019 Fitness Check conducted by the EC.19 We propose the use of binding limit values instead of ineffective target values for ozone, and full alignment with the 2021 WHO AQG, including a long-term (warm season) average of 60 µg/m3. Adverse health effects of air pollution are underestimated The systematic reviews underpinning the 2021 WHO AQG were published in 2020 and included health studies available until September 2018.20,21 The summary estimates from these global systematic reviews are used in the European impact assessment to calculate the air pollution mortality burden to inform the various policy options and the proposal. Notably, three very large general population studies funded by the Health Effects Institute were recently published. Those studies examined millions of study participants in the United States, Canada, and Europe and were specifically designed to examine adverse health effects of long-term exposure to low levels of air pollution.22–24 All three studies documented associations between mortality and PM2.5 concentrations below the current and proposed EU limit values and the US NAAQS. Furthermore, the studies documented either a linear (United States), or a supra-linear (Canada and Europe) exposure-response function between long-term exposure to PM2.5 and mortality (supra-linear means a higher effect per additional exposure at low pollutant concentrations than at high concentrations). The European ELAPSE results are particularly relevant for Europe.24 Hence, the EC conducted additional analyses using ELAPSE to estimate the influence of the choice of the exposure-response function on mortality in the impact assessment, partly in response to our suggestions.25 The attributable mortality estimates were 40% higher for PM2.5 and more than double for NO2 using the ELAPSE exposure-response function compared with the estimates from the WHO systematic reviews, all other things kept equal.13 Furthermore, only a limited set of morbidity outcomes were included in the impact assessment, and for PM2.5 only. Hence, we conclude that the EC impact assessment substantially underestimates the burden of disease due to air pollution. This is especially concerning, as the choice of policy options and the proposed new limit values depended on the net benefit of mitigation actions (benefits from health gains versus costs for implementation of measures). Many potential policy options and actions are missing from the feasibility scenario The maximum technically feasible reduction scenario for projecting future air pollution concentrations considers all available technical measures, irrespective of costs. This assessment shows that, by the year 2030, reaching air pollutant concentration levels that fully align with the 2021 WHO AQG may not be possible for large parts of sampling points in the EU (71% for PM2.5).13 We note, however, that feasibility is very much related to political will. While technical measures play an important role, other potential realistic abatement options are largely ignored. These include, for example, low or zero emission zones, low-traffic neighborhoods, improving public transportation, promoting active transportation, and incentivizing healthy dietary choices through political action at the production, transport and consumer level. Moreover, accelerated shifts to cleaner fuels and electrification, effective local measures such as coal and biomass combustion bans, and other local or national measures are missing from the feasibility scenario. The EC conducted a conservative impact assessment that underestimates the health benefits, and one that is based on an incomplete picture of what is possible, leading to a rather unambitious proposal. Despite these shortcomings, the main message of the impact assessment is clear: the health benefits outweigh by far (a factor 6–18) the implementation costs of air quality actions with the largest net benefit (EUR 38 billion) for the policy option of complete alignment with the 2021 WHO AQG by 2030.13 More effort needed to decrease inequalities in health burdens from air pollution Although air pollution affects all people, certain groups are especially vulnerable and more likely to experience adverse health effects, including pregnant women, children, elderly, chronic disease patients, and those with lower socioeconomic status.26 Furthermore, marginalized groups are more likely to live in air pollution hotspot areas, resulting in environmental injustice and additional health disparities.27,28 The United States has begun to address the challenges of addressing air pollution-health inequalities through the NAAQS process, where they required additional monitors to be placed in marginalized communities.14 We urge the EC to put more emphasis on considering inequalities and recommend using monitoring or modeling to assess whether disparities in exposure are reduced in the future. We note that the current proposed complementary average exposure reduction obligations for long-term PM2.5 and NO2 will not adequately protect marginalized groups because only urban background monitors are proposed for the calculations. Furthermore, the average exposure is calculated at the regional level (NUTS1 areas), which is too coarse to pick up relevant exposure disparities. We propose that the average exposure reduction obligations should be population-weighted and include hotspot monitor data (e.g., busy roads), ideally augmented with additional monitors to be placed specifically in hotspot areas and in marginalized communities. We recommend using smaller geographical areas (e.g., NUTS2) with clear assignments as to which authorities are responsible for meeting the average exposure reduction obligations, and we emphasize that those obligations should only be complementary to limit values. Be wary of the deduction of “natural” source contributions Similar to the current AAQD, the proposal allows for deductions of “natural” source contributions to exceedances of limit values or exposure reduction obligations. This includes deductions due to wildfires and long-range transported particles from sand and dust storms. Scientific evidence demonstrates that air pollution from those “natural” sources is also harmful to human health, and the vast majority of the health studies underpinning the 2021 WHO AQG do not distinguish between air pollution from “natural” sources versus anthropogenic sources.4,29,30 Furthermore, the contribution of “natural” sources is expected to increase due to climate change. We propose to limit the possibility of deduction of “natural” sources. Conclusions We call for more ambition and a clear path in the AAQD toward complete alignment with the 2021 WHO AQG for PM2.5, NO2 and ozone by 2030. Specifically, we call for limit values of 5 and 10 µg/m3 for annual PM2.5 and NO2, respectively, with the addition of a limit value of 60 µg/m3 for long-term (warm season) ozone. More effort is needed to decrease inequalities in health burdens from air pollution since the current proposed average exposure reduction obligations will not adequately protect marginalized communities. We further caution to be wary of delays in complying with limit values and of the deduction of “natural” source contributions, which are only expected to increase due to climate change. The robust and stronger associations with mortality and morbidity at very low levels of air pollution underscore the large untapped potential for additional health benefits in Europe and should provide impetus for the European Commission, European Parliament, and the Council to be bold in its ambitions. Moreover, we encourage governments, local authorities and other bodies to continue to exert effort to improve air quality, even if the current and proposed EU limit values have been met.

Yet, soil health is under threat by overuse, climate change, salinization, erosion, compaction, nutrient depletion, contamination with toxic heavy metals or pesticides, overgrazing, and human assisted migration of soil-borne pests. Many agricultural practices that are proposed to be sustainable provide relatively small improvements and merely slow down the rate of degradation, which means that soils remain endangered. Thus, not only improvements in soil quality and fertility, but also a restoration of the soil food web, locking-up carbon in soil organic matter, improving water holding capacity, and diminishing soilborne pest outbreaks need to be addressed. To establish a representative database of soil factors changes induced by various agriculture management as well as factors reflecting local soil conditions and climate, seven long term experiments were sampled for physical, chemical and biological soil characteristics. Those include also the community composition and quantity of microorganisms, namely bacteria, archaea and fungi, which seem to be the most promising soil bioindicators. Thus, the main goal of the study was to combine the soil factors representing soil management and relate them to soil microbial communities for estimation of changes in microbial phylogenetic and functional diversity, which will be proposed as indicators of soil health.

https://openalex.org/W4376651013,2023,Environmental science,"In the literature: May 2023Resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors (MAPKi) across BRAF-V600-mutant melanoma is a common event. In general, tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance is related to concomitant molecular alterations, such as mutations or gene amplification of parallel pathways or downstream effectors. Nevertheless, there is a limited understanding on those mechanisms, such as genomic instability pathways, causing rapid resistance in patients treated with a molecular-matched approach.1Nazarian R. Shi H. Wang Q. et al.Melanomas acquire resistance to B-RAF(V600E) inhibition by RTK or N-RAS upregulation.Nature. 2010; 468: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar In a relevant article recently published in Cancer Discovery, Dharanipragada et al.2Dharanipragada P. Zhang X. Liu S. et al.Blocking genomic instability prevents acquired resistance to MAPK inhibitor therapy in melanoma.Cancer Discov. 2023; 13: 880-909Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar demonstrated the role of chromothripsis in causing resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors in melanoma patients. Chromothripsis is a mutational process by which up to thousands of clustered chromosomal rearrangements occur in a single event in localized and confined genomic regions in one or a few chromosomes, and is known to be involved in both cancer and congenital diseases. The authors provide insights into the underlying genomic instability processes that generate clonal diversification in advanced cutaneous melanoma. To address the evolution of MAPKi resistance in melanoma, whole-genome sequencing across three tumor cohorts was carried out, including pretreatment samples matched with those after resistance was acquired from patients with BRAFV600 melanoma deriving from multiple organ sites, as well as acquired MEKi-resistant melanoma and untreated BRAFV600 and NRAS melanoma. The authors demonstrated that MAPKi-acquired resistance was related to specifically amplified resistance-driver, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), and homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes via complex genomic rearrangements (CGRs) and extrachromosomal DNAs (ecDNA). In particular, they identified chromothripsis, as well as ecDNAs and CGRs, as highly recurrent and pervasive genomic single variants in MAPKi-naive/sensitive and acquired MAPKi-resistant BRAFV600 melanoma and NRAS-mutant patient-derived xenograft (PDX). Through in vivo and in vivo analyses, using human melanoma cell lines and PDXs, they tested the efficacy and dissected the mechanisms of blocking genomic instability via targeting of NHEJ-mediated double-stranded DNA break repair to prevent the evolution of acquired MAPKi resistance in both BRAFV600- and NRAS-mutant melanoma. To overcome treatment resistance, the authors suggest the possibility of combining a DNA-PKi and MAPKi based on the fact that DNA-PKi suppresses NHEJ, which is necessary for the efficient formation of genomic instability. Moreover, MAPKi is potentially an inducer of DNA damage repair deficiency. It has been shown that MAPKi can induce DNA damage in early drug-tolerant persister subpopulations. The therapy could cause a chain reaction activating reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced mutagenesis and alterations in DNA single-stranded break. All processes may activate chromothripsis and ecDNA/CGR generation. The results regarding ecDNAs and CGRs driving acquired MAPKi resistance advance the concept that multiple resistance mechanisms, genetic and epigenetic, as well as direct and indirect, are responsible for clinically acquired resistance. Cancer is an age-related disease, however, how molecular alterations in tumors differ among patients of different ages remains poorly understood. Several aging-related processes might contribute to creating a fertile ground for cancer.3Chatsirisupachai K. Lagger G. de Magalhaes J.P. Age-associated differences in the cancer molecular landscape.Trends Cancer. 2022; 8: 962-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (0) Google Scholar Furthermore, patients with luminal breast cancer are at risk of metastatic relapse for decades after primary tumor, due to dormant disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) reawakening at secondary sites. Turrell et al.,4Turrell F.K. Orha R. Guppy N.J. et al.Age-associated microenvironmental changes highlight the role of PDGF-C in ER+ breast cancer metastatic relapse.Nat Cancer. 2023; 4: 468-484Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar working at the Cancer Research Institute in London, published a relevant article in Nature Cancer where they used an interesting preclinical model with syngeneic models of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer to demonstrate how microenvironment changes due to aging or fibrotic injury support proliferation and outgrowth of DTCs. They described how DTCs display a dormant phenotype in young mice but accelerate metastatic outgrowth in an aged or fibrotic microenvironment. They characterized a mouse mammary tumor cell line and demonstrated that primary tumors grew comparably irrespective of mouse age, but only single DTCs or small tumor cell clusters were present in the lungs from young mice, whereas lungs from aged mice (or lung fibrosis) showed a significantly increased metastatic burden. Based on these findings, they carried out RNA sequencing showing several genes associated with fibroblast activation and development of fibrosis that have been related to promote metastatic colonization. Intriguingly, the authors demonstrated a significant up-regulation of platelet-derived growth factor C (PDGF-C) expression in aged mouse lungs and fibrotic lungs. The authors confirmed that low-level PDGF-C expression in ER+ DTC aids their survival but is insufficient for generation of a metastasis-permissive niche in healthy young lungs. Conversely, in aged or fibrotic lungs, the activated PDGF-C stroma supports metastatic outgrowth. Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of PDGF receptor α with imatinib, but also with a specific antibody, significantly reduced the increased metastatic outgrowth observed in aged mice. These results underline that inhibition of PDGF-C signaling could be an opportunity to limit metastatic relapse in ER+ breast cancers. This work supports the evidence describing a role for the aged stroma, including immune cells, fibroblasts and extracellular matrix, in promoting tumorigenesis. The immune and fibroblast compartment can regulate the balance between DTC dormancy and metastatic outgrowth. A very interesting paper published recently in Nature Medicine gives some deep insights into the role of some codon-specific KRAS mutations in defining the effect of a fluoropyrimidine such as trifluridine/tipiracil.5van de Haar J. Ma X. Ooft S.N. et al.Codon-specific KRAS mutations predict survival benefit of trifluridine/tipiracil in metastatic colorectal cancer.Nat Med. 2023; 29: 605-614Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar It reports on some evidence indicating that patients with advanced colon cancer bearing KRAS mutations in codon 12 do not benefit from treatment with single agent trifluridine/tipiracil in the refractory setting. The methodology used is very robust and follows the best recommendations for biomarkers discovery. The authors approached first an exploratory phase in a small test or discovery cohort of 37 patients, defining first the criterion of interest for further analysis. In this case, it was defined as any molecular variant or mutation which was found in five or more patients. At this initial step, patients treated with trifluridine/tipiracil and presenting any of the KRASG12 mutations, showed worse overall survival compared with those not presenting such molecular alteration. In a second step, as an external validation cohort, the authors collected almost 1000 patients treated also with trifluridine/tipiracil in a real-world setting in a series of centers across Italy and the UK. The investigators took the advantage of the fact that RAS and BRAF mutations are universally determined as per standard of care in all patients with advanced colon cancer before receiving any type of chemotherapy. In this validation cohort, patients with KRASG12 mutations had worse overall survival than other molecular subtypes, confirming the findings already observed in the small discovery cohort. Interestingly, patients with tumors bearing codon 13 KRAS mutations did enjoy significantly better survival than those mutated in codon 12 KRAS. In a third step, the authors could analyze again their hypothesis in those patients participating in the RECOURSE trial,6Mayer R.J. van Cutsen E. Falcone A. et al.Randomized trial of TAS-102 for refractory metastatic colorectal cancer.N Engl J Med. 2015; 372: 1909-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar which led to the approval of trifluridine/tipiracil for patients with advanced colon cancer refractory to previous chemotherapy, as validation in an independent cohort. Moreover, the authors were also able to characterize some isogenic cell lines and patient-derived organoids to model this finding. The presence of KRASG12 mutations in these models was linked to a reduced suppression of trifluridine/tipiracil-induced DNA damage. The consequence of these findings, demonstrating that patients with KRASG12 mutations do not get a prolonged survival when receiving treatment with trifluridine/tipiracil, is of practical importance and implies avoiding an unactive drug in a very specific molecularly determined population of advanced colon cancer patients, which is ∼28% of all of them. This recommendation means a step forward in personalized precision medicine for advanced colon cancer. This action is easy to implement, however, because KRAS mutational status is already determined in routine clinical practice.

https://openalex.org/W4387472708,2023,Environmental science,"Issue highlights—September 2023[Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] Despite the reality that my entire career has been spent devoted to flow cytometry, it is undeniable to me that the gold standard remains an image of the cell, and when visualized within tissue, the architectural relationships between cells. Thus my keen interest in bringing the Amnis technology into my research laboratory years ago and my current enthusiasm for the cell-imaging capacities of more recent technologies such as those from Becton-Dickinson (Cell-View), ThermoFisher (Attune CytPix) and other imaging flow cytometers currently or soon available. In this issue I am therefore extremely interested in Cyclic Analysis of Single-Cell Subsets and Tissue Territories (CASSATT) which identifies scanned slide images through multiple staining rounds, segments nuclei and assesses marker expression on each detected cell (Brockman et al., 2023). Cyclic immunochemistry (cycIHC) exploits multiple rounds of immunostaining and imaging for mapping and locating cells of interest with the speed and simplicity of brightfield microscopy, making the collection of entire tissue sections and slides possible. CASSATT employs registered scanned slide images across all rounds of staining, segments individual nuclei, and measures marker expression on each detected cell. It further explores the spatial relationships between cell populations and the odds of interaction frequencies between cell populations within tissue regions, helping to identify cells that interact or do not interact. In this report, a test dataset of six glioblastoma tissue sections were cyclically stained for eight biomarkers for a total of 48 scanned slide images. The authors describe an efficient workflow that provided answers to questions commonly encountered in discovery research in tissue specimens, such as the overall abundance of cells of interest within a tissue section as well as whether groups of cells were in close proximity. CASSATT gathered together and streamlined all steps necessary to produce single cell expression information from cycIHC datasets and did so utilizing an open source environment. In addition, CASSATT systematically analyzed the spatial relationships between cell populations and via unsupervised algorithms, identified clusters of cell niches. The persistence of measurable residual disease (MRD) is a strong indicator for adverse outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and has been shown to be a valid surrogate marker for disease-free survival and overall survival, irrespective of patients' age, AML subtype, sample type, time of MRD assessment and MRD detection method (Short et al., 2020). Other hematopoietic malignancies such as B- and plasma cell lineages also benefit from MRD diagnostic assays (Chen et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2023; McMillan et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023). In a study by Wang et al. (2023) their experience working under CLSI HL62 guidelines and FDA IDE (investigational device exemption) approval in the validation of a 12-color AML MRD flow cytometry MRD assay is shared, including the details of panel design, analysis and interpretation. Prior to their recent cytometer upgrade to 12-marker capacity permitting more expansive testing, these investigators utilized an eight-marker AML MRD test designed to discriminate between normal and abnormal myelomonocytic precursors using analytical approaches combining the detection of leukemia-associated immunophenotypes (LAIP) and/or the identification of deviation from normal (DfN) methods. The eight-color assay was cross correlated with molecular testing, clinical outcomes, and resulted in multiple publications (Ouyang et al., 2015, 2016; Xu et al., 2017). In the current study, the assay accuracy was assessed by testing known positive and negative samples and correlating with the results of molecular genetic testing and follow-up bone marrow examination. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were validated to a level between 0.01% and 0.1%, dependent on the numbers of cells evaluated and the degree of deviation from normal phenotypes. Assay linearity, precision and carry over studies were found to be acceptable. The clinical validity of the assay was tested in 61 patients in order that “trueness” could be determined by correlating with concurrent molecular genetic testing and or follow-up bone marrow examination results; the clinical test concordance was 93%, specificity 98% and sensitivity 83%. Ultimately, the most challenging aspects of the assay involved discerning differences between pre-leukemic cells (persistent clonal hematopoiesis) or underlying myelodysplastic clones from AML MRD with immunophenotypic switch or subclone selection, highlighting the need for further characterization of abnormal blasts bearing the potential for relapse. Processing as many monoclonal antibodies as possible in one staining tube in the clinical flow cytometry laboratory has been an on-going aspiration over my entire professional career. It is not as much of the “flow-geek” in me that wants such capacity but rather my contention that such practice clearly provides better medical care to our patients. This is especially true in the diagnosis of hematologic malignancies, where I contend that the tumors “…do not read the same books and journals” that we do related to linage markers, but rather do whatever they can to obfuscate their lineages and confuse us with their “unfaithful” antigenic co-expressions. The more markers we can apply to such malignancies, along with built in internal positive and negative controls (provided by comingling normal cells), the better diagnosticians we become. These are not the only advantages of minimizing the number of staining tubes, in that when samples are pauci-cellular, more diagnostic information also becomes further available utilizing the least number of tubes or wells cells are processed in. The more analytic power the clinical flow cytometry laboratory can harness, the more flexibility we can offer and better questions we can ask such as those described just above related to MRD as well as so many other areas (Estevam et al., 2021; Quirós-Caso et al., 2022; Shameli & Roshan, 2022; Sanjabi & Lear, 2021). Such hardware, reagents and software already exists in our research flow cytometry laboratories; we are all left waiting for these to move fully into the clinical realm, and to see advances in this area brings us all closer to far better laboratory practice. In the submission of Hammerich et al. (2023), we learn of the application of a three-laser spectral flow cytometer demonstrating the analysis of a 31-marker clinically oriented testing panel. The standard 3-laser Aurora utilized by this group resolved 31 fluorochromes excited off a 405, 488, and 640 nm lasers. All fluorochromes and titrated antibodies used in the study were commercially available simplifying modification of the panel and facilitating replacement of markers of interest with others that might be more appropriate. In fact since not all detectors were utilized in this study, it is possible to hypothesize that in the future a few more conjugated antibodies might possibly expand the breadth of this platform's analytic capacity. In conclusion, I find this to be a great moment in clinical flow diagnostics… except of course that I want at least one if not two- to -three more lasers in the instrument than those discussed in this article . It is my privilege and honor to usher into our Journal a new type of peer-reviewed submission we refer to as the “Best Practice” category. While presently new to our Journal pages, in past years such informative pieces in the form of numbered Modules have been available to the clinical flow laboratory community, originating from our own ICCS Quality and Standards Committee. The current submission from Devitt et al. (2023) underscores the importance of flow cytometric assay validation which provides confidence that such assays yield reliable results that can be trusted by clinical caregivers in their determining critical medical decisions. For example, the authors provide our readership much needed descriptions, explanations and distinguishing characteristics of both IVD (in vitro diagnostic) or LDT (laboratory developed) tests. IVD tests are developed by manufacturers who optimize, validate, and submit such assays to a regulatory body, such as the FDA. The regulatory body approves the validation and clears it for clinical use permitting the manufacturer to sell the assay to laboratories for testing patient samples. Laboratories must follow the manufacturer's described standard operating procedures and verify that they can reproduce the manufacturer's performance specifications in their lab. In contrast to IVD tests, Devitt et al. (2023) focusses on LDT assays which are developed, optimized and validated in individual laboratories using that specific laboratories equipment, reagents and staff. There is currently no requirement for an outside regulatory body to approve LDTs in the United States, although federal legislation to change this paradigm (VALID act) has been suggested and such potential changes must be closely monitored by many impacted medical societies. The laboratory must validate performance specifications unique to their in-house-developed assay. Once validated, the laboratory can perform the assay on patient samples; however, tests may not be sold to another facility. Any change to an IVD assay that deviates from the manufacturer instructions may render the test an LDT and require validation. The authors continue with other aspects of LDTs such as describing their reporting structures (quantitative, semi- quantitative, and qualitative or mixed) and providing examples of each. The concepts of testing accuracy, precision, limits of detectability, stability along with helpful examples of each concept round out this incredibly helpful reference document. I trust this is a great start to our Journal publishing's future contributions in this new category! Four “Letters to the Editor” generally related to hematologic malignancy round off this issue of Clinical Cytometry (Li et al., 2023; Martin-Moro & Garcia-Vela, 2023; Panda et al., 2023a, 2023b). With that I would like to thank all who submit articles to our Journal, as well as our splendid Associate Editors and talented Editorial Board who are involved in the important task of reviewing submitted articles. Additionally, hats off to our friends at Wiley, the ICCS and ESCCA. And a special thanks to Doris Regal with whom I have the pleasure of working with in making this Journal a success!",en

This is particularly true in the semi-arid Sahelian region, where these resources remain largely unassessed, and little is known about their number, size and quality. Remote sensing monitoring methods remain a promising tool to address these issues at the large scale, especially in areas where field data are scarce. Thanks to technological advances, current remote sensing systems provide data for regular monitoring over time and offer a high spatial resolution, up to 10 metres. &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;western&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;justify&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span lang=&amp;quot;en-GB&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Several water detection methods have been developed, many of them using spectral information to differentiate water surfaces from soil, through thresholding on water indices (MNDWI for example), or classifications by clustering. These methods are sensitive to optical reflectance variability and are not straight forwardly applicable to regions, such as the Sahel, where the lakes and their environment are very diverse. Particularly, the presence of aquatic vegetation is an important challenge and source of error for many of the existing algorithms and available databases. &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;western&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;justify&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span lang=&amp;quot;en-GB&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Deep learning, a subset of machine learning methods for training deep neural networks, has emerged as the state-of-the-art approach for a large number of remote sensing tasks.

EV drivers are frequently unable to charge their vehicle successfully when they arrive at a charging station, a problem that threatens to undermine confidence in EVs and slow EV adoption. These problems originate in a complex ‘open’ ecosystem where vehicle and charging technologies are still maturing, challenging unit economics make it hard for charge point operators to invest adequately in maintenance, and many faults are difficult to diagnose remotely. The substantial investments into EV charging being made by the US government threaten to be squandered if the reliability of existing and new charging stations isn’t improved. Deliberate improvement effort between EV charging stakeholders is needed, not just performance standards and hope.",en

https://openalex.org/W4315752787,2023,Environmental science,"Industrial applications of selected <i>JFS</i> articlesTwo reports in the news, recently, indicate both hope and despair for the future: fusion and famine. Researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's (LLNL) National Ignition Facility held a press conference to announce the first-ever demonstration of fusion ignition. According to the press release, this marks a potentially world-changing breakthrough for fusion energy and a key initial step in a decades-long quest for limitless clean energy. The scientists announced performing an inertial confinement fusion experiment at the facility just after 1 a.m. on December 5 that produced more energy from the self-sustaining fusion reaction than they put in to create the reaction: a condition known as ignition. While optimism reigned for the event, LLNL Director Kim Budil cautioned there are still “significant hurdles” and engineering challenges to solve before the commercialization of fusion energy becomes a reality, such as the ability to reproduce ignition many times per minute and making fusion reactions simpler and more efficient. “I think it's moving into the foreground and, probably with concerted effort and investment, a few decades of research on the underlying technologies could put us in a position to build a power plant,” Budil said. For more, see the LLNL press release: https://www.llnl.gov/news/shot-ages-fusion-ignition-breakthrough-hailed-one-most-impressive-scientific-feats-21st. On the other hand, a record-breaking drought in the Horn of Africa has affected half the population of Somalia. The United Nations says if more aid does not arrive soon, Somalia will suffer its worst famine in half a century. More than 40 million people are struggling with hunger fueled by a record drought in the Horn of Africa that has killed more than 10 million animals. For more, read the VOA news report: https://www.voanews.com/a/somalia-inches-toward-famine-amid-extreme-drought-/6876319.html. Both are linked to the issue and challenges of climate change. It is obvious that extreme weather events are becoming more likely. These events emphasize the need to transition to a zero-carbon future. As mentioned at the press conference, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, “Fusion could generate four times more energy per kilogram of fuel than fission (used in nuclear power plants) and nearly four million times more energy than burning oil or coal.” “It moves us closer to the possibility of zero carbon abundant fusion energy powering our society,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm at the press conference. Meanwhile, food technologists and food scientists continue to work on new uses for alternative crops, extending the quality of foods during storage, food safety and other ways of improving our food supply. Highlights of such research in this issue include tailoring texture of extruded meat alternatives; improving fresh cheese shelf-life through hyperbaric storage, screening new japonica rice varieties; astringency and phenolic composition in table grapes; and using silkworm pupae as a protein source in pasta. According to these researchers, health, environment, and animal welfare concerns are creating a growing movement toward plant-based meat. Pea protein isolate and concentrate have become popular ingredients for textured plant protein. According to the group, understanding of the role of starch and fiber in the structuring of textured pea protein could lead to use of legume flours and co-products of protein isolation to reduce cost and increase sustainability and nutrition of meat alternatives while providing desired attributes. The overall objective of this study was to understand texturization of pea protein isolate (PPI) using low moisture extrusion, and to investigate protein interactions, functionality, and cross-linking with the inclusion of different levels of pea fiber (5%−15%) and different types of starch-containing legume flours (20% chickpea flour or pea flour). PPI/legume flour raw formulations had 18%−27% lower water absorption capacity (WAC) compared to the PPI control. However, WAC increased by 8%−16% with the addition of pea fiber to a PPI/legume flour control. Bulk density and water-holding-capacity trends due to these porosity and layering effects impacted the instrumental texture characteristics of ground hydrated product, including hardness. The researchers say that the results indicate the use of legume flours and fiber can allow flexibility in targeting specific qualities while reducing costs and increasing sustainability of plant-based meats. P 57–71 This study points to increased microbial stability of fresh cheeses when stored under hyperbaric storage without temperature control, leading possibly to an increased shelf-life of up to 60 days. According to the researchers, this kind of new food preservation strategy may be suitable for longer transportation of foods, where energy may not be handily and widely available, while additionally contributing to increased shelf-life and safety. Also, hyperbaric storage could be applied throughout the food storage, improving shelf-life with a lower carbon footprint than refrigeration. The changes in microbiological, physiochemical, and textural properties in fresh cheeses made from either cow or goat milk were observed under hyperbaric storage (HS, 50–100 MPa) at room temperature and compared with refrigerated storage under normal atmospheric pressure for 60 days. A compression effect occurred during HS/RT, resulting in higher whey loss, reduction in moisture content, and textural changes. Such changes tended to decrease over time, to values closer to the initial ones, with hardness values at the 60th day of storage at 75/RT similar to those observed for refrigeration on the 7th day and 1.4-fold higher than those observed at 100/RT. Overall, HS/RT reduced the microbial population load during storage (≥5 log units in some cases), with minimal effects on most of the evaluated quality parameters. These results point to a considerable shelf-life extension of HS fresh cheeses, without temperature control, pinpointing HS as a more sustainable preservation strategy than refrigeration, with great potential for industrial application. P 391–402 Rice (Oryza sativa) is one of the most widely cultivated cereals globally. As the researchers note, rice is a relatively cheap source of nutrients, and demand is rising sharply, with 112 million metric tons of rice expected to be produced by 2035 to feed a growing global population. As the largest food crop in China, rice accounts for about 40% of China's food; while its total yield and sown area rank first and second globally, respectively. According to the researchers, improving rice-eating quality is a goal of rice breeding, and cultivar selection works to ensure rice yield. In this study, to advance the breed of new superior japonica rice varieties, the differences in the rice quality, processing characteristics, and flavor characteristics between 12 newly-bred varieties were compared to one commercial variety. The results indicated that one variety, H2-42 rice, had better apparent quality, processing characteristics, and aroma compounds. Therefore, H2-42 has the potential for identification and promotion. The results from this study will provide data support for the cultivation, application, and quality improvement of high-quality rice varieties. In addition, it gives new ideas and methods for studying rice eating quality. P 133–146 These researchers explored a novel vacuum sublimation–rehydration thawing method to ensure better quality of thawed meat but also to maximize the thawing rate and minimize the energy consumption of the system. They say this can provide a new idea and reference for the development of new high efficiency thawing equipment. They developed multiparameter and multi-objective coupling optimizations for a new proposed vacuum sublimation–rehydration thawing (VSRT) process. In the sublimation and rehydration stages, there existed an optimal region in the response surface to achieve a better value for the single and comprehensive objectives. Their results indicated that the comprehensive performance of the VSRT system reached the best state. P 259–272 This research explored the effect of barley-to-wheat ratio in malt blends on protein composition and physicochemical characteristics of wort and beer. Results indicate that the addition of wheat malt can significantly improve the soluble protein of wort and the final beer, and it can provide more > 2.2 kDa protein in final beer, which is mainly derived from the raw wheat malt but also includes some protein produced in the fermentation process. The addition of wheat malt significantly improved the concentration of 2.2−15 and > 15 kDa protein, but a higher percentage of addition ratio can decrease the foam stability of the beer. Their results indicate that modifying barley-to-wheat ratios can control the protein content and types of wheat beer, improve the quality of wheat beer, and expand and popularize the application of wheat in the beer industry. P 193–203 Phenolic compounds and their derivatives play a major role in the intensity and characteristics of grape (Vitis vinifera) astringency. These researchers investigated the relationship between phenolic composition and astringency of six commercial table grape varieties (two of each: white skinned, red skinned, and black skinned). Thirty phenolic compounds were identified among the six varieties. Principal component analysis of the phenolic profiles revealed that the intensity of astringency of grape skin was positively correlated with catechin, epicatechin, and proanthocyanidin dimers B1, B2, and B3. This study provided a better understanding of the relationships between phenolic composition and table grape astringency and highlighted a potential metabolic marker that could be used as a predictor for the complex astringency sensory attributes of table grape berries. P 447–461 Silkworm (Bombyx mori) pupae are recognized as novel nutritionally valuable food. These researchers consider their use in pasta-making. They investigated making spaghetti-shaped pasta supplemented with silkworm derivatives (10% db) to add protein while upcycling a side stream from the silk industry. The group's principal objective was to assess the cooking quality (i.e., imbibition kinetics, cooking loss) and texture of pasta supplemented with defatted silkworm powder or with its aqueous protein extract. Besides cooking behavior and quality, the group looked at the structural roles of the pasta protein network played by silkworm powder and extract. The former behaves as a structural thickener, while the second provides a steric hindrance effect with consequent different cooking performances. They concluded that silkworm pupae flour can be applied for pasta fortification to increase the protein daily intake of people in an easy and practical way. P 341–355",en

The problem that is often experienced by coffee farmers is the decline in coffee production due to climate. The adverse effect of climate change can be overcome through mitigation by implementing shade plants. The saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil is defined as the movement of water in a porous medium in a saturated state. By measuring hydraulic conductivity, it can determine the ability of the soil to conduct water and see the movement of water in the soil. The highest value of saturated hydraulic conductivity at a depth of 0-20 cm was found in coffee plants with sengon shade at 31.02 cm hour-1. The highest value of saturated hydraulic conductivity at a depth of 20-40 cm was found in coffee plants with the shade of Dadap plants, which was 56.67 cm hour-1, included in the fast category. Differences in shade and soil depth in coffee fields affect the value of the saturated hydraulic conductivity.

https://openalex.org/W4386449764,2023,Geography,"Dietary 14C reservoir effects and the chronology of prehistoric burials at Sakhtysh, central European RussiaAbstract We present the first robust radiocarbon ( 14 C) chronology for prehistoric burial activity at Sakhtysh, in European Russia, where nearly 180 inhumations attributed to Lyalovo and Volosovo pottery‐using hunter‐gatherer‐fishers represent the largest known mortuary populations of these groups. Past attempts at 14 C dating were restricted by poor preservation and limited understanding of diet and dietary 14 C reservoir effects (DREs). We obtained 32 new AMS (Accelerator Mass Spectrometry) 14 C dates on human petrous bones. Dietary stable isotopes (δ 13 C, δ 15 N) for all AMS‐dated human samples allow us to propose a novel DRE correction model, using differences in 14 C, δ 13 C and δ 15 N from bones and teeth of the same individuals to predict DREs of up to c.900 14 C years. Our chronological model for 40 individuals dates Lyalovo burials to the early 5 th millennium cal BC, and Volosovo burials to the mid‐4 th to early 3 rd millennium. It reveals a previously unrecognised shift in the Volosovo subsistence economy at c.3300 cal BC, coinciding with a reorientation of trade networks, and shows that the last burial at Sakhtysh was the only one in a crouched position, which coincided with the beginning of Fatyanovo practices, the regional expression of the Yamnaya/Corded Ware expansion.",en

While archaeological research from Byblos suggests that the city prospered under Roman rule, it was mostly overshadowed by its coastal neighbors, Beirut and Tyre. In this paper we analyze the biodistances within and between three contemporary (1st–4th century AD) human skeletal assemblages from Byblos, Beirut, and Tyre. Dental measurements and nonmetric traits were recorded on 97 individuals. Both individual- and group-level analyses were performed; the individual-level analysis was based on PERMANOVA/PERMDISP using Gower distances, whereas the group-level analysis was based both on Gower distances and a Mahalanobis-type distance for mixed continuous and binary data. The results showed that Tyre and Beirut were more heterogeneous, that is, they exhibited higher intra-assemblage distances; this pattern was more prominent in Tyre. The inter-assemblage biodistances supported a relative proximity between Tyre and Beirut, followed by some affinity between Beirut and Byblos. In contrast, Tyre and Byblos were very divergent. The historical sources and literary texts support the idea that Beirut and Tyre, as key Roman colonies and commercial hubs in the Eastern Mediterranean, had high levels of mobility when compared to other coastal cities such as Byblos. Although more research is required, the integration of biodistance data with historical narratives has wide-reaching implications, especially in regions of the Eastern Mediterranean where human bioarchaeological research is actively developing.",en

Building on scientific analysis of ceramics from the seasonally inhabited Cyclops Cave, the present study examines in detail 39 sherds from the permanently settled site of Agios Petros on the adjacent island of Kyra Panagia, using a combination of thin section petrography, geochemistry, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The two ceramic assemblages have been directly compared, revealing close similarities and differences that provide insights into the relationship between the neighbouring sites and their functions.

To undertake this research, we designed an analytical strategy combining spatial analysis, microstratigraphic analysis through soil micromorphology and physical-chemical analyses of bulk soil samples, and archaeobotanical analyses including palynology, phytoliths and geochemical analysis. All this has allowed us to obtain data of interest for the reconstruction of agrarian land use and to establish a methodological basis for developing future research. This high-resolution, multiscalar, and multianalytical approach pursues to characterise these archaeological contexts to singularize intensive agricultural practices developed in terraced field. The creation of this Roman peasant landscape is related to a specific models of socioeconomic organisation of agricultural work based on the household and its workforce as a determining vector in agrarian intensification.",en

https://openalex.org/W4320922448,2023,Geography,"The basics of peer reviewPeer review is the process of vetting scientific manuscripts by qualified and unbiased referees for dissemination to the research community and to enhance science. The origin of peer review is unclear, but it is almost as old as publication of scientific research (Spier 2002). The goal is for peer reviewers to evaluate a manuscript for quality in study design, replicability, analysis, and clarity of writing and to suggest ways to make improvements for eventual publication. As the editorial assistant for the journals of The Wildlife Society (TWS) since 2006, most of my job entails assigning reviewers for our manuscript submissions. There are numerous challenges in the process, including finding good reviewers, getting timely reviews, and avoiding exploitation of quality reviewers. As such, I wanted to share my perspective on the nuts and bolts of the review process from behind the scenes and to make a few suggestions to potential reviewers. “Review for others as you would have them review for you” (McPeek et al. 2009: E157). The golden rule of reviewing, also called reciprocal altruism (McPeek et al. 2009), is a good rule to live by, and good reviewing is what makes science move forward in a system of checks and balances. If you are an author publishing in TWS journals, other wildlife scientists have reviewed your work. They have taken time out of their lives to help ensure your study is sound, your writing is clear, your methods can be replicated, and the implications for management follow directly from your results. They have volunteered to do a mostly thankless task to further quality science. In a reciprocal altruistic system, authors become reviewers and the cycle continues. In some ways, authors owe it to each other to serve as reviewers. It is not only authors who can review, however. Scientists who do not, or have not, published can review. Early career scientists with little to no publishing experience can review. Students can review, with or without supervision from a mentor. A doctoral degree is not a prerequisite. What is required is a familiarity with relevant literature, a sense of good study design, and an ability to provide constructive criticism in an impartial way. We select reviewers from our user database, recommendations for other potential referees from declining reviewers, or using search engines such as Google Scholar. To volunteer as a reviewer, you can create a profile in the manuscript submission system for the journals in which you have an interest. Authorship is not necessary for this step. Relevant, specific keywords will help editorial assistants and associate editors identify you from the reviewer pool. For example, in the database I use for the Journal of Wildlife Management, if I enter the word deer into the search, I receive an error message that there are more than 500 results. There are thousands of users in our database, many with similar expertise. My recommendation as one who assigns reviewers is to list as many terms as necessary to describe your background. General terms like ecology or conservation are not necessarily helpful. On the other hand, listing scientific names for your study species and narrow research techniques or analyses might make you undiscoverable. Examples of helpful keywords might be passerines, grassland birds, wolves, camera surveys, nest survival, integrated population models, and other broad topics. So you've been invited to review—now what? Balance your decision to accept the review between the impetus to contribute to quality manuscripts with your familiarity with the topic and relevant literature and your ability to carve out the time to think critically about the manuscript. Sometimes a reviewer, once reminded their review is due, writes in to say they are on a month-long vacation and can get to it when they return. In theory, this individual was aware the vacation was coming up and they should have declined the invitation. Of course there are legitimate tasks or projects that will pop up and take priority over reviews. We allow 3 weeks to return comments for the Journal of Wildlife Management and Wildlife Society Bulletin (3 months for Wildlife Monographs). The review duration should allow plenty of time to either complete the review in part of a day, or spread out the task over the 3 weeks, depending on your schedule and the length and complexity of the manuscript. Conflicts of interest can also weigh into your decision to review, perhaps because you work closely with the authors, have already reviewed a version of the manuscript, or have potential frictions with the authors. Consider whether there would be any biases in your assessment of the manuscript and contact the editorial office if you are unsure. If you decide you cannot commit to reviewing, our system will ask for suggestions of other potential reviewers. This step can be extremely useful to the editor or assistant who is trying to secure 2 willing and qualified participants. I have a background in wildlife science, but I am mostly familiar with scientists in my field of study and from the era of my graduate degrees who are now senior scientists or retired. Experts recommending other experts make my job much easier; it also ensures we are selecting someone qualified to review the manuscript and provides a way to expand our reviewer database with early career professionals and graduate students. If you decide to accept the review, punctuality is key. Authors are chomping at the bit to receive the decision. It can take a day or 2 to check that the manuscript is appropriate for the journal and assign an associate editor. It could take anywhere from a couple of days to several weeks to find 2 willing reviewers. Most reviewers take the entire 3 weeks to review, and many miss the deadline. Once reviews have been received, the associate editor has 3 weeks in which to read the manuscript, read the 2 reviews, and to make a recommendation to the Editor-in-Chief (EIC). The EIC then assesses the reviews and recommendation to render a publication decision. You can see how delays in any of those areas, and possibly all of them, will create a cascading effect of a long review duration that is frustrating to authors. Reviewers who fail to return comments can delay the process even further. A good rule of thumb is to communicate with the editorial staff if there will be any delays with reviews so they can decide how best to proceed. This editorial is not meant as a primer in reviewing best practices as there are numerous how-to guides out there and we provide reviewer guidelines with each assignment. My best advice is that a quality review will focus on the science rather than style or grammar. Our staff can assist in the polishing of an article; we have an in-house content editor who will tackle the basics of the writing. And remember: review for others as you would have them review for you. We send a heartfelt thank you to our reviewers, realizing the altruism involved and the time it takes out of your busy schedules. Good science depends on you. I thank A. S. Cox and P. R. Krausman for helpful comments on earlier drafts.",en

It has been widely referenced since it was excavated in the 1920s, due partly to the relatively early excavation and publication of the site, and partly to the qualitative and quantitative importance of its archaeological remains. Unfortunately, as it was an older excavation and lacked present-day rigorous methodological approaches, this important site has been somewhat relegated to the background in the reviews about the Neolithic at the end of the 20th century. However, during the last few years, both the site itself and its archaeological remains have been the object of new studies that hopefully will return the site to the forefront of discussions about the Mediterranean Neolithic. We here present the most relevant results of the research carried out by our group (i.e., pottery study, radiocarbon dating, and isotope analysis), and contextualize them within the dense research history of the cave and the studies carried out by other colleagues with the purpose of revisiting its materials and increasing the knowledge available from the site. Radiocarbon dates on human remains show that the cave was used during prehistoric times as a funerary space longer than expected, and also sporadically afterwards. The characterization of the pottery assemblage concludes that most materials belong to the Early Neolithic. Isotopic analysis portrays an overall similar diet based on terrestrial C3 resources throughout prehistoric times, with a possible varied dietary protein input between individuals during the Early Neolithic.",en

In this contribution, we document some historical aspects of his life and briefly review Emil Grosse’s trajectory from Germany to Brazil. The oldest record of Emil Grosse in Brazil dates from August 20, 1936, when he worked at the “Fábrica mine” until 1939. The Fábrica mine contains an iron deposit located southeast of the São Francisco Craton in what is now known as Quadrilátero Ferrífero, within the municipality of Ouro Preto. Grosse worked in a hematite ore site located in a banded iron formation (BIF), but there is no record of him having worked in the coal deposits. Years after, in 1946, the Fábrica mine changed owners and name to Ferteco, a subsidiary of the German corporation Industriegewerkschaft Bergbau, with headquarters in Bochum, Germany, where Grosse possibly worked to validate the deposit. In the 1940s, Grosse lived between the steelworks town of Peine, Germany, and Belo Horizonte, Brazil. There is a record of his trip in the middle of the Second World War on October 26, 1942. In 1946, his work on the Fábrica mine was finally published in Volume XI (No. 62) of the Brazilian journal Mineração e Metalurgia. Later, on August 18, 1949, Grosse obtained his permanent visa through the mediation of the Brazilian Military Mission and the German control council. Finally, he settled in Würzburg, Germany, where in 1971, he died at the age of 91.",en

https://openalex.org/W4386585463,2023,Geography,"Special ReportFigure: geriatric ED care, delirium, falls, polypharmacy, GED guidelinesEight years after the Geriatric Emergency Department Guidelines were published, the vast majority of U.S. emergency departments still do not provide the level of service they recommend, leaving older patients vulnerable depending on where they receive care. The guidelines were endorsed by the American College of Emergency Physicians, the American Geriatrics Society, the Emergency Nurses Association, and the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (http://bit.ly/3WWYYqg), which should be imprimatur enough for their adoption, but the guidelines, which characterize the complex needs of older ED patients and current best practices, should be considered only “aspirational” at this time, according to an article written after a panel discussion by emergency physicians and geriatricians at the 2021 American Academy of Emergency Medicine Scientific Assembly and published in the Journal of Emergency Medicine and the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society. (J Emerg Med. 2022;62[5]:585.) “The GED Guidelines make specific recommendations regarding evaluation protocols, nurse and physician education, emergency department infrastructure, quality improvement dashboard metrics, optimal staffing, and follow-up care,” said Richard Shih, MD, a professor of emergency medicine at the Florida Atlantic University Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine and Delray Medical Center and a senior author of the article. “The recommendations are extensive, and most emergency departments before the guidelines as well as now have neither the resources nor hospital administrative support to provide this best practice type of care.” The article focuses on delirium, falls, and polypharmacy, three high-impact geriatric clinical conditions frequently seen in the ED. Delirium, which occurs in seven to 20 percent of older ED patients and is an independent predictor of death and accelerated cognitive and functional decline, is not only common but often missed in older patients in the emergency department, the authors said. Approximately one in three community-dwelling adults over 65 suffers falls, and older adults who present to an ED after a fall have an approximately 30 percent greater risk of functional decline and depression at six months after the event. The GED Guidelines for fall prevention reflect best practices, but they are not typically completed in most ED cases. Polypharmacy is also common among older adults and has been associated with adverse drug reactions, but rapidly identifying medication issues is difficult to accomplish in the ED, as is deprescribing. “The guideline recommendations on these and other areas of geriatric emergency care all make sense, but most emergency departments don't come close to operating that way,” Dr. Shih said. Challenges to Implementation Geriatric emergency medicine has not been top of mind for leaders in emergency medicine on the national or local front, said Maura Kennedy, MD, the chief of geriatric emergency medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. She said EDs are in the process of improving care for geriatric ED patients, just not in the time frame they had hoped for when the guidelines came out. “Change takes time, and the reality is also that there have been a lot of competing priorities,” she said. “The COVID-19 pandemic and our boarding crisis have appropriately consumed the attention of a lot of our leadership and taken away some of our local ability to address other issues, including geriatric ED care. With finite resources and time, our leaders have had to make difficult decisions about what to focus on.” Other challenges also prevented wider adoption of the geriatric emergency department guidelines, Dr. Kennedy said, including a tendency to overestimate how well the institution is already doing on these issues. “Among ED leadership and individual clinicians, there remains a lack of knowledge about how good we are or are not at caring for older individuals in the ED,” she said. “In a survey we conducted, we found that the vast majority of respondents said they were advanced or expert in detecting delirium among older ED patients, but other studies clearly show that delirium is commonly missed in the ED. There's a lack of recognition that we have a lot of work to do this area.” The health care staffing shortage is another major barrier, Dr. Kennedy said, noting that EDs need physician and nurse champions to be a geriatric ED. “And nurses are being asked to do more and more—suicide screenings, domestic violence screenings, and other required best practices—with more patients boarding in the ED and fewer nurses,” she said. “Maintaining quality with one more initiative in the setting of a major nursing shortage is difficult.” EDs can pursue Level 1, 2, or 3 accreditation, with Level 1 being the most rigorous, said Dr. Kennedy, a member of the accreditation team for ACEP's Geriatric Emergency Department Accreditation program (GEDA) that was launched in 2018 and is based on the GED guidelines. “Although adoption of best practices may not be where we want it to be, as of today we have over 350 accredited GEDAs,” she said. “It takes a lot of work to get your application through the review process and get it approved, and it costs money with no reimbursement from Medicare or Medicaid, and yet over 350 EDs have received accreditation and we have about 200 in various stages of submission. More importantly, people are coming back and renewing and upgrading. More than 50 sites have renewed their accreditation, and 13 of those have upgraded from Level 3 to 2 or 2 to 1.” Adoption of GED principles has been particularly challenging in rural hospitals. A 2021 study assessing the reach and adoption of GEDA by Dr. Kennedy and colleagues found that only nine of 225 accredited geriatric EDs at the time were in rural regions. (Ann Emerg Med. 2022;79[4]:367; http://bit.ly/3Et19dW.) These hospitals, often extremely resource-constricted, are particularly in need of incentives to pursue GEDA, but they don't always find them, said Christopher Carpenter, MD, a professor of emergency medicine at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, a member of the GEDA advisory board, and an author of the recent commentary. He said he spoke last year with a colleague from a resource-limited rural hospital that had sought accreditation whose experience was eye-opening. “They expected it would be highlighted by their institution and would help improve their market share in the region as the only hospital in the area to have geriatric-friendly care,” Dr. Carpenter said, but none of that happened. “Their certificate was buried in a back hallway, no administrator drew attention to it or congratulated them, and payers didn't seem to care that they were the region's only geriatric ED.” Positive Feedback But other rural geriatric EDs have been recognized and inspired their colleagues. Alice Peck Day Memorial Hospital, part of Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health, is a rural 25-bed critical access hospital serving a large geriatric population that achieved Level 2 GEDA certification in 2021. One area of focus has been transitions of care where their callback program contacts all patients over 70 two to three days after ED discharge, said Jennifer V. Pope, MD, an assistant professor of medicine at Dartmouth's Geisel School of Medicine and the medical director of APD's GEDA program. “When someone is in the ED for an acute issue, they are often distracted, stressed, and in pain, so they may not keep up with the verbal and written instructions given to them by the physician and nurse when they are discharged. Reinforcing these instructions in a follow-up phone call, as well as examining any difficulties they may have understanding or filling prescriptions and barriers they may be finding in getting appointments with specialists or primary care doctors, is very important for our geriatric patients.” After Kristie Foster, RN, an APD ED nurse manager and clinical educator who spearheaded the GEDA program development, spoke at local geriatric meetings about the callback program, other hospitals in the area began following suit and implementing similar initiatives. “Patients are so touched by our callbacks that they ask to convert over to Alice Peck Day for their primary care. In one month, we had 13 referrals to our primary care program. This is what patients are looking for,” Ms. Foster said in a video about the program screened at the 2022 ACEP Scientific Assembly. “One patient stands out in my memory, a woman in her 80s with back pain that was 10 out of 10,” she said. “We sent her home with Tylenol and ibuprofen because there were no acute findings. When we called back, she was almost in tears. She'd tried to get a referral to a pain clinic and was told it would be months. She said, ‘I guess I'm just going to have to live with this.’ We told her that was not acceptable, and called our primary care service here and got her to see them that day and into the pain clinic that week. She was overcome with gratitude and told us she was a retired nurse, and that she would have been honored to work alongside people like us.” The Next Steps State officials are also starting to pay attention to geriatric emergency care with initiatives like the one in Massachusetts, where the governor signed a law in 2018 focusing on care of those with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. One aspect of that law requires hospitals to have an operational plan for caring for those with dementia in acute settings, Dr. Kennedy said. “It's really driving our local hospitals to think about dementia and delirium care in the ED,” she said. “New Hampshire recently passed a similar law.” The GED guidelines as written in 2014 were based more on expert consensus than higher quality evidence from the medical literature, said Phillip Magidson, MD, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the director of observation and geriatric emergency medicine at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. And they are now undergoing an exhaustive review and update process. Dr. Carpenter said this will include a systematic review and meta-analysis for each question in which they walk through the GRADE-based Evidence-to-Decision framework, outlining and citing the scope of the problem and the direct and indirect evidence to support every intervention, diagnostic test, or prognostic test that is recommended. “The review will also quantify the desirable and undesirable effects and cost-effectiveness of the recommended tests or interventions, including health equity considerations,” he said. The effort is entirely unfunded, and the entire clinical team donates its time. Dr. Carpenter said they are starting with systematic reviews for delirium that they hope to publish by the end of the year. After that, they will tackle dementia. “I believe that as the general population gets older, there is an epidemic in geriatric emergency care coming toward us, and we need to start preparing for it,” Dr. Shih said. “More simple emergent conditions are being treated in urgent care centers, and in the ED, we are already seeing more and more complex older patients with a higher acuity rate. I think that trend is going to increase, and we need to start preparing for it now.” Share this article on Twitter and Facebook.

IntroductionLiberica coffee, an often-overlooked species, has emerged from the shadow of Arabica and Canephora in recent years, gaining recognition and value due to various factors. As climate change continues to impact the global production of Arabica and Canephora, coffee professionals have begun exploring alternative species, with Liberica topping their list. Additionally, Liberica coffee has made notable appearances in world coffee competitions, challenging the dominance of prestigious Arabicas. Despite it’s growing fame, limited studies can be found regarding Liberica’s sensory lexicon and flavor profiling based on different growing conditions and post-harvest processing methods. Such information is crucial as sensory quality is mostly responsible for Liberica coffee’s rise in popularity in the past decade. 2. MethodsThe information presented in this paper is mostly qualitative data collected via different means:Descriptions of Liberica’s sensory attributesfound in the existing literature.Liberica sensory evaluation data in the form of flavor descriptions recorded via cupping tests by trained coffee experts in various cupping events (scores are not used because there is a lack of an grading system for Liberica).Liberica sensory evaluation data collected from judges (coffee experts) at the first Liberica Roasting Competition conducted in 2019, which were later compiled into a graphic info chart that will be attached in this paper.Descriptions of Liberica’s sensory attributes recorded from interviews with specialty Liberica coffee producers and coffee scientists who are specialized in coffee sensory.The above data will be analyzed and categorized according to the different origins, processing methods, elevation, and roast levels. The results will then be compiled and transcribed to data relatable to the Cirad Coffee Flavor Wheel used in a paper that studied sensory attributes of vaiours coffee species to assess which range of spectrum of the flavor wheel best represents Liberica’s sensory aspects in light of the different treatments and conditions of this species. 3. Results and DiscussionThe recent emphasis on the different cultivation conditions, varieties, processing methods, and roast levels advocated within the specialty coffee community has led to new sensory discoveries of Liberica coffee. Unsurprisingly, many flavor descriptions from our data could not be located on the existing flavor wheels and sensory lexicon, and there are numerous positive sensory aspects that represent exotic fruits and spices and herbs found only in Asia. This opens up the discussion to why Liberica has been better appreciated in recent years compared to the negative sensory descriptions associated with the species historically, thus more focus should be placed on growing conditions and post-harvest treatment. The results also indicate the need for a new approach and grading system to evaluate this rare and uprising species. And more studies and flavor charting should be conducted for the many undocumented Liberica varieties that we had encountered during sample collection.

https://openalex.org/W4387150657,2023,Geography,"Diet and subsistence in the Alps in Late Antiquity: Organic residue analysis of pottery from an upland site in the Dolomites (Busa delle Vette, Veneto, Italy)The Busa delle Vette site was investigated as part of the UPLanD project, focused on the archaeology of pastoralism, to shed light on the lifeways of pastoral groups during the summer months. The site is composed of a hut and some enclosures located on a glacial cirque at 1850 m asl, in the Dolomites (Veneto, Italy), dating back from the Late Antiquity to the Early Middle Ages (5th to the 11th century CE). Initial data suggested that the hut was used by groups of shepherds for transhumance, but new evidence began to point to a possible different function. Thirty ceramic sherds of cooking pots dated to the Early Middle Ages (6th to 9th century CE), were analysed through organic residues analysis to identify their use and reconstruct the dietary habits of the people living at the site. The results of the analysis were discussed in relation to unpublished archaeozoological and archaeobotanical evidence to shed some light on the activities that were carried out in the investigated hut and the function of the site. The findings suggest that the cooking pots were mainly used to prepare soups and stews. Ruminant adipose products were identified in most of the investigated pots, sometimes associated with ruminant dairy products and millet. These data are consistent with the archaeozoological and archaeobotanical records, suggesting an intense use of this structure, not limited to seasonal pastoral practices but also associated to the mobility of troops and travellers through the local mountain passes. More research is necessary to validate this fascinating hypothesis, as comparable sites have never been identified in the Alps.",en

Severe caloric restriction, often a part of self-directed dieting, is usually accompanied by elimination of whole food groups and deprivation.11Polivy J. Herman C.P. Dieting and binging. A causal analysis.Am Psychol. 1985; 40: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar Conversely, given that a primary goal of IBIs is to sustain changes in weight and healthy habits, dietary intake goals are designed to optimize flexibility and livability and to prevent deprivation. These treatments focus on improving overall diet quality by increasing intake of nutrient-dense foods and moderating intake of high-energy-dense foods;10Wilfley D.E. Hayes J.F. Balantekin K.N.

As such, research has shown that IBIs are associated with a reduction in cravings and hunger, underscoring that obesity treatment does not necessarily require deprivation.12Chao A.M. Wadden T.A.

For instance, treatments for substance use show relapse rates of 40% to 60% and, at 9 years, 40% to 60% of individuals who attend eating disorder treatment are not recovered.26Mclellan A.T.

On the contrary, it would be considered unethical to not provide such a treatment just because some individuals experience relapse. Weight loss alone does not describe the full picture. Sustained changes in health-related behaviors such as increasing activity, improving diet quality or sleep, improving stress management skills, and/or improvements in health-related markers should also be considered when thinking about the effectiveness of an IBI. Weight cycling is also not an inevitable outcome of weight regain. The Look AHEAD study, as described earlier, demonstrated that the majority of participants did not experience any weight cycling over 8 years following participation in an IBI; rather, rates of weight cycling in the intervention group were actually lower than those in the control group.28Pacanowski C.R.

An objective of our original article was to illustrate the differences between the destructive and pervasive messaging promoted by diet culture and the science behind IBIs, which differ significantly from self-directed dieting in terms of harms and its relationship with weight stigma and internalized weight bias. In addition, we acknowledge that weight is only one of many data points in assessing health risk and that simply looking at a person’s weight or body mass index does not convey information about a patient’s health, behaviors, or habits. Other physiological, psychological, and behavioral parameters are also important in consideration of overall health and well-being, such as use of the Edmonton Classification Systems, which assess physical, mental, and functional health in the characterization of weight severity.38Atlantis E.

However, weight-inclusive interventions currently have no long-term data and have not been tested among marginalized or minoritized racial and ethnic groups, those with severe obesity, or those with comorbidities. Future research is warranted, and funding is needed, to evaluate hard outcomes of weight-inclusive approaches. The commentators state that focusing on weight loss as treatment increases the risk of weight stigma and eating disorder development. However, the few studies that have included measures of weight stigma in IBIs have shown modest decreases (not increases) in perceived and internalized weight stigma.44Pearl R.L. Wadden T.A.

Still, these findings suggest that, for patients, weight loss and stigma reduction are not necessarily contradictory efforts and can indeed be complementary, especially when treatment is delivered in a compassionate and respectful manner. With a more balanced focus on the use of weight as only one (of many possible) indicators of overall health and a call to stop the perpetuation and proliferation of weight stigma, we believe it is possible to reverse the internalized bias and shame that can result from struggles in managing one’s weight. However, continued research is needed in the weight management field on the topic of weight stigma and eating pathology. Ultimately, we believe providers should have collaborative relationships with their patients, providing patient-centered care that meets the desired goals of the patient and promotes overall health and well-being. This means encouraging patients to challenge the goal of a thin ideal and move toward a healthy ideal, getting away from a one-size-fits-all approach regarding treatment, and pursuing behaviors to achieve patient goals. However, systematic reviews show that for most adolescents and adults, IBIs do not worsen eating disorder risk, at least during the intervention and early follow-up period, and result in modest improvements.49Jebeile H.

https://openalex.org/W4319790669,2023,Geography,"Another big year in the water worldWelcome to this New Year 2023, and to more inspirational actions toward better water governance around the world. After the last three years of pandemic, the emergence of more awareness of interconnected problems of human health, the environment, and water resources availability highlighted the need for better and more applied research and more effective practices of water governance with a long-term perspective. The new threats that lay ahead of us are very obviously demonstrating the demand for more information on behavior of resistant microorganisms, more efficient sanitation systems, and broader WASH strategies to face the “One Health” challenges. World Water Policy Journal will launch four issues per year from 2023 on, with two of them being Special Issues dedicated to debate of water problems with a regional focus. The first Special Issue in 2023 will bring studies and research outcomes from South Asia, and the second will focus on Africa. Opening that path, this issue covers several cases in Asia and Africa, paving the way to the two Special Issues that we will launch this year. In the first contribution to this issue, we welcome a Guest Editorial from Vishal Singh, Executive Director and Director of Research, Centre for Ecology Development and Research (CEDAR), Dehradun, India. Vishal makes an impassioned and timely plea to all that we do not ignore the water crisis. Focusing on the situation in the Himalayas, he highlights the risks to humanity of failing to act effectively and discusses the critical actions needed. In the first research article, Md Nurul Momen and Md Mostafijur Rahman discuss The Impoverishment of Political Discourse and Legal Rights in Transboundary Teesta Water Management. Exploring the barriers to transboundary water management between the two riparian countries, Bangladesh, and India, as well as the reasons for water negotiations remaining unsettled, the authors propose a cooperative strategy for sustainable Teesta River water sharing. Despite access to safe drinking water long having been recognized as a basic human right, widespread disparities exist, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. In the next article, Edith Malemba and Wanyama Masinde use the case study of the Lilongwe Water Board, Malawi, to discuss the Impact of The Policy Framework and Institutional Set Up on Urban Water Supply. Through a case study lens, the authors examine the policy and institutional frameworks involved, discuss the current limitations, and make recommendations for future directions. The Political Ecology of Small Freshwater Bodies in Kerala, India, is the subject of the next article by Vinay Sankar and Lavanya Suresh. Examining empirical studies and theoretical debates to understand the process of institutionalization, the authors argue that a “politics of empty space” operating in policy and practice has resulted in a partial decommodification of rural waters in Kerala, allowing oppressed and marginalized communities to co-produce ecological assets, demonstrating a new starting point to address broader water and environmental crises. In their article Impact of Transport and Storage Practices on The Microbiological Quality of Drinking Water in Godomey District (Abomey-Calavi Municipality) in Benin Republic, Sévérin Ikpe, Yéwêgnon Alima Esther Irma Nougbode, Hervé Labite, and Daouda Mama make an important contribution to understanding the risk and causes of drinking water contamination at the household level, highlighting the importance of both supply and in-home care. Reshma Sinha, Yojana Thakur, and Aseem Grover then pose and answer the question Does physicochemical parameters of water affect macroinvertebrates population? Noting that balanced ecosystems require the mutual existence of flora, fauna, and other abiotic factors, the authors reviewed the composition, structure, and functioning of aquatic macroinvertebrates communities, along with the relationships with the physiochemical factors of water, observing that certain species possess pollution, temperature, and water velocity tolerance capabilities. In the final article in this issue, Never Mujere, Brian Murove, and Webster Gumindoga present the case of Manyame River catchment, Zimbabwe, to discuss spatiotemporal variation of rainfall and its implications on water resources management. Analyzing the spatiotemporal variation of rainfall in the period 1982–2017, the authors note monthly, quarterly, and seasonal trends across the catchment, demonstrating the utility of rainfall estimates in understanding temporal and spatial variations in rainfall at a catchment scale. We hope that these articles, and readings, may contribute to your wisdom and enlightenment in your efforts towards your better water policy and practice, wherever you are. Wishing you all a safer and healthier 2023. Susana Neto | Jeff Camkin Editors-in-Chief World Water Policy Journal 水世界的又一个重要的一年 欢迎来到 2023 年, 同时欢迎更多鼓舞人心的行动来改善世界各地的水治理。 继三年的大流行之后, 人们对人类健康、环境和水资源可用量等相互关联的问题有了更多的认识, 这强调了从长远角度在水治理方面进行“更好、更多的应用研究和更有效的实践”的必要性。摆在我们面前的新威胁非常明显地表明, 需要更多关于耐药微生物行为的信息、更高效的卫生系统和更广泛的 “水、环境卫生和个人卫生”(WASH) 战略, 以应对“同一个健康”的挑战。 《世界水政策杂志》从2023年开始将每年发行四期, 其中两期是特刊, 专门讨论以区域为重点的水问题。2023 年的第一期特刊将带来来自南亚的研究成果, 第二期特刊将聚焦非洲。本期涵盖了亚洲和非洲的多个案例, 为我们今年将推出的两期特刊奠定基础。 本期收录的第一篇文章中, 我们欢迎由印度德拉敦生态发展与研究中心 (CEDAR) 的执行主任兼研究主任Vishal Singh撰写的客座社论。Vishal热烈且及时地呼吁我们不要忽视水危机。聚焦于喜马拉雅山的形势, 他强调了“未能有效行动”给人类带来的风险, 并探讨了需要采取的关键行动。 在第一篇研究文章中, Md Nurul Momen和Md Mostafijur Rahman探讨了《提斯塔河跨边界水资源管理中政治话语和法律权利的匮乏》。作者探究了孟加拉国和印度这两个河岸国家之间的跨边界水资源管理障碍, 以及仍然尚未解决的水资源谈判的原因, 提出了一项用于提斯塔河可持续水资源共享的合作战略。 尽管安全饮用水获取长期以来一直被视为一项基本人权, 但仍然存在广泛的不平等, 尤其是在撒哈拉以南非洲地区。本期收录的第二篇文章中, Edith Malemba和Wanyama Masinde使用马拉维利隆圭水务局的案例研究来探讨《政策框架和制度设置对城市供水的影响》。透过案例研究视角, 作者分析了所涉及的政策和制度框架, 探讨了当前的局限性, 并为未来方向提出了建议。 下一篇文章《印度喀拉拉邦小型淡水水体的政治生态学》由Vinay Sankar和Lavanya Suresh撰写。通过检验实证研究和理论辩论以理解制度化的过程, 作者论证认为, 在政策和实践中运作的“空白空间政治”(politics of empty space)已导致喀拉拉邦农村水资源的部分去商品化, 使得受压迫和被边缘化的社区能够合作生产生态资产, 证明了应对更广泛的水危机和环境危机的新起点。 Sévérin Ikpe、Yéwêgnon Alima Esther Irma Nougbode、Hervé Labite和Daouda Mama在他们的文章《贝宁共和国阿波美卡拉维市戈多梅区域的饮用水运输和储存方法对饮用水微生物质量的影响》中作出了重要贡献, 以理解家庭饮用水污染的风险和起因, 强调水供应和家庭护理的重要性。 Reshma Sinha、Yojana Thakur和Aseem Grover撰写的文章提出并回答了一个问题, 即水的物理化学参数是否会影响大型无脊椎动物种群?通过指出平衡的生态系统需要植物群、动物群和其他非生物因素的共同存在, 作者审视了水生大型无脊椎动物群落的组成、结构和功能, 以及与水的理化因素的关系, 并发现某些物种在污染、温度和水流速度方面具有耐受能力。 本期收录的最后一篇文章中, Never Mujere、Brian Murove和Webster Gumindoga介绍了津巴布韦Manyame河流域的案例, 探讨《降雨量的时空差异及其对水资源管理的影响》。通过分析1982年至2017年间降雨量的时空差异, 作者记录了流域的每月趋势、季度趋势和季节趋势, 证明了降雨量估计在“理解流域层面的降雨量时空差异”方面的用处。 我们希望, 无论您身在何处, 这些文章和读物都能为您在努力制定更好的水政策和实践方面提供智慧和启发。 祝大家2023年平安健康。 Susana Neto | Jeff Camkin 主编 《世界水政策杂志》 Otro gran año en el mundo del agua Le damos la bienvenida a este Año Nuevo 2023 y a más acciones inspiradoras hacia una mejor gobernanza del agua en todo el mundo. Después de los últimos tres años de pandemia, el surgimiento de una mayor conciencia de los problemas interconectados de la salud humana, el medio ambiente y la disponibilidad de recursos hídricos destacó la necesidad de una investigación mejor y más aplicada, y prácticas más efectivas de gobernanza del agua con una perspectiva a largo plazo. Las nuevas amenazas que nos esperan están demostrando muy obviamente la demanda de más información sobre el comportamiento de los microorganismos resistentes, sistemas de saneamiento más eficientes y estrategias WASH más amplias para enfrentar los desafíos de “One Health.” World Water Policy Journal lanzará cuatro números por año a partir de 2023, dos de los cuales serán números especiales dedicados al debate de los problemas del agua con un enfoque regional. El primer número especial de 2023 traerá estudios y resultados de investigación del sur de Asia, y el segundo se centrará en África. Abriendo ese camino, este número cubre varios casos en Asia y África, allanando el camino para los dos números especiales que lanzaremos este año. En la primera contribución a este número, damos la bienvenida a un editorial invitado de Vishal Singh, director ejecutivo y director de investigación del Centro para el Desarrollo y la Investigación en Ecología (CEDAR), Dehradun, India. Vishal hace un llamado apasionado y oportuno a todos para que no ignoremos la crisis del agua. Centrándose en la situación en el Himalaya, destaca los riesgos para la humanidad de no actuar de manera efectiva y analiza las acciones críticas necesarias. En el primer artículo de investigación, Md Nurul Momen y Md Mostafijur Rahman analizan el empobrecimiento del discurso político y los derechos legales en la gestión del agua transfronteriza de Teesta. Explorando las barreras para la gestión del agua transfronteriza entre los dos países ribereños, Bangladesh y la India, así como las razones por las que las negociaciones sobre el agua siguen sin resolverse, los autores proponen una estrategia cooperativa para compartir el agua del río Teesta de forma sostenible. A pesar de que el acceso al agua potable se ha reconocido desde hace mucho tiempo como un derecho humano básico, existen disparidades generalizadas, particularmente en el África subsahariana. En el siguiente artículo, Edith Malemba y Wanyama Masinde utilizan el estudio de caso de la Junta de Agua de Lilongwe, Malawi, para analizar el impacto del marco de políticas y la configuración institucional en el suministro de agua urbano. A través de la lente de un estudio de caso, los autores examinan los marcos políticos e institucionales involucrados, discuten las limitaciones actuales y hacen recomendaciones para direcciones futuras. La ecología política de los pequeños cuerpos de agua dulce en Kerala, India, es el tema del próximo artículo de Vinay Sankar y Lavanya Suresh. Al examinar estudios empíricos y debates teóricos para comprender el proceso de institucionalización, los autores argumentan que una “política del espacio vacío” que opera en la política y la práctica ha resultado en una desmercantilización parcial de las aguas rurales en Kerala, lo que permite a las comunidades oprimidas y marginadas coproducir activos ecológicos, lo que demuestra un nuevo punto de partida para abordar crisis hídricas y ambientales más amplias. En su artículo Impacto de las prácticas de transporte y almacenamiento en la calidad microbiológica del agua potable en el distrito de Godomey (municipio de Abomey-Calavi) en la República de Benín, Sévérin Ikpe, Yéwêgnon Alima Esther Irma Nougbode, Hervé Labite y Daouda Mama hacen una importante contribución a la comprensión de la riesgo y causas de la contaminación del agua potable a nivel domiciliario, destacando la importancia tanto del abastecimiento como del cuidado en el hogar. Reshma Sinha, Yojana Thakur y Aseem Grover luego plantean y responden la pregunta: ¿Los parámetros fisicoquímicos del agua afectan la población de macroinvertebrados? Al señalar que los ecosistemas equilibrados requieren de la existencia mutua de flora, fauna y otros factores abióticos, los autores revisaron la composición, estructura y funcionamiento de las comunidades de macroinvertebrados acuáticos, así como las relaciones con los factores fisicoquímicos del agua, observando que ciertas especies poseen contaminación, temperatura y capacidades de tolerancia a la velocidad del agua. En el artículo final de este número, Never Mujere, Brian Murove y Webster Gumindoga presentan el caso de la cuenca del río Manyame, Zimbabue, para analizar la variación espaciotemporal de las precipitaciones y sus implicaciones en la gestión de los recursos hídricos. Al analizar la variación espaciotemporal de las precipitaciones en el período 1982–2017, los autores observan las tendencias mensuales, trimestrales y estacionales en toda la cuenca, lo que demuestra la utilidad de las estimaciones de precipitaciones para comprender las variaciones temporales y espaciales de las precipitaciones a escala de cuenca. Esperamos que estos artículos y lecturas puedan contribuir a su sabiduría e iluminación en sus esfuerzos por mejorar su política y práctica del agua, dondequiera que se encuentre. Les deseamos un 2023 más seguro y saludable. Susana Neto | Jeff Camkin Editores en Jefe World Water Policy Journal",en

Multidisciplinary and functional approach to modular kilnsThis paper deals with the so-called modular kilns, ceramic structures characteristic of the Bronze and Iron Age periods in various regions of Europe. Despite the interest shown in these material forms in recent years, their exact function is still unclear. However, the dominant interpretation within archaeological research has tended to associate them with pottery production. While this hypothesis has been based mainly on macro-observations derived from settlement surveys and excavations, our aim is to go further by exploring through a material-analytical approach. A set of samples from the sites of A Fontela and Castromao, in northwestern Iberia, have been analysed using a set of methods (mineralogical, geochemical, archaeobotanical and organic chemical) to evaluate the hypotheses on production and use. Although the samples share a similar morphology and technology, the analytical results reveal differences in the manufacturing processes between the two sites studied. Local clays, crop by-products and wild plants from the surrounding areas were used in the modelling, but with different purposes. In some cases, cereal chaff was added as a temper. Organic-chemical analysis revealed traces of oils of vegetal origin, with high levels of C18:1 fatty acid (probably mostly oleic acid) and its degradation products, together with phytosterols, such as β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, campesterol, and δ-5-avenasterol. The organic compounds are compatible with the processing or culinary transformation of acorns, that appeared persistently in hearths, pots, and storage structures during Late Prehistory in the region.",en

https://openalex.org/W4379745054,2023,Geography,"The View from Pȏle NordSimone Beauvoir's novel She Came to Stay immerses readers in a 1930s Parisian social scene, thanks in part to the character Françoise. Eavesdropping with Françoise on a man and woman seated at a table in the Pȏle Nord café, readers of the novel hear the woman confide, “I've never been able to follow the rules of flirting. I have a morbid horror of being touched.”1 As Françoise invites us to turn our gaze toward another couple seated nearby, we observe a possible instance of the very discomfort to which the first woman has attested. A hapless female looks “uncertainly at a man's huge (grosse) hand that has just pounced on hers (s'abattre sur).”2 Of these two scenes from She Came to Stay, Jean-Paul Sartre memorializes only the second.3 As described by Sartre in Being and Nothingness, a man and a woman on their first date are seated at a table. The man “takes” (prend) the hand of a woman and holds it between “his warm hands” (les mains chaudes) while the woman makes her hand inert, even as she “permits herself to enjoy his desire.”4 Thanks to the pervasive influence of Being and Nothingness on the philosophical canon, the disquieting scene Françoise describes in She Came to Stay largely has been forgotten. Sartre sets the terms for the unfortunate woman's ongoing life: She is a paradigm of “bad faith.” Two decades later, her immortality is secured by René Girard: The woman is a prime exemplar of coquetry, a “fundamental” concept in the development of Girard's theory of mimetic desire.5In the wake of today's #metoo headlines, we may find ourselves eager to weigh in anew on the scene at Pȏle Nord. Are we witnesses to flirtation? Seduction? Unwanted sexual attention? Debates about coercion and guile, predators and prey, are unlikely to be productive; after all, Girard has advised that participants in such debates flounder in a problematic victimology.6 Nevertheless, Sartre and Girard's fascination with the mise en scène at Pȏle Nord warrants reexamination on other grounds. Sartre's discussion of the young woman beset by bad faith in Being and Nothingness is one of several instances in which Sartre is shown exerting a significant influence on Girard. Focusing closely on these occurrences, we can identify features of Sartrian existentialism that contribute constructively to the development of Girard's thought. So also can we uncover a problematic view of the body in mimetic theory. Girard shares with Sartre a profound ambivalence toward embodiment. An alternative perspective visible in Beauvoir's writing could enhance the treatment of the body and eroticism in mimetic theory.Girard's early work attests to Sartre's influence. Writing in Evolution of Desire, Cynthia Haven introduces the topic of Sartre's impact on Girard by recounting Parisian intellectuals’ responses to tensions between Camus and Sartre: “Everyone took one side or the other.” Girard's friends reported that Girard “was on the Sartre side.”7 In an interview with Rebecca Adams, Girard states that “I was influenced by Sartre and Camus, like other people of my generation, especially by Sartre.”8 Girard acknowledges Sartre's influence in several other contexts. In a 2007 interview with Pierpaolo Antonello, Girard recalls his early philosophical interests: “. . . From Sartre I went to Merleau-Ponty and all the authors related to phenomenology, which fascinated me and for a while I wanted to write in the phenomenological style.”9 Commenting in the 2008 preface to La Conversion de l'art, Girard states that he is struck by the Sartrian “tone” of his own writing.10 Scholarly explorations of the specifics of the influence of Sartre on Girard have cataloged the most important Sartrian concepts: a lack of being, the in-itself/for-itself (en-soi/pour-soi); the “projet”; patterns of desire (e.g., masochism and sadism), and bad faith.11 These themes are discussed in what follows, with special attention to Girard and Sartre's perspectives on human sexuality and embodiment.For Girard, humans are beset by a metaphysical disease or ontological illness brought on by mimetic desire.12 Only on a superficial level is mimetic desire oriented toward having things that another has or seeks to acquire. On a deeper level, Girard understands that desire arises in the subject because it lacks being. Looking to another to inform it of what it should desire in order to be, the subject finds its attention drawn not toward the object that the other recommends but toward the other who must surely be capable of conferring an even greater plentitude of being.13 One's desire for the other is ontological: “Imitative desire is always a desire to be Another.”14 Desiring what the other desires because of a prior and more basic desire to be the other, the subject discovers that the closer he or she comes to acquiring the object of the model's desire and, through that acquisition, to the model, the greater the rejection or refusal of the subject by the model.15Sartre's philosophy shares key features with Girard's theory. Central to Sartre's thought is a “lack of being” (manque d’être).16 Sartre arrives at this concept as he distinguishes between the for-itself of human consciousness and the in-itself, all that is not human consciousness. 17 The for-itself always presupposes the in-itself: Consciousness is always consciousness of something.18 In this way, Sartre takes as a starting point a for-itself in a “situation.”19 No mind/body dualism besets the for-itself: It “arises in enterprises and knows itself first in so far as it is reflected in those enterprises.”20 Humans introduce non-being through consciousness, which Sartre defines in terms of activity. As a consequence, the work of the for-itself is negation. The for-itself acts on being: dividing, desiring, choosing, limiting, and organizing a world. Because consciousness is not or, more accurately, is making-not, the for-itself stands out of the density of being in which it otherwise would be engulfed.21 The for-itself as a lack of being exists as radical freedom: “I am in the mode of not being what I am and of being what I am not.”22The lack of being that haunts consciousness, as described by Sartre, is similar to the lack of being that shadows the subject of mimetic desire described by Girard. Sartre writes, “The being of consciousness qua consciousness is to exist at a distance from itself as a presence to itself.”23 According to Girard, because the subject seeks in another the plenitude of being that eludes it, the subject's subjectivity is anchored by an other. Described as a model by Girard, this other may secure the identity of the subject through external mediation. At some remove from the subject by virtue of age or status (e.g., a parent or famous person), the external mediator is a role model. Alternatively, the model may anchor the subject's identity through internal mediation, a form of relationship that creates instability in the subject/other relationship, due to the model's physical and psychological proximity to the subject. 24 Internal mediation precludes mind/body dualism in Girard's theory as well. For both Girard and Sartre, the subject/for-itself always already exists in social relationships because it “does not coincide with itself.”25 Sartre focuses on the relationship of one for-itself to another. Girard addresses the subject's most significant other: the model whose desire the subject wants to imitate.Because Sartre recognizes that embodiment is definitive to human being in our relations with others, in seeking to understand the relation between the for-itself and its other, Sartre turns to the fundamentals of embodied existence. He contends that humans are not situated in relation to each other in regard to place (as books are on or not on my shelf) but in reference to space. Absence and presence establish an embodied presence of others for the for-itself.26 Sartre describes this space as “hodological”: Each for-itself temporalizes its not-being in the presence of others.27 Because the for-itself exists as and in acts of negation—its being is to not be its being—the for-itself also says, “I am the one who is not the other.”28 That act of negation does not give being to the other (as it does to every in-itself); rather, negation gives to the other its being other. Indeed, in an act of double negation, “I make myself to not-be a being that is making himself not-be me.”29 Even so, because the other cannot be revealed in the same upsurge with my negation, the other is a limit. Assuming that limit, I put the other out of play; refusing to join in (mitmachen), the other also puts me out of play.30 As a consequence, discomfort rests at the core of acts of negation by the for-itself.Sartre observes tensions in the relation between a subject and its other. Shame is foremost among Sartre's examples of distress experienced by the for-itself when mutual recognition fails and the for-itself or its other is put out of play. Borrowing another scene from She Came to Stay,31 Sartre takes us to a hotel corridor. A man is spying on an amorous couple through a keyhole in a door.32 Looking around, the spying man realizes he is being watched by someone at the end of the hall. He is ashamed. A moment before, he had existed as a for-itself: someone who is what he is not and is not what he is.33 He had transcended being in the very temporality of his spying project. Now, under the gaze of the other, freedom escapes him. He is the object of a look. He is a peeper. Shame is unique to a for-itself and an other. If the man realizes that no one stands at the end of the hall—he has mistaken a shadow for an observer—he can correct his impression; however, he cannot erase shame. Shame is invoked and revoked only by an other. The look of that other has alienated the man kneeling before the keyhole of the hotel door. In the midst of negation, he has suddenly become a being—a peeper.34 The world has hemorrhaged and the other's freedom—their look—has written being into his body.35 He is ashamed, and that shame is marked by his flushed face, sweaty palms, downcast eyes, and slumped posture.Each appellation that accrues to the for-itself in its relations with others—shame, jealousy, pride—does not belong to it. The notion of “the content of my character” is foreign to Sartre. The for-itself cannot be “ashamed” or “jealous.” Instead, the affective marks of the for-itself's relations with others are conferred on it by the other. The other makes the for-itself an object at the limit of the “I am what I am and am not what I am.”36 In the case of fear, for example, the for-itself becomes an object when the other's acts surpass and transcend its own. Refusing these acts, they are dead possibilities. One who is a for-itself escapes fear only by taking up new projects. So also do attributes such as strength, beauty, and intelligence accrue to a for-itself only when they are conferred on the for-itself by the other. In the absence of new projects, the for-itself, submerged in being by others’ ascriptions, is in-itself.37Girard concurs with Sartre that each of us exists only as a relation to others. Girard's concept of “interdividual psychology” aligns with Sartre's: The human subject is constituted by and through relationships to others. There are no individual-to-individual or interindividual relationships.38 Moreover, Girard also views human life as dynamic but fraught. In the grip of our desires, our relationships become dysfunctional. Where Sartre treats shame as a feature of problematic interactions of the for-itself and its other, Girard emphasizes that affective states such as shame are by-products of a triangulated rivalry among a subject, its model, and a desired object. As rivalries are augmented, a shocking denouement may see all difference between the subject and its model obliterated by a single, common desire; consequently, the model becomes a monstrous double by whom the subject is as much repulsed as she was earlier attracted.39 A myriad of affective states can feature in the monstrous mirroring that becomes ever more conflict-filled. The ontological illness of desire precipitates a mimetic crisis that resolves in sacrifice.40Girard thematizes affective states such as shame as he explores a paradigmatic expression of mimetic desire: masochism. Girard offers a story that summarizes well the dynamics of masochism: A man sets out to discover a treasure he believes is hiding under a stone; he turns over stone after stone but finds nothing. He grows tired of such a futile undertaking but the treasure is too precious for him to give up. So he begins to look for a stone which is too heavy to lift—he places all his hopes in that stone and he will waste all his remaining strength on it.41Girard understands that continual disappointment makes the man in search of treasure “desire his own failure.” He sees that “only that failure will indicate an authentic deity.”42 As a form of metaphysical disease, masochism gathers into one whole previously distinct phases of desire. That the model might harbor hostile intentions against the imitator is entertained, as a matter of course, by the imitator. After all, the imitator feels inferior to the one whose desire he/she is copying. Therefore, when the imitator perceives that access to the source of fulfilled desire is being denied, the imitator will focus blame on the model, who, after all, is superior and must therefore exert more control over desire and its aims than does the imitator.43 However, in masochism, the phases of desire are experienced in compact form: The imitator chooses the model because of the obstruction that the model provides, not because of positive qualities. Acute sensitivity to the model leads the imitator to focus on what he/she perceives to be a necessary relation between unhappiness and shame in the work of desire. A masochist is born when, confronted with a model whose actions are increasingly characterized by poor treatment and hostility, the imitator claims that experience as revelatory of being. Rather than disavow the entire project of metaphysical desire, the masochist sees failure, pain, and suffering as “signs of divinity and the preliminary condition of all metaphysical success.”44 From this moment, whenever the imitator enters the field of desire, he or she will consistently look only for those stones that are too heavy to lift and will see in them the fulfillment of his or her desire.Girard observes the lucidity of the masochist. Because he or she sees connections along the pathway of metaphysical desire that others miss, the masochist is a perceptive consumer of desire. But the masochist does not take full purchase on lucidity. Rather than abandon metaphysical desire, the masochist embraces it all the more.45 Girard writes of this harmful stage in the history of metaphysical desire: “When the desiring subject perceives the abyss that desire has hollowed out beneath his feet, he voluntarily hurls himself into it, hoping against hope to discover in it what the less acute stages of metaphysical sickness have not brought him.”46Sartre and Girard agree on the interdividual features of masochism. We misunderstand masochism if we focus on masochists’ supposed desire for shame, humiliation, and suffering. Humans do not seek out shame and suffering. To the contrary, Girard and Sartre concur that these feelings are by-products of interdividual relationships: Humans seek in others the fullness of being that eludes us. To access this divine being, we will do whatever we perceive to be necessary.47 The difference between Girard and Sartre lies elsewhere. Sartre frames the desire for being (to be refused by the for-itself or capitulated to in bad faith) in terms of embodied acts of reciprocal negation in hodological space: “I make myself not-be a being who is making himself not-be me.”48 Girard understands a similar ontological desire mimetically: We desire according to the desire of the other.49 The object of the other's desire and not only the other play a primary role in desire. Sartre emphasizes double negation as definitive of the relationship of a for-itself with an other.50 Girard focuses on double mediation: a layered triangulation of desire according to the other and its model. As metaphysical disease spreads like a contagion,51 triangular desire doubles as each subject becomes a model for its own model: “We now have a subject-mediator and a mediator-subject, a model-disciple and disciple-model.”52Being, the other, masochism, and sadism are themes in Girard and Sartre's discussions of amorous relationships. Similarities and differences in their perspectives come to the fore in an analysis of their comments on coitus. Sartre writes that at the moment when a lover grasps his beloved in the consummation of their erotic encounter, he finds himself alone. The embodied union of two for-itselves in their respective freedoms does not transpire. Instead, “Everything happens as if I wished to get hold of a man who runs away and leaves only his coat in my hands. It is the coat, it is the outer shell which I possess. I shall never get hold of more than a body.”53 The for-itself becomes an in-itself. Girard's views the culminating moment of erotic passion similarly: “The desiring subject, when he takes possession of the object, finds that he is grasping a void.”54Although Sartre and Girard's comments are similar, they are situated differently within each thinker's discussion. Girard's statement is a coda to his discourse on sexual desire, confirming the trajectory of his thought: Erotic passion is a feature of deviated transcendence and symptomatic of metaphysical disease. Sartre's comment, by contrast, delineates that moment when the promise of sexual fulfillment in love is betrayed unexpectedly in the final moments of sexual union. Thus, Girard's reference to a void confirms the tenor of all his reflections on erotic desire and embodiment. Sartre's allusion to absence, departing from prior, almost lyrical, musings on love and sex, posits ambivalence at the heart of Sartre's theory of human sexuality.Before Sartre succumbs to ambivalence, his portrait of love and sex affirms their existential integrity. Sartre understands that a body does not “belong” to the for-itself nor should features of the body be considered tools for use.55 The body is not an instrument but a manifestation of the surpassing of the for-itself. As a consequence, in expressing love and sexual desire, one does not attend to one's “own” body but to the other's body, in all the complexity of lived existence. From this founding notion of intercorporeality, Sartre assumes that love between the for-itself and its other is expressed through physical intimacy. Because the for-itself exists its body, love is a project in which the for-itself wants to maintain its freedom and at the same time the other's freedom. Moreover, erotic intimacy is an expression of these projects: A lover wants to encounter his beloved's freedom as freedom as they each exist their bodies.56 Sartre refers to this revelation of freedom as “grace.”57Exploring sexual intercourse as a project of freedom, Sartre acknowledges obstacles. Too often the beloved becomes a fascinating object, an in-itself: Physical appearance, material possessions, even a personality become testaments to the beloved's being that leave the erotic project in tatters. Masochism is a paradigmatic outcome of such a failed project: The masochist wants freely to become being in-itself. However, because a for-itself is not-being, not-an-object, the masochist cannot realize its project of being an object for the other in their sexual relationship.58 So also does sadism attest to failure. The sadist attempts the project of capturing the freedom of the other as freedom in the instrumentalizing of the other's flesh.59 The sadist imagines that he can apprehend the Other in the very moment when he and the other are simultaneously birthing the flesh of the for-itself. That is why pain features in sadism: Pain signals the birth of the flesh and promises simultaneously to mark the birth of a for-itself existing its body. But this project destroys “grace” because domination is incompatible with the expression of embodied freedom: One cannot support the other's freedom with tortured flesh.60Articulating the project of erotic desire, Sartre accounts for how the lover's act of negation in the project of love does not give being to the other (making it an in-itself) but gives to the other its being other such that the beloved can in all freedom be a for-itself who is making herself not be her lover's for-itself. For Sartre, the caress aims at that goal: to make the other feel her body as flesh for herself and for the one who caresses her.61 Sartre observes further that the lover's desire is for a particular woman. Neither the uncovered breast of the beloved nor the lover's own ejaculation portrays erotic desire adequately. Rather, in a lover's relationship with his beloved, he wants to apprehend the beloved's situation in the world, the way she exists her body in a particular way in the course of her projects. In this way, the lover and the beloved wish to incarnate their respective consciousnesses with their bodies and exist their bodies as projects of freedom.62Only at the end of his commentary on erotic desire and intimacy does Sartre diverge from this line of thought. As he writes of the consummation of the erotic project in the final moments of sexual intercourse, he states that there is a forgetting of the other. Simultaneous with that forgetting, the body of the beloved becomes an object—one reaches out for the other and grasps only a coat.63 With sex as with all other projects, Sartre doubts that the other can be revealed in the upsurge of negation of a for-itself. Because the other always is a limit, ambivalence shadows Sartre's philosophy of erotic intimacy.64Girard also applies his theory of mimetic desire to the dynamics of erotic yearning. Erotic desire is also desire according to the desire of the other. An erotic triad features a subject, its model, and an object of the model's sexual desire. Girard writes, “The subject's desire is aimed at the body of the mediator [model].”65 Thus, for Girard, the “third” in the triad of sexual desire is not a potential lover toward whom the subject and his model direct their desire; rather, that third is the model's body. As a consequence, the model wields absolute power over the admiring subject's access to the object of desire: “He can grant or refuse possession according to his whim.”66 In distinction from paradigmatic patterns of mimesis previously formulated by Girard, in which the model desires an object prior to the subject's adoption of the model's desire, generating the conditions for mimetic desire, Girard admits that the model may be “incapable of desiring spontaneously” its own object/body. Nevertheless, when the subject reveals his desire to possess the body of the model, the model will copy that desire from the subject: “He will desire his own body; in other words, he will accord it such value that to yield possession would appear scandalous to him.”67Erotic desire is shown to be an instance of double mediation that can account for the triangulation of desire in the absence of a rival: “The beloved is divided into both subject and object in the lover's eyes.”68 In sway to double mediation, the triangle of lover, beloved, and body of the beloved makes every expression of erotic desire an imitation of another's desire. Under the spell of metaphysical disease, sexual desire that would seek fulfillment in the being of the other misfires just as mimetic desire in all other manifestations also misfires. Joining Sartre in his “empty coat” theory of erotic relations, Girard concludes that double mediation in sexual relationships precludes “any reciprocity between the Self and the Other.”69Girard's primary illustration of erotic desire under conditions of deviated transcendence comes from Sartre. When a man sitting across from the woman at Pȏle Nord takes her hand in a “first approach,” she leaves her hand in his grasp “but she does not notice that she is leaving it.” According to Sartre, her inert hand places her in bad faith. She senses “profoundly the presence of her own body—to the point of being aroused, perhaps”; nevertheless, she contemplates her hand as if it belongs to someone else.70 Although this scene features prominently in Sartre's discussion of bad faith, it does not play a role in his subsequent discussion of erotic desire. By contrast, Girard sees in this scene a paradigmatic expression of triangulated desire that is especially illuminative of sexual desire.71 Girard establishes the coquette's significance for his theory: The coquette is indifferent to the overtures of her companion because her desire is directed elsewhere. Her own body is an object of desire.72 Girard claims that her indifference is “not feigned” (n'est pas simulée).73 Neither is it a true absence of desire; rather, “it is the other side of a desire for oneself.”74 That is why the coquette's indifference proves fascinating to the coquette's prospective lover. Coquetry emerges from contagion: “To speak of contagion is inevitably to speak of a second desire which is fixed on the same object as the original desire.”75 According to Girard, the man sitting across the table from the coquette “burns to acquire” the autonomy of being the coquette demonstrates; as a consequence, he is not the frustrated seducer Sartre has imagined. Instead, as he grasps the woman's hand, he is caught up in a dynamically contagious cycle of double mediation.76 Erotic desire, in thrall to the same mimetic passions that beset humans in all other contexts, leads not only the coquette but anyone caught in the triangle of sexual desire to desire their own body. When no gloss of romance remains to veil this desire, an increasingly common feature of sex in the modern era, erotic desire “has degenerated into onanism.”77Although one might hope for a partner in a sexual relationship who would be a model with whom to attain a unity of being promised by Eros, bliss eludes humans. Indeed, to the extent that one moves closer in a sexual relationship to an imagined moment of shared communion, Girard contends that one begins to notice flaws in one's partner that chip away at desire, eventually rendering the beloved undesirable.78 Describing masochism in ways similar to Sartre, Girard states that for the masochist, sexual desire focuses on the gap between the ideal object of desire and the masochist's own inadequacy. The masochist feels closest to that ideal when he or she is being subjected to brutalities he or she imagines would issue from that perfect being. The masochist does not want or “enjoy” suffering per se; rather, the masochist wants to be connected erotically to the model in the fullness of her being, and the masochist imagines that brutal or humiliating experiences will evoke that connection.79 Sadism reverses these dynamics. The sadist determines that unity with being has been achieved in the sexual encounter. But to effect this transformation, albeit a counterfeit one, the sadist must double with the victim, transforming the victim “into a replica of himself.” In that gesture may be found what Girard identifies as a “strange ‘communion’ between the victim and his tormentor.”80In whatever mode a lover seeks oneness with its model, possession of the model's body that would fill the subject's lack of being proves elusive.81 Even so, the subject does not abandon its quest for erotic satisfaction. Quoting Rougemont's commentary on romantic passion in Love in the Western World, Girard captures its fatal trajectory: “New obstacles have to be found in order to desire again and in order to exalt that desire to the proportions of a conscious, intense and continually interesting passion.” Thus, the subject doubles-down “like the driver who races his car a little faster every lap and must end up overturning.”82In the closing pages of Deceit, Desire and the Novel, Girard explains how great novelists are cured of metaphysical disease and experience conversion. Taking Proust as an example, Girard suggests that an empathic connection by Proust to others “triggers in him an aesthetic and spiritual illumination that transforms him completely.” Proust is freed of the compulsion of desire.83 Girard situates Proust's transformation within traditions of Christian conversion, likening the cork-lined bedroom in which Proust writes his novel to a monastic enclosure.84 Exploring how Proust's conversion changes his erotic desire, Girard compares transformation to “the tide rising over uneven ground.” “Little islands” remain after the sea has submerged everything else. Proust's homosexuality is one of these islands: Conversion is “rather slow to penetrate” his erotic desire and does not “definitively assert itself.” Nevertheless, in Proust's “greatest moments,” he “triumphs” over sadomasochism, breaking free of deviated transcendency.85 Stating that “Proustian eroticism is today the eroticism of the masses” and citing the end of Rougemont's Love in the Western World, Girard contrasts its masochistic features with the vertical transcendence of mystics in the Christian monastic tradition.86Proust is the only novelist whose sexual desire before and after conversion from metaphysical disease is discussed by Girard. In order to reflect on how Girard might have approached vertical transcendence across the expanse of other great novelists’ lives, inclusive of their erotic relationships, let's look more closely at the narrative Girard has commended to us: the end of Rougemont's Love in the Western World.87 Upholding Christian mysticism as a model of transcendence, Rougemont contrasts it with marriage in the modern world.

https://openalex.org/W4313452547,2023,Geography,"Piozzi and WalesMichael Franklin brings Hester Piozzi's Welsh heritage to the fore in this biography and, in detailed and incisive analyses of her works, examines the relationship between Piozzi's identity as a “Welshwoman” and her literary output (63).1 Drawing on a wide range of Piozzi's published writings and manuscript materials, Franklin makes an insightful contribution in an increasingly vibrant field of scholarship on Piozzi's life and work, intervening in discourses concerning national and cultural identities, politics, gender, and literary genre.In 1741, Hester Lynch Salusbury was born at Bodvel Hall, “three miles west of Pwllheli” (1). Her parents, John Salusbury of Bachegraig and Lleweni, and Hester Maria Lynch Cotton of Combermere, could claim “aristocratic Welsh blood” because “both descended from Catrin of Berain” (ix, 3). Throughout his chronologically structured biography, Franklin maintains that Piozzi was “a Welshwoman to the core and was proud to attribute all those characteristics . . . to what she had imbibed at her Caernarfonshire hearth and home” (63). Franklin claims that Piozzi's Welsh identity is not only apparent from her ancestry, but also attributes her characteristics and personality to a distinctive Celtic heritage. Piozzi is depicted as possessing a “wild, mercurial, and somewhat meretricious charm,” which Franklin states is a “stereotypical ‘Celtic’” characteristic that sits in opposition to a “rational English” identity (118). While Franklin shows Piozzi to have a “characteristic patience,” she is also an “Iron Lady,” actuated by her desire to please and perform, and it is these “characteristics,” acquired during her upbringing in Caernarfonshire and then at Lleweni Hall in Denbighshire, Franklin argues, that provided the foundation of Piozzi's literary career (48, 67). Although Franklin reflects that such qualities eventually enabled Piozzi to “support Samuel Johnson” selflessly, the overall thrust of his account of Piozzi is to decenter her association with Johnson (63). While Johnson remains an important influence on Piozzi's life and works, Franklin encourages the reader to view her instead as an original, independent author and intellectual. William McCarthy's seminal study, Hester Thrale Piozzi: Portrait of a Literary Woman (1985), as Franklin acknowledges, was the first convincingly to refute “the idea that Hester's literary career was entirely dependent on the commanding influence of Samuel Johnson” (15). However, by concentrating on a Welsh identity Piozzi acquired long before her association with Johnson, Franklin nuances McCarthy's insight, claiming yet greater autonomy for Piozzi's life and works.While recent scholarship has focused on the literary output of Piozzi's later years, Franklin effectively narrates the first twenty-one years of Piozzi's life, attending to the development of those traits which were to be the bedrock of her literary career. Extracting anecdotes from Autobiography, Letters, and Literary Remains of Mrs. Piozzi (Thrale) (1861), compiled by Abraham Hayward, Franklin emphasizes the significance of the illustrious acquaintances Piozzi made in her youth. He describes, for instance, “the celebrated artist William Hogarth, an intimate friend of her father,” joining “Hester and her cousins in playing the board Game of the Goose” (8). As a child in the 1740s, Piozzi “captivated the Duke and Duchess of Leeds, honing her performance skills while fed dramatic lines and delicious sweetmeats on David Garrick's lap, and being taught Satan's speech to the sun from Paradise Lost by James Quin, England's leading actor” (4). Perhaps most importantly, Franklin claims, “Earlier lessons learnt at Lleweni Hall and practised to perfection on Sir Robert Cotton ensured success as Hester now exerted her charm upon Sir Thomas and Lady Anna Salusbury” (6). Subsequently, Lady Salusbury grew to love Hester “as her own Daughter and destined Heiress” and arranged for Hester to receive tuition from Arthur Collier (7). Collier “championed female education,” and his conversation, Franklin argues, “was good practice” for Piozzi's later participation in literary circles where she would converse with the likes of Johnson and Elizabeth Montagu (9). In exploring these acquaintances, Franklin deftly proves that the connections Piozzi forged in her youth inspired and encouraged her, enabling her, over time, to cultivate her own literary identity.By the time Piozzi married Henry Thrale in 1763, she had already spent much time residing in London and at Offley Park in Hertfordshire. The amount of time Piozzi spent living outside of Wales might be expected to present an obstacle to Franklin's case for a distinctly Welsh identity. Indeed, Franklin shows that Piozzi's identity as a Welsh writer “concerned with achieving literary fame” became eclipsed by her new identities as a wife and mother (15). Whereas, in the early chapters, he depicted Piozzi as the performative, aspiring writer, Franklin shows that after marriage, “She did not seem to be in control of her own life or her own body” (29). The “Children's Book or rather Family Book” was a diary Piozzi kept from 1766 to 1768, and a project Johnson encouraged in order “to link reproduction and production by recording her daughter's physical and intellectual growth.” The book “subsequently served as an intimate diary to which she [Piozzi] confided her pent-up feelings” (39). Franklin's attention to Piozzi's personal writings, such as the “Family Book” and Thraliana, accords Piozzi agency during a period in her life when she was “totally mastered by two despotic personalities,” those of her husband and mother (26).Interestingly, Franklin also shows that it was London, and its fashionable society, that offered a space for Piozzi to display her inherent Welsh spirit. In the chapter entitled “Hester Brewster, or, ‘Women Have a Manifest Advantage over Men in the Doing Business,’” Franklin describes how, in 1768, the “resourceful Hester” wrote advertisements in support of her husband's electoral campaign, and in 1772, when Thrale faced bankruptcy, she was “drawn into taking an active managerial role in the family business” (55). London also offered Piozzi the opportunity to participate in more formal intellectual gatherings, such as those of the Bluestocking set, and eventually to establish her own salon at Streatham Park. While readers may be well familiar with the Bluestocking salon and the coterie at Streatham Park, Franklin presents a new account of Piozzi's social participation in salon culture. As “the world came to Streatham,” Piozzi's salon soon rivaled established “gatherings hosted by Frances Boscawen or Elizabeth Vesey” (38, 80). The salon, Franklin argues, offered a chance for Piozzi to put her “Celtic theatricality” (81) to use. He shows that these spaces were not only important because they provided Piozzi with intellectual and creative connections and inspiration, but also because the salon was an environment in which Piozzi's Welsh “hwyl” thrived (31).2Franklin punctuates the biography with extracts of Piozzi's prose and verse, which not only reveals the variety of her writing but also offers significant biographical insight. This is particularly evident in Piozzi's “best known poem,” “The Three Warnings: A Tale,” which first appeared in Anna Williams's Miscellanies in Prose and Verse (1766) and was “widely reprinted throughout the century in popular anthologies, miscellanies, chapbooks, and prints” (36). Franklin observes in his reading of the poem that “the fate of her [Piozzi's] baby, who had given up her life so placidly, as well as the declining health of her mother and uncle, had encouraged this poem's clear-eyed focus upon death” (34–35). Franklin also does justice to Piozzi's intellectual interests by emphasizing the variety of her own reading and her commentary on the literature she read. He suggests, for instance, that “Hester's fascination with all-female communities” in Observations and Reflections Made in the Course of a Journey Through France, Italy, and Germany (1798) was founded on her reading of Mary Astell's A Serious Proposal to the Ladies (1696–97), Samuel Richardson's Sir Charles Grandison (1753), and Sarah Scott's Millenium Hall (1762), and it was, in Piozzi's words, her reading of Joseph Warton's Essay on the Genius and Writings of Pope (1756) that “made a Writer & Critic of H:L:P” (73, 15).3In addition to the wealth of extracts from diaries, letters, marginalia, and verse, Franklin also provides generous introductions to Piozzi's most significant publications (all following her marriage to Gabriel Piozzi), including Anecdotes of the late Samuel Johnson (1786), Letters to and from the late Samuel Johnson (1788), Observations and Reflections (1798), British Synonymy (1794), and Retrospection (1801). Franklin's commentary on the critical reception of Piozzi's works provides useful introductory material and helps to contextualize these publications in the late eighteenth-century marketplace. For instance, the European Magazine and London Review mounted a “sustained attack” on Retrospection, “pronouncing that ‘female vanity never set itself forth more conspicuously not [sic] more absurdly, than in the assumption of universal knowledge which runs through the whole compilation’” (153). Franklin's detailed analyses of the texts provide original insight for new readers as well as for those already familiar with Piozzi's literary productions. Refreshingly, for example, in his account of the critical reception of Anecdotes, Franklin does not dwell on the well-rehearsed dissension between Piozzi and rival biographer James Boswell. Instead, Franklin again places Piozzi within the larger context of women writers dominating the literary marketplace in the period. It is Piozzi's “literary creativity” in these works, Franklin states, that reflects “not just a personal coming of age, but also the flowering of her whole generation” (102).Franklin's close readings consistently explain Piozzi's cultivation of a Welsh literary identity, best seen in the content and style of her major works. He observes that throughout British Synonymy, Piozzi stresses her Welsh heritage, picturing “herself as the eloquent Welsh author who . . . can ornament the English tongue through her compositions” (125). Franklin's examination of the style of Observations and Reflections, the publication that he argues best depicts Piozzi emerging “out of Johnson's shadow,” reveals her articulating a “Welsh-British identity” and celebrating “cultural diversity” (117, 102). In her diary, Frances Burney connects the style of Piozzi's travelogue with her character: “How like herself, how characteristic is every line! Wild, entertaining, flighty, inconsistent, and clever!” (118). Franklin reflects that the “wild, mercurial and somewhat meretricious charm” that Burney sees “draws on stereotypical ‘Celtic’ characteristics” (118).A valuable and comprehensive resource for students and scholars, Franklin's Hester Lynch Thrale Piozzi is an ambitious and thoughtful account, which, through a sustained concentration on Welsh cultural identity, produces new readings of Piozzi's works. His perceptive analysis of both major published texts and private writings provides a nuanced understanding of the influence that Welsh heritage, culture, and assumed national characteristics had on Piozzi's innovative and experimental literary and critical oeuvre. This biography contributes significantly to ongoing work that recognizes Piozzi as an author and intellectual in her own right. Franklin shows that Piozzi was not simply a writer born in Wales, but also a compelling Welsh writer who sought to establish herself at the forefront of a generation of women writers.",en

The Constitution in our country uses a term, separation of powers, but it regulates by dividing Chapter 3 National Assembly, Chapter 4 Government and Chapter 5 Court, and specifies strict separation of powers in its form. Article 40 regulates ‘the legislative power belongs to National Assembly’, indicating the principle of independent legislation of the National Assembly and National Assembly-centered legislation.

Article 2 of Constitution adopt the so-called legality of nationality by regulating ‘the requirements of nationals in the Republic of Korea are specified in laws, and the reason why it determines this as National Assembly Exclusive Legislative Matters is because the citizens with the nationality of the Republic of Korea are given the status of citizens as sovereigns, the people as state institutions, the people as subjects of fundamental rights and the people""s status as performers of duties.

The National Assembly formed with the representatives of people enacts the law about what is a crime and what is the punishment for it, which enables the ideal realization of Popular ssovereignty rule of law, liberalism, separation of powers. The Article 59 of Constitution regulates the tax legalism by specifying ‘the item and the rate of tax is regulated in law. The reason why to regulate tax legalism as National Assembly Exclusive Legislative Matters is to prohibit unilateral and arbitrary imposition and collection by the administration against the taxation that forces the payment of tax from people without pay in return. Article 96 of Constitution regulates the government organization legalism by specifying the establishment, organization and scope of duties of each administrative department shall be determined by law. The purpose is to check the administration by realizing the separation of power for National Assembly, a legislature to regulate the basic matters of each administrative department. National Assembly should not execute the exclusive legislative power in terms of formality but allow the freedom and rights of people are realized practically and ideally, and should be more faithful to the legislation that supports so that the function of nation can be realized to the fullest in a diversified modern society in the composition of administrative organizations.",en

Therefore, the government established the Judicial Commission of the Republic of Indonesia to maintain the dignity and dignity of the courts in Indonesia. This study discusses how the Judicial Commission of the Republic of Indonesia plays a role in handling the Contempt of Court in Indonesia from the perspective of Islamic Legal Thought. This research is literature with a qualitative approach. Data was collected through literature studies in the form of laws, books, and journals. The collected data is analyzed descriptively with a deductive model. This research shows that the Judicial Commission has been essential in preventing the Contempt of Court in Indonesia. The Judicial Commission of the Republic of Indonesia carries preventive and repressive actions. Preventive actions are carried out to avoid the Contempt of Court, while repressive actions are carried out to deal with the Contempt of Court in Indonesia. In Islamic legal thought, the role of the Judicial Commission is according to the role of Diwan al-Hisbah and the rule of Islamic Law ""dar' al-mafasid muqaddam ala jalb al-mashalih"" (rejecting harm is prioritized over bringing benefit) and ""al-dharar yuzal"" (damage must be eliminated). The role of the Judicial Commission in resolving Contempt of Court cases can make courts a safe place to enforce the law in Indonesia.",en

That is why understanding of legal meaning of NATO standards is so important for the determination of most effective ways of implementation of NATO standards and relevant procedures because it quite a large volume of technical prescriptions and rules that are complex and unusual for legal system of Ukraine. Military standardization and certification of weapons and military equipment in Ukraine according to NATO standards should take into account specific international law processes like adoption, ratification, implementation, change and cancellation of regulatory requirements. The purpose of the military standardization is to achieve, maintain and improve the interoperability of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with the armed forces of NATO and NATO member states on the base of interchangeability and uniformity of harmonized terminology in the field security and defense. In its legal nature the NATO standard is an international agreement that regulates and defines common rules in the field of defense joint procedures and establishes the unification of technical processes, weapons and military techniques. Therefore, the concept of “NATO standard” should consider precisely in the extended meaning, not in y narrow understanding, as it defined be Ukrainian legislation. National legislation provides definition of NATO standard as document that developed, adopted and published Organization of the North Atlantic Treaty. Such definition too narrowly reflects the complex nature of that international legal phenomenon and our country faces the necessity to review normative definition of multilevel system of NATO standardization. Solving the problem of interoperability of the security and defense sector of Ukraine with NATO is required through the creation of common conceptual and categorical conditions of standardization.

Medical care is based on a number of regulatory legal acts that have defined the federal structure of the healthcare system and the rules of financing. National laws define the principles of healthcare organization in order to provide timely quality medical care to the entire population of the State. The peculiarities of Indian healthcare is the fact that society is divided on many grounds, that is, into religion, castes, races, skin color and political parties. These features lead to health inequalities. The Constitution of India establishes that human rights relating to life, freedom, equality and dignity of the individual are guaranteed by the Constitution itself, International Covenants and are subject to enforcement by the courts of India. These provisions triggered the creation of new executive bodies in the field of health: the National Human Rights Commission, as well as Human Rights Commissions in all states and courts. According to international experts, India’s medical innovation activity is rated as one of the most progressive forms (creativity and efficiency) in global healthcare. Such a result is not accidental, since India’s role in global health is based on an adequate domestic national medical policy.",en

It is embroiled in the historical subjugation of the ‘weaker sex.’ Women have been unable to claim equality in society despite mandatory provisions in the Constitution of India and other legislations in their favour. Despite numerous amendments to the Indian criminal law, rape, one of the most heinous crimes, continues to be committed in India at an alarming rate. The law on Rape in India has undergone three phases of amendments, and all precipitated in the aftermath of public fury on account of brutal and heinous incidents of rape. This paper employs the socio-legal approach to assess the efficacy and impact of these amendments in changing social behaviour. It concludes that though the massive public outrage undoubtedly led to radical amendments, it was a knee-jerk reaction that suffered from legislative ambiguities. The increase in the retributive content of the law ultimately resulted in reduced convictions. Although law is believed to be an instrument of social change, the amendments in the anti-rape legislation have been unable to bring about a positive transformation in the existing cultural inequality.",en

When a bill is submitted to the Senate or House of Representatives in Congress, it is referred to the Standing Committee for a hearing to determine whether the bill will be adopted or modified. Once adopted, the bill will be brought to the plenary session for debate and voting. Thus, the passed bill will be transferred to another circle, namely, the Senate bill will be transferred to the House of Representatives and the House of Representatives bill will be transferred to the Senate, where the same procedure will be taken.

The Commission recommends “an Africa-led, Africa-owned, Africa-resourced legal mechanism, under the aegis of the African Union and with support from the United Nations, to bring those with the greatest responsibility at the highest level to accountability” in a court. Second, the Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan asked for establishing a hybrid court in South Sudan to investigate and prosecute the perpetrators of “genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes”. The Cabinet of South Sudan approved, in its resolution on 29 January 2021, the establishment of the court. On the other hand, the Government of South Sudan rejected accountability for the perpetrators of international crimes in its resolution at the Transition Justice Conference and recommended “amnesty” for those admitting the commission of international crimes in Juba, Malakal, Bor and Bentiu. The research findings show that amnesty threatens peace and security because customary law rejects amnesty. Its implementation generates systematic vengeance from the clan of those killed. The research recommends the establishment of a hybrid court that adopts the complementarity principle in compatibility with the African customary law of blood compensation. The authoritative national criminal courts in South Sudan omit capital punishment on the grounds that (a) killer(s) pay(s) blood compensation, apok or cot , to the survivors of (a) killed person(s) with 51 cattle.

Across hospitals in the United States, routine shackling of incarcerated patients with metal handcuffs is widespread, except for pregnant prisoners, regardless of consciousness, immobility, illness severity, or age. The modified policy includes individualized assessment and allows incarcerated patients to be unshackled if they meet defined criteria. The students also formed the Stop Shackling Patients Coalition (SSP Coalition) of clinicians, public health practitioners, human rights advocates, and community members who share the goal of humanizing the inpatient treatment of incarcerated patients.IntroductionRoutine shackling of incarcerated patients with metal handcuffs is widespread in hospitals across the United States (US), with the exception of pregnant prisoners. Despite harmful effects on patients and national attention to health equity, incarcerated patients are routinely shackled regardless of consciousness, immobility, illness severity, or age.1,2 A large cohort study (n = 1078) of Israeli hospitals found that 84% of incarcerated patients who have severely impaired mobility for medical reasons are shackled, nonetheless.3 The discriminatory and dehumanizing practice of routinely applying shackles to incarcerated patients exacerbates existing care disparities by violating both medical ethics and human rights principles. The 2018 federal First Step Act prohibited “the shackling of pregnant prisoners in federal custody, except in certain cases.”4 As the name of this criminal justice bill suggests, the ban did not entirely eliminate shackling and the practice continues to impact nonpregnant incarcerated patients.5There is a common misconception amongst healthcare professionals that they cannot influence the use of shackles to restrain their patients. By not challenging this practice within our healthcare institutions, the correctional system essentially governs aspects of patient care. Protocols for shackling incarcerated patients can and must be changed to respect human dignity and health, while simultaneously providing safety in the workplace.6-9Harms to IndividualsShackling impacts physical health in several ways. In the hospital setting, restraints can result in skin breakdown, circulation compromise, compressive neuropathies, fractures, increased fall risk, increased risk of delirium, and predisposition to severe vascular injury.6,8,10,11 Clinicians may be limited in their ability to perform a thorough physical examination.8Clinician bias against the shackled patient may also harm the clinician-patient relationship. In fact, the presence of shackles negatively affects empathy, precipitates diagnostic skepticism and elicits unsubstantiated fears of personal harm by the patient.6 Shackles have led to insensitive, inappropriate, neglectful, or abusive actions by staff or associated authority figures, which in turn evokes a response of fear in patients along with a loss of trust in the care team.12 These negative healthcare interactions further stress incarcerated patients’ post-carceral challenges within the healthcare system.13Human Rights ViolationsRoutine shackling of incarcerated patients violates foundational international human rights principles, including those contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.14-16 These principles are designed to protect human dignity and protect persons from discrimination and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. Shackling patients who are critically ill or at the end of life is an affront to their human dignity, and increases pain and suffering in this vulnerable time. Routine shackling violates the United Nations (UN) Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (The Nelson Mandela Rules) – the internationally accepted standard for the treatment of prisoners.17 Rule 48 addresses the use of restraints. See Box 1. Box 1: UN Standard Minimum Rules (The Nelson Mandela Rules) Rule 48 When the imposition of instruments of restraint is authorized in accordance with paragraph 2 of rule 47, the following principles shall apply: (a) Instruments of restraint are to be imposed only when no lesser form of control would be effective to address the risks posed by unrestricted movement; (b) (c) The method of restraint shall be the least intrusive method that is necessary and reasonably available to control the prisoner’s movement, based on the level and nature of the risks posed; Instruments of restraint shall be imposed only for the time period required, and they are to be removed as soon as possible after the risks posed by unrestricted movement are no longer present. Instruments of restraint shall never be used on women during labor, during childbirth and immediately after childbirth. In accordance with these Mandela Rules and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the head of the British prison service proclaimed that the “shackling of patients in hospital[s] should not occur,” emphasizing that “security is important, but it should never blind us to the overriding need for compassion and humanity.”18, 19 In the Netherlands, chains are never used and handcuffs are used only in exceptional circumstances.20 Our work amended shackling practices to introduce a risk-stratified, individualized protocol for American hospitals that aligns with human rights principles better upheld by Western nations. 21, 22From Changing Hospital Policy to Launching a National Movement We began by writing and circulating a petition to local hospital affiliates and community members to raise awareness and support.23 The petition then spread nationally, amassing 780 signatures across 129 institutions. The response demonstrated a consensus for change that enabled us to engage the hospital’s executive leadership in policy reform. Next, we solicited input from key hospital stakeholders including public safety and patient-facing staff such as nurses, as well as medical, nursing leadership, and legal hospital leadership. Identifying shared values for patient care helped generate feedback to balance concerns for safety and liability with human dignity. We then engaged with hospital administration and proposed a modification to existing hospital policy. Following multiple meetings with and input from key stakeholders, the policy on shackling incarcerated patients was officially modified in February 2023. The core of the modified policy is a process that allows for the removal or modification of shackling in certain incarcerated patients and provides hospital personnel with a detailed protocol for the assessment and implementation of this policy. The policy outlines a schema for communication and decision-making among carceral facilities, hospital security, and the patient’s healthcare team with the goal of providing dignified and humane care to incarcerated patients while maintaining hospital security. The discourse around shackling practices reached beyond the walls of our hospital, inciting a national discussion not only regarding the issue of shackling patients but how this practice could be brought to an end. In parallel to the conversations we were leading and progress we were making within Boston Medical Center, we also launched the Stop Shackling Patients Coalition (SSP) – a body of clinicians, public health practitioners, human rights advocates, and community members who share the goal of humanizing the inpatient treatment of incarcerated patients. SSP has now grown into a diverse task force and learning collaborative that meets to empower healthcare institutions from across the United States to change their shackling policies.",en

It also offers a historical contextualization of the source, found in the Archivio Bevilacqua Ariosti in Bologna. The instructions reflect a change in Papal diplomacy, which remained active among the European powers even after the peace of Westphalia. By sending a nuncio into Protestant territory, Pope Innocent XI’s curia increasingly tended to integrate itself into the secularising diplomacy. During the peace negotiations, the Holy See tried to fulfil its ideal role as a padre comune , entailing strict impartiality between the conflicting Catholic parties. The orders regarding contacts with Protestant actors and interests are an example of the flexible dialogue of a normative text with the changing circumstances of 17th-century diplomatic practice. Although the wording reflects the intransigent tradition of the Holy See, the instructions show clear signs that the Protestant presence at the congress was handled pragmatically. On site, Bevilacqua even tried to go further and expand the recently established norm in favour of an effective interaction with Protestants, but ultimately failed.",en

The agreement on the results of the formulation of new plenary legal rules of this chamber has been held every year since 2012, especially judicial technical discussions in handling cases in each chamber of the Supreme Court. So, this Chamber System is based on the specialization of the field of law mastered by each Supreme Court justice. That way, Supreme Court justices can only handle cases according to their expertise. Since the introduction of the chamber system to the Supreme Court, each chamber periodically holds chamber plenary meetings. The plenary meeting of the chamber serves as a forum for the Supreme Court justices to discuss the resolution of legal issues that have not been shared among the Supreme Court justices. The research method used is the normative juridical method, namely research that prioritizes literature data, namely research on secondary data. The secondary data can be primary, secondary or tertiary legal material.

(구)국방경비법이 시행된 이래 지금까지 군대 내 특별 사법절차로서 존립해왔고, 군사법원법에 근거하여 군사법원·군검찰 및 군사경찰의 권한은 군 지휘관의 지휘권 확립수단으로 중요한 기능을 담당하여 왔다. 따라서 향후의 군대 내 사법(司法)에 관한 연구는 군사법원의 존립여부를 벗어나 군사법원 및 군검찰, 형사절차에 대한 내용이어야 할 것이다. 개정된 군사법원법은 개정이 미치는 파급력을 충분히 고려하지 못한 채 군대 내 성범죄 사건의 처리에 관한 불신을 해소하기 위하여 급하게 개정되었다. 그러나 군대 내 사법절차는 앞서 설명한 바와 같이 군사법원에 재판권이 있는 형사사건의 당사자와 군대 내 지휘관 및 부대 장병 모두에게 영향을 미치는 중대한 절차로서 그 개정에는 많은 고심이 필요하다. 따라서 본 논문에서는 개정 군사법원법의 내용을 살펴보고 이에 대한 개선방안을 제시하여 보았다. The Military Court Act was revised on July 1, 2022. There have been some significant changes in the military""s criminal procedures centered around the Military Court Act, and there are voices of dissatisfaction from those involved. Military criminal cases affect not only the parties involved but also the commanding officers and their subordinates who effectively command the unit, so greater preparation is needed for the revision process of this content. In particular, due to recent issues regarding sexual crimes in the military, field commanders are struggling with the military""s criminal and disciplinary procedures, including sexual crime cases within their units. The Military Court Act becomes the legal basis for the existence and operation of the military police, military prosecutors, and military courts. Previous discussions on the Military Court Act have mainly focused on whether the existence and operation of the military courts violate the constitutional basic rights of the people from a constitutional perspective. This is because, apart from the constitutional provision in Article 110, which presents the constitutional basis for the military court as a special court within the military, the law delegates organizational, jurisdictional, and judicial qualifications concerning its operation separately. The military court has existed as a special judicial procedure within the military since the Enforcement of the former National Defense Security Act on August 4, 1948, and based on the Military Court Act, the military court, military rosecutors, and military police have been responsible for important functions as a means of establishing the commanding officer""s command authority. Therefore, future studies on judicial procedures within the military should focus on research on the specific contents of the military court, military prosecutors, and criminal procedures, beyond the existence of the military court. The revised Military Court Act was quickly amended to alleviate concerns about handling sexual crime cases within the military without sufficient consideration of the ramifications of the revision. However, as explained earlier, military judicial procedures, which involve criminal cases with the military court""s jurisdiction, affect both the parties involved and the commanding officers and their subordinate troops in the military. Therefore, significant preparation is needed for the revision process. This article examines the revision content of the Military Court Act, discusses individual problems related to the revision, and reviews them.",en

https://openalex.org/W4379380739,2023,Political science,"Valeska Bopp-Filimonov and Martin Jung, eds. <i>Kaleidoskop Rumänien. Einblicke in die aktuelle Vielfalt des interdisziplinären Faches Rumänistik</i>As a metaphor, the kaleidoscope stands for different modes of being that arise from the same set of particles. It is a frequently used (if not to say: slightly worn) image in journalism and scientific publications. In this volume, it serves as a bracket for the study of Romanian society in its various transdisciplinary facets, from regional, historical, landscape, ethnic, linguistic, and religious perspectives. However, the texts presented here are far more original than the title and will hopefully find a wide readership.The thematic range of the volume extends temporally from the mid-nineteenth century to the present and disciplinarily across the breadth of cultural and literary studies. A thematic focus can be discerned in the majority of the contributions in the aftermath of Socialist politics and economics up to the present and the literary examination of this.The publication was prompted by the thematically broad workshop “Romania in Focus,” which took place in Regensburg in 2019. The binding bracket of the anthology is thus “Romania”—a geopolitical territory, a nation-state, a society, a cultural space—as a research object. It places “people and spaces” at the center of consideration. In doing so, the editors take up a central challenge of transdisciplinary regional studies and especially of those that are always fighting for their existence as “small subjects”: the ideological deconstruction of a unified nation-state and the description of the (re)production of a nation-state with its centrifugal and centripetal forces, without abolishing the subject of the discipline.The tensions between real linguistic, religious, and cultural diversity, as well as the ideal of transnational exchange (as, for example, discussed in Heubaum’s contribution) and multinational statehood (Große’s and Bacali’s texts) and simultaneous nationalist and monocultural aspirations (Dácz, Heubaum), are thus thematized. The discussion of transnational and intra-societal political and economic inequalities (Bopp-Filimonov, Bacali, Biro, Rammelt) contributes to the pertinence of the volume. The authors of the volume succeed in focusing on the overlapping and differently shaped historical, cultural, and linguistic spaces in the area of so-called “modern Romania” and in their confrontation and interdependence with what counts as “Romanian.”The volume is divided into three thematic blocks.“Spaces of Interference and Cultural Overlap” is devoted to the coexistence of ethnic and religious groups. Enikő Dácz analyses how the Transylvanian press dealt with local and regional conflicts in Transylvania at the beginning of the twentieth century. Of great interest for the present is the negotiation of ethical journalistic standards with regard to dealing with false reports and the effect of reports on, for example, fisticuffs. Johann Wellner is on the linguistic trail of the remaining German Bohemians in Bukovina. Martin Jung meticulously traces the history of Catholic journeymen’s associations in Romania from their first founding in 1859 to their banning in 1949 under Communist rule. A clearer political and historical classification would have been desirable here, when an upswing is observed precisely for the 1930s, which is explained with the preservation of “Germanness” outside the “Reich.”The second thematic block, “Ideal Reference Spaces and Imagined Belongings,” deals with geographical spaces. Specifically, it is about the identification or confrontation with Socialist Yugoslavia, Europe, and the (own) nation. Gundel Große analyzes the novel Disco Titanic by the Romanian author Radu Pavel Gheo, who explores the cross-border space of the historical region of Banat and the neighboring Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia. The character’s longing for “the multinational ideal of the Yugoslav state” (p. 75) is a highly topical motif at a time when nationalist forces proclaim a monoethnic nation in complete denial of reality and when wars and conflicts in multiethnic states are repeatedly wrongly explained by the failure of multinational states and federations. What is also exciting about this is the external perspective: far beyond the immediate physical, economic, and psychological consequences of the wars for the population, hopes are destroyed and longings are violated for all those who dream of diverse models of state and citizenship and repeatedly seek to defend them against nationalist narratives. A transnational space of reference also emerges through a media space in the form of Yugoslav television and rock music. Miruna Bacali discusses the “geography of inequality” in the novel Adio, Europa! by Ion D. Sîrbu, written during late communism. She uses this dystopia as a comparative foil with restrictions on freedom and a simultaneous appeal for solidarity under the current global pandemic restrictions. Insightful are the demarcations between East and West, as well as the resulting concept of Europe and the Western double standards of defining belonging, which come to light through the protagonist’s simultaneous positioning inside and outside Europe (p. 103).Felix Heubaum examines the nation concepts of three well-known Romanian dissidents of the 1980s—Monica Lovinescu, Doina Cornea, and Vlad Georgescu. Even though these individuals countered the “official” nationalism of the Communist regime, their understanding of nationhood was also primarily ethnic, spiritual-religious, and ruralist. Overall, they thus continued formative discourses from the interwar period and fascism. Even if they saw themselves in clear contradiction to the Communist regime, their understanding of the nation coincided on essential points with that of the regime.The article by Daniel Biro presents partial results of his quantitative linguistic analysis of presidential speeches in the period 1993 to 2004 (Ion Iliescu and Emil Constantinescu). Focusing on the aspects of solidarity and exclusion, he looks at a domestic political discourse that is increasingly characterized by emotions, with trust and foresight playing particularly important roles. These are closely related to the development of accession negotiations for the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The study is based on a corpus of impressive size, but it only marginally places the observed discursive developments in the sociopolitical circumstances from which they spring.The third thematic block, “Lifeworldly and Symbolic Appropriations of Space,” opens with Jana Stöxen’s ethnographic field study of everyday life in a Bucharest apartment block, which describes the city’s recent temporal, architectural, and social history from the perspective of a participant observer of people and space in this microcosm.Valeska Bopp-Filimonov ties in with “post-industrial memories” (p. 185) when she looks at another relic of Socialist architecture: she analyzes the literariness as well as the role and function of industrial ruins in two novels. These become the backdrop for the protagonists who fail in the so-called transformation. The author describes a contrast between the working class and intellectuals that has never been overcome. In this study, literature is seen as a “(life) experience sphere.” The literary examination is consistently linked with the reflection of real multimodal discourses on the basis of the symbolic meaning of industrial ruins in the illustration of newspaper articles.Finally, Henry Rammelt investigates the spatial dimensions of the waves of protest in Bucharest after the end of Communist rule. The demonstrations of the more recent protests took place around public authorities and government buildings, indicating the (new) substantive thrust of the protests, which were increasingly oriented toward day-to-day political issues.",en

Here, the aim was to consider concerning the judicial decision made by the Constitutional Court in relation to this case focusing on the guarantee of the freedom of political expression in social service personnel performing mandatory military service and on its limitations in reference to this case. First of all, through the 2016 Heonma 252 decision in the sentence on Oct. 27, 2016, the Constitutional Court has already made the decision of constitutionality as for ‘whether or not the freedom of the election campaign’ in a public service worker in the same article with object to adjudication. Based on this decision, it clearly identified that a public service worker has the public status equivalent to that of a public official as a person of performing public duty and has the political neutrality in light of its position and duty, along with the meaning of a public service worker. In sequence, through 2016 Heonma 252 that is the decision of this case, it examined with regard to restricting ‘political party’ affiliation out of Article 33, Paragraph 2, Text No. 2 in the Military Service Act as the article with object to adjudication. There was also an objection that the complete ban on the political party membership goes against the principle of excess prohibition in consideration of what the claimant in this case is a social service worker and of the characteristics of the duties in public service workers. However, taking into account the characteristics of the status in social service personnel fulfilling their military service obligation and the relationship with other military service performers, it agrees to what the Constitutional Court's decision as saying of not infringing on the freedom of political expression and the freedom of association is reasonable even if applying the principle of excess prohibition, which is the standard for examination. And then, it observed carefully concerning ‘Act with political purpose such as joining other political organizations, etc.’ out of Article 33, Paragraph 2, Text No. 2 in the Military Service Act as the article with object to adjudication in 2019 Heonma 534 that is the decision of this case. Like modern society, guaranteeing the freedom of political expression, which is the basis of democracy, is an important right that must be assured preferentially in the relationship with other fundamental rights, should be deliberate when trying to limit these rights, and needs to be clearer in the case of penal provision. In this sense, ‘other political organizations’ and ‘act with political purpose’ violate the principle of clarity and may not be definite even by the supplementary interpretation of the law enforcer. Thus, the Constitutional Court's decision on unconstitutionality was confirmed to be a desirable direction even for laying down a more accurate regulation.",en

It is determined that an extremely important direction of the state's activity is the obligation to support and ensure the protection of the rights and legitimate interests of a person and a citizen in every possible way, which is partially achieved due to the activities of the bar. Today, the institution of procedural representation of lawyers is quite important, since it ensures the effectiveness of the implementation of procedural rights and obligations of interested parties. The main prerequisite for the emergence of a legal relationship involving a lawyer as a representative should be the lawyer's voluntary legal action, his active procedural activity, which simultaneously determines the content of the legal relationship. Representation of a client by a lawyer in administrative proceedings requires the lawyer to be professional and qualified to provide legal assistance. A lawyer who represents the interests of his client in administrative proceedings is an active participant in the court process, the goal of which is to achieve the best legal result in the case for him. The powers of a lawyer in accordance with the Law of Ukraine ""On Advocacy and Advocacy"" are evidenced by a warrant, a mandate from bodies or institutions authorized by law to provide free legal aid, or a contract on the provision of legal aid. An important aspect of the activity of the bar is the proper consolidation of its rights and obligations.

On 11 April 2002, the number of ratifications exceeded the threshold set by the Statute for its entry into force. This means that the Statute became effective on 1 July 2002. As of 10 February 2003. 89 States had ratified the Statute. Poland signed the Statute on 9 April 1999. However, ratification posed a number of problems due to the need to resolve the issue of the compatibility of certain provisions of the Statute with the 1997 Constitution. Although the request for ratification was submitted to the Sejm as early as December 2000, the law authorising the President of the Republic of Poland to perform ratification was passed by the Sejm on 5 July 2001, and was subsequently approved by the Senate in early August. In the Polish legal system, the legal and juridical language rarely uses the term 'jurisdiction' (the Code of Civil Procedure may be a certain exception), in the Polish language we would rather say ‘competence’ than jurisdiction. Therefore, the term needs to be clarified taking into account the specificity of the International Criminal Court. Jurisdiction should be construed as the right of a given authority to adjudicate a case that is not purely national but has an international element. Due to the international dimension of jurisdiction, it must be assumed that in this case the right to adjudicate a case arises as a result of a dispute of competence between two subjects of international law (states). The issue of criminal jurisdiction comes to the fore particularly when an authority is to rule on a foreign national. The traditional understanding of jurisdiction cannot be simply applied to the ICC. This definition needs to be modified. Firstly, in the case of the Court, the competence (jurisdictional) dispute is not between two states, but between an international body and a state. Secondly, the international aspect is revealed not by the nationality of the perpetrator but by the crime itself. Indeed, the Court will adjudicate on the most serious crimes of international importance. Thirdly, the dispute of competence between the parties is formalised, i.e. the rules and the procedure for its resolution are strictly defined in the Statute. It is also characteristic of the lack of equivalence between the State and the Court in this dispute. On the one hand, the state is in a privileged position, as it enjoys priority in the exercise of jurisdiction under the principle of complementarity. On the other hand, however, the overarching and dominant role of the Court as the body that will resolve the competence dispute is clearly in view. The subject of this study is only that part of the complex issue of the ICC's jurisdiction that concerns the clarification of its scope, in its various dimensions: subject matter, time and persons. One can speak here of the 'static elements' of the jurisdiction. Outside the scope of consideration is the mechanism for triggering jurisdiction, that is, the question of initiating and continuing proceedings before the Court or its authorities. Similarly, they can be referred to as the 'kinetic elements' of the jurisdiction.",en

https://openalex.org/W4386420145,2023,Political science,"A Legal Study on the Improvement of the Appeal System for EducatorsThe Appeal System for Educators is an essential system for protecting educators' rights and is currently working well. However, there are many things to improve. Especially as the decline of teaching power is becoming more widespread, affecting even the preference for the teaching profession, it is more necessary than ever to find ways to improve The appeal system for educators to restore the stability of the teaching staff and to encourage them to teach with confidence as education professionals. Under these circumstances, we looked at the problems of the current school cleaning system and ways to improve it. First of all, it is necessary to expand the claimant qualification and claim targets in the Appeal for Educators, as expanding the avenues for educators who have been unfairly or excessively disciplined in the field of education to complain about their unfairness and receive relief is the starting point for protecting the status and rights of educators. Specifically, national university lecturers, who are appointed through a similar process to full-time faculty and perform the same duties, should be granted the right to file a complaint. In addition, the need to allow appeals for warnings and cautions, which are essentially no different from unwritten warnings, needs to be seriously and actively examined. In addition, recognizing the administrative action of private school educator discipline and granting the right to apply for an administrative stay should be interpreted prospectively. The operation of the Appeal Commission for Educators should also allow reconciliation and mediation at the educator appeal stage, and the scope of grievance claims, which is currently very narrow, should be interpreted more broadly so that conflicts and work difficulties in education can be resolved quickly and accurately. Some of these improvements are interpretive and some are legislative. And when these system improvements are made, the burden of work on the Appeal Commission for Educators will inevitably increase. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the efficiency and professionalism of the work by expanding the organization of the Appeal Commission for Educators and deploying more experts qualified as lawyers. In addition, it is also necessary to consider separating kindergarten, elementary, and secondary school teachers from university educators as a way to further enhance the professionalism of the Appeal Commission for Educators.",en

In late-feudal Georgia, the judicial institution was called „secretary“, it is an Arabic word and it meant a judicial and state institution. The official appointed to perform a special judicial function was called Mdivanbegi. Mdivanbeg was a judge whose competence included various types of civil and criminal cases. Mdivanbeg's court was usually collegial. The court was attended by a secretary, whose duty was to record the testimony of the parties, to find the appropriate article of the legal book; &nbsp;Secretaries were also considered members of the court and took part in deciding cases. These people would carry out the course of the accusation process that we are studying.

From the perspective of lifestyle politics theory, this study used a survey (N = 913) to explore the factors that are associated with two responses to corporate political advocacy––consumer digital engagement in response to corporate political advocacy (CDE-CPA) and political consumerism (i.e., buycotting and boycotting). The findings suggested different mechanisms for CDE-CPA and political consumerism. We found that weekday social media usage is positively associated with CDE-CPA but negatively associated with buycotting. Also, extraverted individuals prefer to engage in CDE-CPA activities but not political consumerism; and emotionally stable individuals tend to engage in buycotting and high-CDE activities to support corporate political advocacy.",en

On April 21, 2022, by Decree of the President of Ukraine No.266/2022, the National Council for the Recovery of Ukraine from the Consequences of the War was established as a consultative and advisory body under the President of Ukraine, and the Regulations on it and its staff were approved. The National Council prepared the Plan for the Reconstruction of Ukraine after the war and presented it at the international conference in Lugano on July 4–5, 2022 as a “road map” for the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine. And since in the conditions of the war unleashed by the Russian Federation in Ukraine, the right to participate in the management of state affairs is limited, there was no extensive discussion of this Plan. However, the issues that arose in the process of its preparation and adoption are quite relevant. Aim of the article – is to clarify the correspondence of the powers of the National Council for the Recovery of Ukraine from the Consequences of the War to its legal status as a consultative body under the President of Ukraine, the legal force of acts adopted by it and the problems of their implementation. Results. The issue of the legal status of consultative and advisory bodies, bodies that serve the President’s activities, has been the subject of scientific debate in legal science for a long time. There is also an attempt to define the concept of a consultative body in the current legislation of Ukraine. For example, in accordance with the Standard Regulation on the advisory, advisory and other auxiliary bodies established by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine (hereinafter – the Standard Regulation), approved by the resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine “Issues of advisory, advisory andother auxiliary bodies established by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine” dated June 17 No. 599 of 2009, the consultative and advisory body is a permanent or temporary body of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine (hereinafter referred to as an auxiliary body), which is formed by it to ensure the exercise of its powers. As for consultative-advisory bodies under the President of Ukraine, efforts at the normative level to regulate their status were made in the Decree of the President of Ukraine dated May 3, 2006 No. 340/2006 “On some issues of regulating the activity of consultative-advisory bodies under the President of Ukraine”. However, on the basis of Presidential Decree No. 149/2008 of February 21, 2008, it became invalid. And the draft Law of Ukraine “On the office of the President, advisory, advisory and other auxiliary bodies and services that ensure the exercise of powers by the President of Ukraine” dated September 24, 2008 No. 3215 was not adopted. On the basis of the analysis of scientific and normative sources regarding the definition of the concept of “consultative and advisory body”, it can be stated that the features of the concept of “consultative and advisory body” proposed by legal scholars mostly coincide with the features established in the current regulatory and legal acts.The defining characteristics of the National Council as a consultative body under the President of Ukraine are as follows: it is an auxiliary body by nature of its activity; created on the basis of a separate Regulation approved by the Decree of the President of Ukraine dated April 21, 2022 No. 266/2022; the main task is to develop a plan of measures for the post-war recovery and development of Ukraine; definition and development of proposals for priority reforms, the adoption and implementation of which are necessary in the war and post-war periods; preparation of strategic initiatives, projects of regulatory and legal acts, the adoption and implementation of which are necessary for the effective work and recovery of Ukraine in the war and post-warperiods; not endowed with state-authority powers; does not have the right to issue normative-legal acts on its own behalf, but is authorized to participate in the development of draft normative-legal acts regarding the recovery of Ukraine from the consequences of the war and to submit to the President of Ukraine the relevant recommendations and proposals developed based on the results of its work. It is worth paying attention to the binding nature of the provisions of the Plan for the Reconstruction of Ukraine after the war, adopted by the consultative and advisory body under the President of Ukraine. Clause 11 of the Regulations on the National Council states that “the Council shall make decisions on matters within its jurisdiction”. But such decisions of the advisory body are not binding for anyone. But such decisions of the advisory body are not binding for anyone. If necessary, the decisions of the Council can be implemented by issuing acts of the President ofUkraine, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine in accordance with the established procedure, and introducing relevant draft laws for consideration by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. But the main purpose of the National Council under the President of Ukraine, as we have already noted, is to submit to the President of Ukraine appropriate recommendations and proposals regarding priority reforms developed based on the results of its work, the adoption and implementation of which are necessary in the war and post-war periods; including the preparation of strategic initiatives, projects of normative and legal acts. And the President of Ukraine and the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine can respectively issue Decrees and Resolutions only on matters defined forthem by the Constitution of Ukraine. Conclusions. In the conditions of the martial law regime and the deficit of budget funds, the creation of additional consultative and advisory bodies in general, not authorized to make universally binding decisions, and in particular the National Council for the Recovery of Ukraine from the Consequences of the War as aconsultative and advisory body under the President of Ukraine, seems quite problematic. After all, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine as the highest body of executive power in Ukraine and the system of executive power bodies in general, according to the Constitution of Ukraine and the Laws of Ukraine, has sufficient powers to ensure the adoption and implementation of the necessary regulatory and legal acts on post-war reconstruction and development of Ukraine. Key words: National Council for the Recovery of Ukraine from the Consequences of the War, consultative and advisory body under the President of Ukraine, Plan for the Recovery of Ukraine after the War, martial law regime, system of executive authorities.",en

The constitutionality of the closed proportional system has been the subject of ongoing debate. This study uses a qualitative approach with normative juridical methods to analyze the constitutionality of general legislative elections that use a closed proportional system. This approach involved collecting data from legal documents, literature studies, and court decisions that were relevant to this topic. The results of the study showed that the application of a closed proportional system in legislative general elections has several constitutional implications, such as the limitation of political access for individuals outside of political parties, which can be considered as a violation of the individual's constitutional right to participate in the political process.

Respect and protection of human rights is one of the leading principles of international law, enshrined in international legal treaties. All countries must adhere to the principles of freedom, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.Human rights, which are enshrined in current international legal treaties, are the result of the long-term historical development of social and political thought, the gradual formation of standards that have become the norm for the life of a modern democratic society. The author examines the provisions of the most famous international documents related to the protection of human rights during an armed conflict: the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the additional protocol to the Geneva Conventions of , relating to the protection of victims of armed conflicts of a non-international nature (Protocol II) of June 8, 1977 year, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of December 16, 1966 and other international documents relating to armed conflicts of a non-international nature. The international system of human rights protection is part of the system of international relations as a whole, but on the other hand, it is a system of international law, forming one of its branches. There are three main points of view regarding the place of human rights in international relations. According to the traditional statistical approach, human rights are a matter of sovereign state jurisdiction and continue to be a secondary object of international relations. There is a need to ensure human rights under any circumstances. An important priority in international cooperation is the protection and guarantee of human rights during armed conflicts and conflicts of a non-international nature. To date, international law refers to armed conflicts with condemnation, aggression, and prohibits any kind of war in general.

Rule of law is the value of democratic institution that focuses on the legal justification of every action by the government officials and adjudication of disputes through the independent and competent court. The Constitution has guaranteed the rule of law through its preamble, fundamental rights with constitutional remedy, directive principle and state policies and various other provisions that have added hope for the people of limited government. The Constitution focuses on both horizontal and vertical separation of state power. Horizontal power is divided into three organs of government; legislative, executive and judiciary and vertical power is divided into central, provincial and local level government with the federal character of the nation. The judiciary is empowered to test the constitutionality of legislative and administrative actions which is the essence of rule of law of democratic nations.

ISBN: 978-0822359968addicted.pregnant.poor. by medical anthropologist Kelly Ray Knight is a poignant glimpse into the lives of pregnant addicts living in daily-rent hotels in San Francisco's Mission District. Through interviews and participant observation, Knight collects the stories—past and present—of these women's struggles as they navigate unstable housing, hazardous health conditions, crack addiction (as well as other substance abuse), court hearings and orders, arrests and jail time, public assistance bureaucracy, and the pressures of pregnancy. The book is divided into six chapters, each of which I will discuss below. Ultimately, the book sheds light on the complex space these women occupy in public policy and in the eyes of the society. With thoughtful reflection on the ethics of ethnographic “vulturism,” Knight offers nuanced considerations for the public and policymakers alike. In chapter one, “consumption and insecurity,” Knight begins by explaining the chaotic world of her participants' unstable housing. She details the differences between private daily-rent hotels (where all the women in this study reside) versus public single room-occupancy options, which tend to be cheaper, but often mandate drug abstinence and prohibit sex work. Here, the reader also begins to understand the tenuous relationships these women have with hotel managers, who charge inconsistent fees, are incentivized to accrue renter debt, and frequently kick renters out of their rooms at strategic intervals so they cannot claim residency. Like the rest of the book, Knight presents this relationship in all its complexity, highlighting the managers' own hardships and selective protection of favorite renters. In this chapter, Knight's inclusion of personal photographs is useful in bringing her imagery to life, depicting bugs, filth, environmentally exacerbated medical issues, and nearby billboards admonishing pregnant addicts. Chapter two, “pregnancy and time,” highlights Knight's significant theoretical contribution to how social scientists conceive of the addicted/pregnant/poor: the consideration of multiple temporalities. Unlike a middle-class white woman who might be pregnant in San Francisco, the women in this study operate on several distinct but competing temporal planes. Knight names these as “addict time, hotel time, pregnancy time, jail time, treatment time, epidemiological time, biomedical time, memorial time, and life time.” A decision which may appear completely illogical to social scientists (like the obviously pregnant Ramona denying her pregnancy to others to respond to the demands of “addict time” and “hotel time”) is better understood through the consideration of these multiple temporalities. This elucidation is so useful that I believe it would have served as an even better organizational framework than the current chapter organization. Organizing the book by temporality (e.g., reframing “consumption and insecurity” to “hotel time”) would present the reader with a consistent thread connecting each chapter to this important theoretical contribution. Chapters three (“neurocratic futures and the disability economy”) and four (“street psychiatrics and new configurations of madness”) both highlight the bureaucratic side of public housing, benefits, and treatment options for addicted, pregnant, poor women. In these chapters, Knight makes the impossibly complex world of public assistance accessible to readers from a variety of backgrounds. She explains how to secure assistance for her participants, “neurocrats” must prove these women suffer from disabilities entirely separate from their addictions. Public health providers then have the task of addressing comorbid mental and physical traumas that are realistically impossible to disaggregate as causes or effects of addiction. Relatedly, Knight also highlights that women who give birth or miscarry are prone to losing benefits that are tied to the fetus rather than themselves. In the current US climate, where the legal primacy of fetal personhood over the mother's wellbeing is only growing, these descriptions emphasize to policymakers the importance of supporting addicted women regardless of whether they are pregnant or not. Chapter five, “stratified reproduction and kin of last resort,” emphasizes that certain (wealthy) women are encouraged by policy and society to reproduce, while other (poor) women are not. In this chapter, Knight includes several ads from Project Prevention encouraging addicted, pregnant, poor women to seek birth control or sterilization, which some argue is a form of “soft eugenics.” Here, the discussion of stratified reproduction would benefit from the inclusion of a reproductive justice framework.1 This framework considers the multiple intersections of reproductive oppression faced by women of color in the United States, emphasizing people's rights to have children, to not have children, and to raise them in safe and healthy environments. Knight intentionally avoided moralistic judgments throughout the book (and therefore may have chosen to avoid making rights claims), but a more intersectional approach would have been helpful here. Chapter five does note the forced sterilization of Black women historically in the United States and the fabrication of the “crack baby” myth, but could have also included the many other ways in which Black motherhood has been vilified and discouraged throughout US history and today.2 With this context, differential maternal health outcomes for Black people could be addressed. For example, how did health outcomes of Black participants in this study compare to those of their White and/or Latina counterparts? The final chapter before the conclusion “victim-perpetrators” discusses the dualistic discursive construction of pregnant addicts. Knight describes how they are simultaneously considered victims of their own brain chemistry and traumatic pasts as well as perpetrators of harm against their future children. As such, their interactions with law enforcement and the legal system are anything but straightforward. With striking vulnerability, Knight describes her own conflicting feelings about carceral policies against these women; some leading them to get clean while others cruelly tear them from their babies at birth. It is only appropriate for Knight to end the book with such nuanced policy analysis, complicated by the simultaneous anger and compassion she feels for her pregnant, addicted, poor participants. Overall, addicted.pregnant.poor. is an incredibly complex look into the lives of an oft-overlooked group of women by public policy and society writ large. Among other strengths, the book is a striking demonstration of ethnographic positionality and self-reflection. Knight fearlessly addresses the ethical implications of “complex vulturism” and reveals her own inner turmoil with refreshing vulnerability. Other strengths of the book include the theoretical contribution of considering the multiple temporalities on which pregnant addicts operate, accessible descriptions of public assistance bureaucracy, and the provoking inclusion of (sometimes unsettling) personal photography. Providing a glimpse into the lives of some of the most vulnerable pregnant populations, this book also offers a jumping-off point for policy discussions in an American environment that is increasingly hostile to abortion-seekers. While weaknesses are few, the book chapters could have been framed according to temporality and a deeper consideration of race would be beneficial. All in all, the book is an invaluable addition to the field of medical anthropology and should be taught in any course on ethnographic methods. The author declares no conflict of interest.",en

On this, at least, historians agree. But when it comes to why they are so powerful and how that power should be used, a great deal is up for debate. Some see the archive as the bedrock of empirical work; if not objective, the archive is as close as we can get to a shared source base from which to tell authoritative histories. To others, the archive’s power is wielded by those who assemble and oversee it—sometimes, against those whose names and lives appear within its boxes. Archives are fetishized and feared, at times by the same people; their boundaries can be policed with vigor or rendered porous through critique. But at the end of the day, they are powerful—and that is what keeps people coming back year after year, attempting to draw out their secrets or tear down their walls.

To that end, the author incorporates second language and academic discourse socialization theories with the concept of “desire” in TESOL. Design/methodology/approach In this autoethnographic paper, the author discusses his academic discourse socialization as an international graduate student in the form of an evocative autoethnography of socialization. The author uses data gathered through his personal memory in the form of self-reflections. Using Chang’s “chronicling the past strategy” (2008, p. 72), the author prepared a data chart, which included information regarding the data source, its mode, time, venue and stories gleaned. The author used this data chart as a self-generated document to guide him through the selection process of his personal memories in an organized way while writing mystory. Findings The findings show that his academic discourse socialization was mainly influenced by the attitudes of local US citizens’ and existing members of international communities in both on- and off-campus settings. Over time, his academic discourse socialization turned out to be a complex process where the author oftentimes found himself struggling to find an entry point in extracurricular conversations and interactions. Research limitations/implications The author recommends further research to focus on the inner worlds of both old(er) timers and newcomers to understand the challenges, emotions and nuances that are at play in both L2 socialization and academic discourse socialization of international students. Originality/value In this autoethnographic study, the author offers a unique example of an international PhD student’s transnational socialization experiences. Future international students, higher education administrators, faculty members and local graduate students may learn from his autoethnography and approach their future academic relationships in a more informed way.",en

Design/Approach/Methods The researchers drew upon the theoretical framework of multilingual digital storytelling (MDST), which emphasizes the intercultural awareness attributes of multilingual learners (MLs) and takes a heteroglossic perspective in linguistic pedagogy. This qualitative case study examined the experiences of 11 U.S.-based preservice teachers (PSTs) and 12 MLs elementary students in Korea in the MDST project of a TESOL methods course. Findings The findings showed that PSTs and MLs enhanced their appreciation for educational technology, multilingualism, and intercultural awareness. Although the project aimed to decenter English as a hegemonic language, both PSTs and MLs maintained traditional discourses that privileged English over MLs’ home language and targeted literacy correctness in written English only, moving away from the heterogeneous goals of the course project. PSTs and MLs also faced challenges in navigating technological tools, which negatively affected their perception of the project.

https://openalex.org/W4381995950,2023,Sociology,"Compiled by AILA ReN coordinatorClaire KRAMSCH, the founder of the ReCAL research network, shared with us excerpts from her AILA Lyon 2023 presentation to give us an overview of the network's historical perspective and the developed or ongoing projects. The Research Network ReCAL or Research Cultures in Applied Linguistics was established in 2015 by the AILA Executive Committee. The role was to examine the cultural, political, epistemological, and methodological diversity of applied linguistics research in the various countries, members of AILA; as well as the diversity of institutional conditions in which the research is conducted. Scientific culture. In order to know, how theories from Global North and Global South countries have been received, interpreted, and put into practice in different countries with different intellectual, scientific, and educational traditions. Editorial culture. To determine the opportunities and constraints of publishing in English. In particular, how to publish in English without losing the conceptual, epistemological, and pedagogical specificity of a research often conceived in a language different from English. Pedagogical culture. To find out what are the epistemological and political bases of language teaching in different education systems. At the AILA International Congress in the Netherlands in 2022, the title of the symposium was “The dynamics of language, communication and culture in applied linguistic research in Latin America” and most speakers were English teachers from various Latin American countries.1 Participants sought to respond to changes due to globalization: inequalities and social justice; epistemological and ideological sequels of colonialism; deconstruction and postmodern theories concerning the language–identity–culture relationship; and the didactic foundations of language teaching. One of the central themes of this symposium was the dominant role played by English in research on language learning and teaching and in the development of communicative and intercultural competence. How to teach English and conduct research in applied linguistics without necessarily adopting theories and pedagogies from the Global North? How to publish the results of this research in English without neglecting the national and indigenous languages in which this research was conceived? Much of the discussion centered around the need to consider decolonization research and practices, but … What was meant by decolonization? As organizers of the 2022 ReCAL symposium Claire KRAMSCH (Emerita Professor at Berkeley University), Harold CASTEÑEDA (PhD Professor at Universidad Distritital Francisco José de Caldas), and Paola GAMBOA (PhD Lecturer at Sorbonne Nouvelle University) have decided to coordinate a volume on the decolonization of research in applied linguistics in Latin America. In this volume, researchers from Colombia, Argentina, Brazil, and the United States were invited to report on their work, adopting as much as possible a reflexive stance, and to offer a critical analysis of their efforts to decolonize their research projects. In particular, they would analyze, using Spanish or Portuguese and English, their own locus of enunciation/lugar de enunciación/lugar de fala. The title of the volume is “Decolonization of applied linguistics research in Latin America: Moving to a multilingual mindset” and it will be published in September 2023 by Routledge. It was decided to ask each author to base his report and reflection on the notion of locus of enunciation, a term inspired by the work of researchers like Ramon Grosfoguel (2007)2 from Puerto Rico, Walter Mignolo from Argentina, and Catherine Walsh (2018)3 and Eduardo Diniz de Figueiredo (2021)4 from Brazil. In Latin America, the locus of enunciation adds a social, cultural, and political dimension to the French notion of the situation of enunciation that comes from Benveniste (1966).5 By making explicit, not only the questions of linguistic enunciation (who speaks? to whom? in what context?) but also the place from which we speak, the place from which one exercises real or symbolic power over others, and the place from which one is subjected to the real or symbolic domination of others, we begin to define the contours of a “colonial” power in the acts of enunciation of the speaking subject. Enunciation itself is no longer simply the discursive process by which a speaking subject is placed in particular spatiotemporal circumstances that vary according to the identity of the speaker and the listener. Rather, this situation of enunciation is itself created by the choices made by the interlocutors in exchange situations (face to face, on the telephone, in writing, etc.); and by the way they position themselves in relation to each other, in relation to the language they choose to speak (rather than another language), and the message they seek to communicate. The term colonial here means more than the historical domination of one people by another. It is a relationship of forces between, for example, native speakers and non-native speakers, between English speakers and non-English speakers, between speakers of a dominant national language and speakers of indigenous or other minority languages, between users of binary or non-binary writing, between those who use standard grammar and pronunciation and those who use a non-standard way of speaking. But if this colonial balance of power is reflected in the way people talk, it does not determine how people think. As Ramon Grosfoguel says, the place of enunciation is indeed the geopolitical place where the speaking subject is situated, but it does not necessarily dictate its epistemological positionality. Therefore, the possibility for the three of us to conceive an editorial project concerning a decolonization of scientific knowledge in research, in teaching–learning and didactics of languages, and in applied linguistics. As the title of Eduardo de Figueiredo's article (2021) indicates, making explicit “the place of enunciation is a way of confronting epistemological racist discourse and decolonizing scientific knowledge” by leveling off its universalist aims and historicizing its claims to objectivity. The symposium the RECAL research Network presented at the AILA International Congress in Lyon in 2023 stems from this volume and from the idea of this 20th congress, to move toward more committed applied linguistics. This symposium with the theme “Diversity and inclusion in teacher's development and pedagogic practices in culturally different educational systems” will be coordinated by Claire KRAMSCH and Paola GAMBOA.

https://openalex.org/W4386093708,2023,Sociology,"On the diverse priorities of autonomous womenIn Liberalism, Neutrality, and the Gendered Division of Labor, Gina Schouten argues that political liberalism can support remedies to the gendered division of labor (henceforth GDL). Schouten defends policy proposals designed to incentivize men's uptake of caregiving responsibility in order to move us beyond the stalled revolution in gender equality, wherein gendered norms endorse and support the perpetuation of gendered caregiving norms, continuing today as “specialization-lite.” The book is a rigorously argued work that explicates the core commitments of political liberalism, attempting to deploy these theoretical resources to obtain a state of affairs she calls “gender egalitarianism.” Despite the lucidity of her argument, one that is as close to a valid argument as one can find in political philosophy, Schouten's justification for her preferred changes to the GDL fails due to the content of its claims about autonomy. More specifically, I will argue that: (1) Schouten's argument about autonomy does not appreciate the complexity with which individuals exercise autonomous capacities in oppressive contexts; (2) role modeling for autonomy is not a homogenous phenomenon; and (3) the nature of the obstacle presented by the gendered division of labor will vary for women in different groups and social positions, and it should not be assumed that an obstacle to the autonomy of white women necessarily poses a greater obstacle to the autonomy of women of color. Let us begin with a brief summary of the way Schouten links a neutral idea of mutual acceptability to comprehensive autonomy. Defined contrastively with comprehensive liberalism, political liberalism claims that the justification of state power cannot rely on the endorsement of comprehensive autonomy, for doing so would simply render liberalism another sectarian doctrine. On Schouten's political liberalism, though, a legitimate use of state power can have a principal aim of promoting comprehensive autonomy as long as the reasons for intervention are mutually acceptable (183). What “mutual acceptability” means here is that political liberalism's reciprocity constraint is satisfied if political interventions can be justified on the basis of “citizenship interests.” Because “citizenship interests” is a normative concept, and mutual acceptability does not amount to real persons offering reasons to one another, the content of “citizenship interests” plays an important role in the argument. These citizenship interests include: “a higher-order interest in protecting that capacity [to form, reflect, and revise their philosophical, religious, or moral outlook on life], which includes an interest in preserving the conditions under which they can revise their conception of the good” (184). The conclusion of this line of argument is that “protecting the capacity for revising one's conception of the good requires ensuring the capacity for comprehensively autonomous reflection and action” (184). Consequently, for Schouten, the normative conception of citizenship interests ultimately justifies “subsidies for the actual enactment of lifestyles that celebrate and enact comprehensive autonomy” (184). If a person is immersed in a lifestyle that discourages developing that capacity, then we can have assurance that she can develop that capacity only if role models of comprehensive autonomy are visible to her. (184) Schouten's view is that the visibility of role models exercising comprehensive autonomy will give us assurance that people will develop a capacity to revise their conception of the good, where the person who is aided by those who are exercising comprehensive autonomy is immersed in a lifestyle that discourages that capacity. The immersion condition is a description of a situation. The role modeling claim asserts a connection between a person who satisfies the immersion condition and the presence and visibility of role models of comprehensive autonomy. Although an “assurance” is weaker than a necessary condition, it nonetheless asserts a strong connection, one that is closer to a guarantee than a mere positive correlation. With her claim about a causal relationship between the presence of role models and the development of the capacity for comprehensively autonomous reflection and action, Schouten's argument moves into the sphere of nonideal theory, where the use of idealizations must be defended. The immersion condition seems to rely on a nearly uniform understanding of relationship between individuals and the social context in which they live, and in doing so, it underrates just how dynamic that relationship can be. In fact, the dynamism of individuals' interactions with their social context, even with oppressive social contexts, is evident in the fact that people in a wide variety of situations exercise their capacities for autonomy. When the dominant construction of a social arrangement oppresses groups of individuals, they often find ways to engage in resistance. However, these forms of resistance may not be understood or recognized by the people occupying the dominant discursive positions. Conditions that are sufficiently hostile to a person's autonomy may free the person from attempting to satisfy dominant institutional expectations, and in this way, the individual may become more autonomous. In these cases, although norms have not changed, the individual gains independence of mind from the expectations of others. Evidence of this phenomenon is present in the fact that women and racially oppressed persons can develop oppositional forms of autonomy and resistance even in the milieu of these oppressive norms (Meyers, 2004, Medina, 2013). Schouten's role modeling claim depends on being able to identify enactments of autonomy (206). However, I am skeptical that autonomous lives have this externally discernible form. Instead, ascertaining whether another person's choices are autonomous depends on knowledge of that person, which will be influenced by your relationship with them, where the relationship also further informs what they want to reveal to you about their reasons for action. For the role modeling claim to hold, there must be a positive connection between the person enacting a comprehensively autonomous lifestyle and others around them. Here again, a relational analysis is needed. Who is autonomous—and the relation between that person and the person who is immersed in the context that discourages autonomy—matters. In a society like the U.S., where race is a significant marker for individual identity and self-understanding, race is a significant sorting factor. For instance, a white man growing up as a Catholic man in Connecticut who later rejects religious belief may not serve as a role model for a Latina girl in California who is considering changing her views about religion, even if his story is made visible through media. Similarly, Vice President of the United States Kamala Harris's seemingly high degree of autonomy may have a minimal role-modeling effect on the autonomy of a white Iowan woman. Even more damaging to the tenability of the role modeling claim, though, is that as possibilities for action expand for non-white persons in white dominant societies, some members of the white racial majority view it as an affront to their autonomy. In addition to race, which is a highly salient category in a number of other societies where liberalism is an endemic tradition, other culturally relevant identity markers will impact whether one person constitutes a role model for another one. Moreover, the role modeling relation is made more complicated because the role modeling relationship cannot be reduced to a match in these identity markers. Instead, individuals can also develop a critical understanding of the social norms and narratives in their society and their place in relationship to them.1 Schouten describes the GDL as a “formidable systemic obstacle” (201), which she defines in the following way: “When the social costs of a particular lifestyle are reasonably perceived as excessive in that they reliably deter those who are otherwise strongly inclined to choose that lifestyle, say that the high costs constitute a ‘formidable systemic obstacle’ (FSO) to the lifestyle. When a formidable systemic obstacle obstructs some way of life, say that the way of life is not a genuinely available option” (201). Schouten's argument about formidable systemic obstacles seems to rely on a claim that these obstacles are in fact significant enough to serve as the basis of state intervention, ranking among the most important obstacles.2 However, interventions through public policy should be assessed comparatively, so that the needs that present the greatest injustice, or that present the greatest harm to the most vulnerable, take priority. Let us assume that the prototypical subjects for Schouten's argument are in a white upper-middle-class dual-income heterosexual couple. The members of this couple make choices that are individually rational (see Cudd, 2006), thereby perpetuating a context of gender inequality. But let us look again at the factors that make it individually rational—they are not merely the metrics of income and quality of care for children, but also, the possibility of fitting a social ideal with significant institutional and social payoffs. The allure of exemplifying an ideal will be more seductive, and thus more difficult to escape, for agents who are closer to the ideal than for those who are more distant from it. This is a phenomenon Schouten misses because, despite identifying the problems as arising from middle class heterosexual couples, she contends that they will be an even greater problem for those who deviate even farther from the ideal. On the contrary, the incentives to conform to the norms of “specialization-lite” are more compelling for white individuals in a white-supremacist or white-dominant society because of the possibility that one can attain maximize benefits and minimize burdens in that society within the formal constraints of fairness. If a realistic assessment of options yields that one will not be in this maximized position in the distribution of benefits and burdens, that person may well choose to innovate outside, around, within, or apart from those dominant constructions of society. Consequently, although the GDL may be experienced as the most salient justice-related, formidable, systemic obstacle for white middle-class working mothers in heterosexual marriages, it may well rank lower for non-white women with similar socio-economic markers who regularly navigate racism.3 The same may be true for non-white men. There are certainly many people of color who claim that there are many other problems that constitute greater formidable systemic obstacles to their autonomy than the GDL. Consequently, Schouten's political liberalism has not established that the GDL meets the threshold for state intervention, which should be based on the priorities of real, diverse, people. The possibility of attaining ideal femininity as a mother, or maternal saint, creates greater pressures for white women to comply, where the notion of the ideal family includes gender roles. In contrast, Black women are subjected to racist controlling images as well as to the effects of racism on men in their communities (Collins, 2000, 72). In response to these pressures, Black women have developed the value of ""communalism"", defined as a Black feminist principle of investment and involvement in one's community (Omolade, 1986) to overcome male disinvestment in caregiving such that it does not constitute the same type of obstacle in these communities. It is not at all clear to me that white women should not develop an informal response akin to communalism, using their agentic capacities, rather than requiring state intervention. It should be clear now that it is not always, or even usually, the case that an arrangement that is bad for white women will be worse for minority women. For instance, if we are to achieve racial justice in caregiving arrangements, white families will have more caregiving labor to perform when women of color are no longer readily available to be their caregivers as nannies, mammies, and sidekicks. Therefore, although the GDL may be the remaining significant obstacle to comprehensive autonomy for upper-middle class white women, more arguments are needed to establish that it is the most salient concern for many other women.4 My next disagreement with Schouten further explores the connection between comprehensive autonomy and gender egalitarian lifestyles. Schouten claims that individuals will value the genuinely available option to enact gender egalitarian lifestyles in a just politically liberal society (198). Although her argument does not rely upon a claim that the preference for affordable access to gender egalitarianism is in fact widespread, the plausibility of the claim relies on an equivocation about the meaning of gender egalitarianism. According to Schouten, “In a society that protects the two moral powers of citizenship, we must assume that this preference [for gender egalitarian lifestyles] will be widespread” (206). It might be justified to assume that there will be widespread preferences for a form of gender egalitarianism understood more capaciously as a preference for relations grounded in equal respect, but Schouten defines the term gender egalitarian more narrowly, as a “social ideal whereby any differences in social roles between males and females concerning work are not determined or reinforced by social norms or social institutions that promote gendered allocations of work” (15). The definition of ""gender egalitarian"" Schouten offers articulates a specific goal about social roles and work, and it is too narrow to warrant the general term ""gender egalitarian"", which should be reserved for its general purpose as relations grounded in equal respect, and acknowledged as multiply realizable. In addition, I am not convinced that Schouten's formulation of political liberalism and the gendered division of labor should set the agenda for state intervention. One reason for my uneasiness with this agenda is that the description of Kathleen Gerson's study in LNG is not sufficient to establish that these changes are indeed a priority for women in different contexts. Although Schouten's argument about the problems with the status quo characterizes the most salient justice-related concern for middle-class white women today, I question whether it fully supports the idea that concerns with specialization-lite are indeed a concern for diverse women, even within the narrow age range specified. The liberal definition of gender egalitarianism would benefit from engagement with additional studies exploring how various women of color define their priorities (see e.g., Moorman, 2020). Indeed, for Schouten's conclusions about the relevance of her claims to hold for all women, we need to know more about Gerson's methodology and her data set. Nonetheless, I applaud Schouten for this empirical engagement, which sets the stage for additional engagement between political philosophers and social scientists on these matters. Although my primary disagreement has to do with the justification for these changes and the account of autonomy upon which they rely, I also have a reservation about the “daddy months” policy Schouten prefers, which makes a mother's increased access to parental leave contingent on the father taking up the leave. Diverse priorities among autonomous women must be explored before moving forward with this policy. A “daddy months” policy making a mother's access to childcare leave dependent on the action of her male partner can make her additionally vulnerable to him. It also requires ascertaining the presence of a male partner. Existing U.S. child welfare policies have long engaged in such evaluations, with the tragic result of disproportionately separating black families Roberts, 2022). I urge that specific policy proposals inspired by Schouten's work must take care to avoid the outcome of greater advantages for those who fit a narrow model of the family defined as heteronormative nuclear families. Furthermore, rates and ramifications of domestic violence perpetrated by males must be considered (Gouws, 2016) because in many cases, it may not be desirable to make a female parent's access to additional leave contingent on the male parent's use of it. Finally, in a racist society, where racism coincides with emasculation of minority men, some minority men and women may choose to continue gendered norms as acts of resistance against racism. Therefore, disagreements about priorities and the meanings of certain multiply specifiable values must accommodate the complexity of intersectional social positions, where race and gender are as significant as class inequality in the core theoretical apparatus employed to explicate justice.5 By articulateing a few disagreements with Schouten's claims about autonomy, I have also shown that the autonomy debate between comprehensive and political liberalisms is ripe for a reconceptualization, one that explores the relational aspects of autonomy cultivation, as well as the fact that people who are disadvantaged by institutions and norms often have strong autonomy capacities.6 Whereas political liberals have employed religious disagreement as a kind of ideal case for disagreement, liberalisms that aim to respect diversity while accounting for the pressing injustices of our time should move beyond that focus to endorse a form of autonomy that does not specify which acts and lifestyles count as autonomous. As liberals, we should revisit our family disputes about autonomy in ways that begin from today's significant debates about the content of feminist agendas, racial privilege, and a normative understanding of entitlements to receive care. Moreover, many of the most animated sources of disagreement in western liberal societies involve negotiations about who can feel at home in public and private spaces (Bhandary, 2020, 180), where these disagreements are not limited to matters of religious freedom. Liberalisms that take up this charge to revisit the role and conception of autonomy may better satisfy the neutrality toward which political liberalism strives by offering procedural specifications without dictating the content of the decisions a person can make autonomously.7 Embedding the possibility that people in a just society will value a variety of different lifestyles, these kinds of autonomy incorporate openness to diverse priorities among women. Consequently, they are therefore better equipped to respectfully manage the normative disagreement that occurs among feminists and within different racial groups. Schouten's rigorous application of political liberalism to the GDL clarifies the limitations of political liberalism. In this regard, and many others, her theory is a vital contribution to debates about the form and content of a contemporary liberalism, one that can guide us in comprehending and addressing the pressing injustices of our time. Due to the clarity of her arguments, which lay bare political liberalism's commitments and its limits, we can now better argue about the proper ways to conceptualize autonomy in liberalism in ways that identify when the concept itself inadvertently privileges a subgroup's interests. In doing so, we can move the doctrine of philosophical liberalism toward more meaningful forms respect for the autonomy of persons, within the theoretical apparatus itself. Thus, Schouten's Liberalism, Neutrality, and the Gendered Division of Labor is an important advance in 21st century philosophical liberalism.",en

https://openalex.org/W4382918134,2023,Sociology,"Does distance deter male fertility preservation?“Fertility preservation is about preserving your future options so that you aren’t taking options away from your future self. In this complicated context, living a long distance from the fertility preservation clinic can become yet another barrier, and clinicians can help patients by strategizing with them about ways to overcome such logistical challenges.”—Timothy D. Gilligan, MD For patients with cancer under-going gonadotoxic therapies who wish to undergo sperm banking, distance may have an impact on their decision for making the trek from their homes to the clinic according to a new retrospective study. Overall, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) found that distance seemed to play a role in whether or not men underwent fertility preservation (FP). The study appears in JCO Oncology Practice (doi:10.1200/OP.22.00789). The study authors note that although nearly 90% of the US population lives within a half-hour’s drive to a urologist, there is a steep dropoff for males who live close to specialists and medical centers offering FP. Lead author Daniel Pelzman, MD, resident physician at UPMC’s Department of Urology in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, says that this was a key reason prompting the study. “There has been so little research done about geography as a potential barrier to fertility preservation in men. We believe this is the first study to investigate whether the distances from fertility centers decreased the odds of males taking advantage of FP after referral.” For the study, the researchers investigated male patients who were referred to the UPMC fertility clinic for FP between 2013 and 2021. Each subject had at least reached puberty, and all had FP recommended by a reproductive specialist. Semen was collected at a time chosen by the patients. Although not all patients saw a reproductive urologist before FP, all of them agreed to counseling with an FP coordinator by phone or in person. Specifically, the study reported that for all cancer types, 73.6% (182) of the patients who lived no more than 20 miles away from the UPMC fertility clinic underwent FP. Although a slightly higher proportion of those living 20–40 miles away (70 men) underwent FP (76.1%), rates consistently dropped the farther out people lived from the UPMC fertility clinic; only 59.6% (28 of 47) of the patients who lived 40–60 miles from the clinic and 58.3% (14 of 24) of the patients who lived 80–100 miles from the clinic underwent sperm banking at the UPMC fertility clinic. Still, the researchers noted that the proportion of patients undergoing FP was consistently high (i.e., >50%). “This finding confirms that men want to pursue fertility preservation after referral, even if it is difficult logistically,” Dr Pelzman concluded. Individuals were willing to proceed with sperm banking regardless of the travel distance required. Although the number of patients who underwent sperm banking slightly increased for those who lived 20–40 miles away from the clinic, there appeared to be an overall downward trend in utilization associated with living farther away. Timothy D. Gilligan, MD, vice-chair for education and associate professor of medicine at the Cleveland Clinic’s Taussig Cancer Institute in Cleveland, Ohio, agrees that men would be more likely to complete sperm banking if there were a facility for doing so closer to where they live. “The study was not able to determine whether the men who lived farther away simply went somewhere else closer to do sperm banking, however,” he adds. “In other words, it’s possible that the men who did not complete sperm banking in Pittsburgh did complete it somewhere else.” Dr Gilligan says that a more robust study design would have entailed contacting the subjects of the study to determine whether they had completed sperm banking at a different facility. He adds that one limitation of the study is the denominator: The researchers looked at men who were referred, but it is not known how many men should have been referred but were not. The ultimate question is what percent of men who are appropriate candidates for sperm banking and who want to have their fertility preserved end up being referred for sperm banking and then complete sperm banking,” says Dr Gilligan. “There can be failures to offer fertility preservation, to make fertility preservation feasible, and by the patient to follow through with sperm banking even if it is feasible. If our goal is for men who desire to preserve their fertility to be able to do so, then we need to look at all of the different points in the process where things may break down.” Dr Gilligan also laments that access to care in the United States varies by region. “Rural areas are famously underserved,” he says. “There is not only the cost of running such a clinic but also the problem of liability in case the specimen is mishandled or not properly stored.” If sperm banking were offered more widely, he believes more men would preserve their sperm. One solution proposed by the study authors is mail-in semen cryopreservation services. Although the authors believe that this could emerge as a viable option, at this time there are minimal data on how reliable or accurate this option is. Dr Gilligan agrees. “As the study mentions, mail-in semen cryopreservation kits may be a much more economically feasible solution than trying to set up a fertility preservation clinic in every town.” A key takeaway for Dr Gilligan is that clinicians must not only remember to offer cryopreservation to appropriate patients and to make referrals for those who want to do so but also need to talk with them about barriers to completing FP, including economic, cultural, logistical, and emotional issues. “A diagnosis of cancer is often terrifying and disorienting, and patients are often so worried about surviving their cancer that fertility does not seem like a priority, even if it will be a priority in the future,” he says. “One thing we can do is to validate the importance that many people put on fertility and to help them recognize that even if they aren’t worried about fertility in the aftermath of their cancer diagnosis, they may well feel differently in the future when their treatment has been completed. “Fertility preservation is about preserving your future options so that you aren’t taking options away from your future self,” he continues. “In this complicated context, living a long distance from the fertility preservation clinic can become yet another barrier, and clinicians can help patients by strategizing with them about ways to overcome such logistical challenges.” Dr Pelzman believes that the takeaway messages from the study are twofold. “First, hospital systems and providers should increase their efforts to ensure access to fertility preservation even for men living far from fertility centers. More importantly, however, distance should not preclude referral to a reproductive specialist, as a high percentage of men from all distances will pursue fertility preservation if referred.”",en

https://openalex.org/W4384345886,2023,Sociology,"Transcending Mormonism: Transgender Experiences in the LDS ChurchIn 1980, LDS authorities used the term “transsexual” for the first time publicly when they prohibited “transsexual operations” in their official General Handbook of Instructions. They made clear that “members who have undergone transsexual operations must be excommunicated” and that “after excommunication such a person is not eligible for baptism.”1 Such harsh policies were rooted in a broader ambience of strict boundary enforcement of a male–female gender binary and patriarchal hierarchy. This gender-based power structure relied (and still relies) on biologically and theologically essential claims of sexual difference while paradoxically asserting the perpetual malleability and fluidity of gender performance and behavior.2 In other words, LDS leaders have simultaneously framed gender as biologically immutable and a contingent product of culture, practice, and environment.3 However, because the LDS Church among broader conservative movements was focused on the more culturally and politically salient issue of homosexuality, their mentions of trans issues remained scarce for many decades.In the 2020 General Handbook, LDS authorities added more detail than ever before regarding trans issues.4 Some additions seemed to show increased compassion and inclusion for trans individuals, while others doubled down on long-standing discriminatory policies that punish transitional surgeries.5 In addition, they made clear that “social transitioning” would be grounds for membership restrictions6 (i.e., Church discipline), a new policy that has raised questions about how boundaries of gender nonconformity will be policed in the Church. To make legible an identity (or identities) that currently has little to no semantic or symbolic space in LDS theology, many trans Mormons conscientiously negotiate the relationship between their religious and gender identities, a process that often involves conflict, pain, and despair.7Desiring to better understand how people are navigating these complex identity negotiations, I interviewed seven trans and/or gender nonconforming Mormons between eighteen and forty-four years old living in various regions of the United States as part of my graduate studies at Sarah Lawrence College in New York. All participants identified as white, politically liberal, and were either current or former college students.8 They will be referred to with pseudonyms to protect their anonymity. Six of the seven interviews were one-time hour-long conversations via Zoom, and one interview with an individual I will refer to as Juliana (age forty-four) was a written exchange that consisted of several emails. Analyses from the interviews are intermingled throughout with the purpose of highlighting some of the nuances, complexities, and differences that exist across trans Mormon experiences.In order to present sufficient contextual background, I will first provide a brief history of gender and homosexuality in the post–World War II LDS Church. Next, I will discuss in depth the specific ways in which interviewees were negotiating and making meaning of their trans and Mormon identities in the context of broader trans experiences. I will then describe important evolution on Church policies affecting trans individuals and propose institutional and theological suggestions for creating a more inclusive and affirming space for all sexual and gender identities within the Church. Ultimately, the beauty and diversity of trans Mormon experiences calls for a restructuring of current cissexist and heterosexist Church policies and a reimagining of LDS theology such that moral character and eternal glory are not dependent on one's gender identity and romantic relationships.Before delving into the specific experiences of those I interviewed, I will provide an overview of the ways in which LDS elites have constructed sexual and gender classification schemes that perpetually position non-heteronormative individuals as deficient, oppositional, and/or sinful, a sociological phenomenon referred to by Michael Schwalbe as “oppressive othering.”9 As gay and lesbian sexual liberation movements gained increased social and political momentum in the late 1950s and 60s, LDS authorities began harshly and publicly condemning homosexuality (and then later transgender experiences) on the grounds that it confuses gender roles and fundamentally defies God's universal plan.10Because experiences around what we now call “transgender” identity did not have linguistic space until the latter part of the twentieth century, the first mentions of sexual and gender minorities by LDS authorities focused on people they referred to as “homosexuals.” In fact, the first time the words “homosexual” and “homosexuality” appeared in a public speech from an LDS authority was in 1952.11 Throughout the first half of the twentieth century, Church leaders had begun punishing alleged “sodomites,” excommunicating members found guilty of “the crime against nature.” They even organized “witch hunts,” where Church officials hunted down and interrogated allegedly homosexual men, enacting harsh disciplinary action upon guilty individuals.12Rhetoric from Church elites around homosexuality became increasingly harsh and public during the 1950s and 60s.13 Spencer W. Kimball, a prominent mid-twentieth century figure in Mormon leadership, after discovering that several Christian groups had started reaching out in compassion to homosexuals, stated: “Voices must cry out against them. Ours cannot remain silent. To the great Moses, these perversions were an abomination and a defilement worthy of death. To Paul, it was unnatural, unmanly, ungodly, and a dishonorable passion of an adulterous nature and would close all doors to the kingdom.”14 His stern condemnations were part of a top-down campaign in which LDS leaders framed homosexuality as a viral contagion and serious threat to individual, familial, and societal well-being, one that required urgent treatment and forceful eradication.15 In line with white, middle-class notions of respectability, Mormon leaders frequently positioned homosexuality as part of the decaying moral fabric of American society and antithetical to happy, successful family life. In doing so, they leveraged a host of “homosexuality causes” that often had to do with poor parenting, sexual abuse, masturbation, pornography, and a confusion of gender roles, among other things.16Exposure to pornography was an especially prevalent explanation. For example, LDS authority Victor Brown once said to a worldwide church audience: “A normal twelve- or thirteen-year-old boy or girl exposed to pornographic literature could develop into a homosexual. You can take healthy boys or girls and by exposing them to abnormalities virtually crystallize and settle their habits.”17 Echoing traditional Christian fears concerning pornography, as well as middle-class fears about sexual knowledge and experimentation,18 LDS elites argued that moral transgressions like pornography could literally cause homosexuality. These oppressive frameworks, grounded in psychodynamic theories of sexual malleability and fluidity, paved the way for the widespread practice of aversion therapy and reparative therapy (reparative therapy is sometimes referred to as conversion therapy).The general assumption of Church leaders at the time was that sexual malleability explained “how someone could . . . become homosexual to begin with” and offered “a plan for that person to embrace heterosexuality.”19 Aversion therapy, most notably practiced at Brigham Young University at least until the late 1970s, may have consisted of electroshock therapy programs, nausea-inducing chemical treatments, and a host of other dehumanizing methods in an attempt to change the sexual orientation of homosexual people.20 Reparative therapy and other less aggressive forms of sexual orientation change efforts have persisted for many more decades and are even still practiced today.21 Under the guise of healing and helping homosexual individuals “overcome their disease”22 through a variety of treatment methods, the LDS Church justified decades of inhumane and sometimes torturous methods in an attempt to obliterate homosexuality from the Church and American society as a whole.Central to LDS theology is the idea that gender is an essential and divine characteristic assigned by God in the premortal life. In a semi-canonical 1995 document called “The Family: A Proclamation to the World,” top LDS leaders declare that “gender is an essential characteristic of individual premortal, mortal, and eternal identity and purpose.”23 They also explicitly outline what they believe to be God-given male and female roles: “By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families. Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children.”24 Within this patriarchal framework, LDS leaders have grounded female domestic labor and male economic opportunity in appeals to a “divine order.”This institutional structure is an example of what Raewyn Connell refers to as a “gender regime,” or a particular configuration of power relations based on gendered divisions. She further explains that the construction and maintenance of patriarchal regimes often utilizes “strategic essentialism,” or explanations of origin regarding supposedly innate sexual differences.25 She concludes that “most origin stories are not history but mythmaking, which serves to justify some political view in the present.”26Although modern LDS leaders on the surface have presented gender as an immutable characteristic that begins in premortal existence, they have also devoted tremendous effort and resources to regulating male and female gender roles through political, legal, and cultural norms.27 On the one hand, they have claimed that male and female sexual differences are natural and self-evident, but on the other hand, they have provided tireless cautions regarding the perpetual malleability and contingency of gender performance.28 In other words, if not policed through institutional and cultural norms, gender identity and performativity is always at risk of failure, confusion, or alteration—a phenomenon that has at times been implicated as a cause (and a result) of homosexuality.29Notwithstanding such contradictions, LDS gender schemes have long supported patriarchal frameworks that domesticate and subordinate women while empowering and enriching men.30 More egalitarian notions of marriage have entered into LDS teachings in recent decades, something Taylor Petrey refers to as “soft egalitarianism,” because men still “preside” over the home and the Church.31 And since there is such a strong emphasis on conformity and obedience in the LDS Church, many male and female members who internalize these notions of sexual difference and mid-twentieth-century gendered divisions of labor tend to feel close to God and fortified in their faith.32Along with the emergence of rhetoric targeting homosexuality in the 1950s, Church leaders began describing gender as completely interchangeable with biological sex. LDS authorities (perhaps until very recently33) have collapsed gender and biological sex into one concept, an ideology that defies well-accepted feminist and anthropological arguments that have distinguished biological sex (meaning male and female bodies) from socially constructed “gender” (meaning social roles and norms that vary dramatically across culture and time).34 As a result, LDS leaders tend to view gender (including gender identity, expression, and roles) as an immutable and natural outgrowth of biological sex. Similarly, heterosexual attraction/desire is assumed to be a predetermined, innate characteristic of one's gender or biological sex.35 Within this scheme of biological essentialism, one that indistinguishably entangles gender and sex, Church leaders have conceptualized homosexuality as a direct result (and a cause) of gender confusion, or a concept nineteenth-century psychologists referred to as “gender inversion.” Spencer W. Kimball put it this way: Every form of homosexuality is sin . . . Some people are ignorant or vicious and apparently attempting to destroy the concept of masculinity and femininity. More and more girls dress, groom, and act like men. More and more men dress, groom, and act like women. The high purposes of life are damaged and destroyed by the growing unisex theory. God made man in his own image, male and female made he them. With relatively few accidents of nature, we are born male or female. The Lord knew best. Certainly, men and women who would change their sex status will answer to their Maker.36These arguments, which persist in the Church today, rely upon stereotypical depictions of atypically gendered homosexuality and reinforce cultural notions conflating sex, gender, and sexualities.37 They also rely on assumptions that homosexuality both leads to and results from an “attack” on gender roles, and this rhetoric is part of a broader effort to enforce gender norms and punish gender deviance. Interestingly, Kimball's language equates homosexual experiences with what we would now call transgender experiences when he refers to homosexuals as people who “change their sex status.” As a result, trans and gay experiences have often been rendered in LDS teachings as “the same” because they both involve a rejection of “divine gender norms.”38 Not only does this ignore the multitude of gender identities that span gay/lesbian experiences, and the fact that many trans people do not identify as gay/lesbian, it also serves a broader goal of reducing and making illegible sexual minority experiences in LDS contexts.Throughout my interviews, I quickly noticed that individuals construct what it means to be “trans” very differently. For trans people more broadly, ideas about gender identity, gender expression, coming out (and being out), and the concept of gender itself vary dramatically and sometimes contradict one another.39 As I portray the personal ways in which interviewees negotiate (and renegotiate) their religious and gender identities, I will simultaneously emphasize the vast diversity contained in the space we call “trans Mormon.”The tinted phone booth analogy was one of the first descriptions Juliana provided about what her life was like as a “female spirit” trapped inside of a male body. This analogy seemed to capture her experiences so powerfully. She does not consider herself “out” and goes by “Julian” at work, at home, at church, and with her friends. She can count on one hand the people in her life who know about her internal sense of femaleness. Like many other trans Mormons, Juliana must navigate a series of complex, sensitive, and often painful decisions around who she is and who she wishes to be.Out of the individuals I interviewed, Juliana's description of being a woman trapped in a male body is perhaps the most familiar and conventional when discussing trans experiences. It is important to note that she was the only middle-aged individual (age forty-four) with whom I spoke, as all others were between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five. While a significant percentage of people from younger generations do in fact experience their transness in the context of the male–female gender binary, when compared to older generations, it is more common for millennial and Gen Z trans individuals to construct gender identities that subvert or exist outside of the gender binary. Similarly, those of younger generations statistically have an easier time being out about their trans identity, while those of older generations like Juliana are more likely to remain stealth (i.e., hidden) about their trans identity.41 These generational differences are understandable considering the substantively different cultural and political climates of current and past generations regarding acceptance of non-cisgender identities.The individuals I spoke with revealed intricate and thoughtful ways in which they were constructing a sense of what it means to be trans and Mormon, and particularly, how they felt about gender itself as a concept. Several conceptualized their trans identity as existing within the male–female gender binary, while others described their gender identity as existing outside of or in between the gender binary. For instance, in explaining her fervent wish to allow her female spirit to be free, Juliana said: While my name is Julian, my heart wishes so acutely it were Juliana. I try hard to attend and participate in elders quorum [church group designated for men]. My heart wishes, however, that I could be in Relief Society [church group designated for women]. I try to bear numbing internal frustration, in part from a feeling like I need to wear a white, button-up shirt and necktie, by wearing mainly ties that have some pink in them; though my heart yearns to be wearing, instead, a cute dress and a necklace. But it's so much more than clothes. It's also sisterly connection.42As demonstrated by this moving excerpt, a sense of being trans for Juliana is inextricably linked to the male–female gender binary. Her sense of self is not only built on the feeling of “being female” but also on deeply yearning to “do female things,” such as attending Relief Society meetings, having pink in her ties, and wearing “a cute dress and necklace.” However, she explains that it is more than simply outward expression and clothing choice. She longs for a “sisterly connection” that would come from surrounding herself with other women.Sarah (age twenty-three) was assigned male at birth and also experiences her trans identity within the gender binary. She underwent a gender confirmation surgery, transitioning to a woman in 2019. Interestingly, when asked about the concept of gender, she affirmed the LDS Church's conservative stance that God created two eternal genders—male and female. Thus, she simply believes that God gave her the wrong body: “While I don't have all the answers about gender, I at least know that God created male and female in his image. As for me and my situation, I don't exactly know what happened, although I do believe that God made me female and for some reason put me in a male body.”43 Sarah's belief that God mistakenly clothed her female spirit in a male body does not disrupt the firmness of her convictions in Mormon theology—in fact, it harmoniously fits within her beliefs about the eternal and essential nature of gender.Kevin (age twenty-two) identities as a member of the trans community and more specifically as bigender. They described the complexity of their gender identity in this way: As I got older, I would talk to women, and I wished I was them. And in my sexual fantasies, I found myself, like, desiring to be a woman sometimes. And so recently, I've realized, like, that there's some aspects of being male that I feel I identify with and desire. And then there's also some aspects of being female that I empathize with and desire. I know a lot of trans people who kind of feel sort of in the middle where they just don't really feel like they fit in with either. I've heard people describe themselves as, like, genderless blobs, and things like that. But that's never how I've felt. I've felt more like both genders and like strong pulls to either, instead of, like, being pushed towards the middle. So that's kind of why I've stuck with the bigender label, because it seems to fit that the best.44Unlike Juliana, Kevin feels pulled toward both male and female genders, and their desire to be masculine and/or feminine varies across context and space. In this way, the term “bigender” provides clarity for their experiences and stands in contrast to what Kevin calls a “genderless blob.”Emily (age twenty-two) describes their gender identity as existing outside of, or perhaps in between, male and female concepts. They explained: The more that I kind of read about different connections to, like, gender and gender identity, I just kind of realized that I don't strongly identify or, like, feel really tied to being a girl or boy. Like, sometimes I used to have my hair all pulled up. I used to pull it up a lot, just like in a hat and hide it. And I would get, like, mistaken for a boy. And that, like, didn't bug me. But it didn't particularly make me feel, like, super awesome either. It was just like, okay, like, it just didn't matter. And so I've been having a lot more friends that are trans or nonbinary. And I kind of was just like, “Oh, I mean, yeah, that's how I feel. I didn't know that.” So, I'm still trying to put words to it. And it's weird because it doesn't feel like I necessarily need to change how I look or how people refer to me. Um, but inside myself, I feel like I identify as nonbinary, like, not as strictly a boy or girl.45Emily describes more of a neutrality or even apathy about their gender expression. Being “mistaken for a boy” was neither good nor bad for their self-image. In fact, they further explained that they “don't feel much of a need to label” themselves at all.Beth (age eighteen) believes that God is not limited by a gender binary and encompasses a broad spectrum of gender identities.Many trans Mormons like Beth validate their gender identity with appeals to a benevolent God who “doesn't make mistakes.”47 As someone whose gender identity falls outside of the traditional binary, Beth articulately affirms that God is the author and creator of all types of gender identities and experiences. Embedded in this position is a view that God's concept of gender (or lack thereof) has been tainted by sociohistorical and political constructions that have been organized into limiting male–female gender schemas.48 Thus, some trans Mormons subvert altogether the Church's teachings regarding gender, while others explain their experiences within an “eternal gender” framework.49 This reflects broader attitudes within United States trans communities, where there are some who advocate for an abolition of gender altogether, and yet others who call for an assimilation of nonconforming gender identities into previously existing gender structures.50 As with Beth and Kevin, many individuals who resist or avoid the male–female binary still use the umbrella term “trans” to describe their identity while also using terms like genderqueer, gender nonbinary, bigender, gender-free, and/or agender to provide added or more specific meaning.51 However, some gender-variant individuals prefer not to use the term “trans” at all, a phenomenon that further complexifies the usage of these terms and the symbolic and semantic spaces they occupy (or do not occupy).Several individuals were in committed romantic relationships at the time of interview, including Sarah, who described the difficulty of articulating her sexual identity several times during our exchange. At one point, she explained that her relationship to her trans boyfriend puts her in an ambiguous space when it comes to sexual identity: “To be honest, I am not really sure about what my sexual identity is. Most of the time, I just identify as straight because I'm dating a trans guy, but I sometimes ask myself, am I pan? Or maybe bi?”52 While Sarah's curiosity and uncertainty regarding her sexual identity was notable, she did not appear concerned about her difficulty describing it.Like Sarah, Theresa (age twenty-five), who identities as nonbinary, also finds themselves in a space of ambiguity when it comes to sexual identity. They explained: “And then there have been brief phases where I was like, do I like guys? Do I not like guys? Am I just a lesbian who's confused? And especially in a society like ours—and I don't mean just LDS culture, I mean just heteronormative culture in general—it can be very confusing to be sure of what your identity is.”53 Acknowledging the difficulty of defining their sexual identity, Theresa points out heteronormative cultural pressures that influence the process of identity development and the labels they decide to adopt. It is particularly interesting that they wonder if they are a “lesbian who's confused,” a common cultural and theological notion that has framed transgender experiences as a hyperextension, an extremized version, or “the final result” of homosexuality.54 Indeed, both Sarah's and Theresa's difficulties in expressing their sexual identities reveal the complex conceptual interplay between gender and sexuality. Their descriptions demonstrate that experiences of sexual desire and identity are dependent upon an ongoing appraisal of one's own and one's partner's gender identity, a phenomenon that reveals the overlapping fluidity and contingency embedded in such categories.55The individuals I interviewed characterized the concepts of coming out and being out with complexity and variation. For Juliana, who is not public about her trans identity, coming out has been a deeply private process involving careful decisions about when, and with whom, to disclose identity. To bring in again her tinted phone booth analogy, she yearns to remove the tint on the windows or restructure the windows altogether, although she feels she has no choice but to remain “trapped” inside. She explained: “I am nervous to share this secret. What would I do if people no longer accepted me in my current job, or if my children got hurt or shamed? These things worry me terribly. I'm not ready to share this with everyone yet, though sometimes I think many might already know or maybe have put two and two together.”56 Juliana feels that her familial, social, and professional life would crumble if her gender identity were made public. Interestingly, she presents herself in normatively masculine ways (i.e., wears men's clothes, uses typical masculine mannerisms), but she still fears that others may be suspicious about her “secret.” I imagine that this hypersensitivity is common among trans Mormons who are not out, an indication of the immense fear and anxiety people like Juliana experience at the thought of others finding out about their identity.For others, a physical and/or social transition is in and of itself a type of coming-out, or as many trans individuals put it, “being out.”57 When several individuals I interviewed explained the concept of “being out,” they emphasized that they are not necessarily out by choice. Their altered physical appearances, either because of surgery, hormonal treatment, and/or gender expression, create a constant state of “outness,” one in which their personal decisions around when and with whom to disclose their gender identity become less relevant. Beth described her sense of being out in this way: I was just out running errands for somebody one time, and I was standing at a tech store, and my back was facing the door and somebody came in. And one of the sales associates was like, “Oh, I'll be right with you.” And the guy was like, “Oh no worries, he was there first.” And I was like, whoa. I couldn't stop smiling. I was like, I can't believe that I was perceived as slightly androgynous. So, I don't experience gender dysphoria, as much as I do experience gender euphoria, you know, able to present and be perceived as, you know, androgynous, even though nonbinary and androgynous aren't necessarily equal, but you know, it just makes me feel very happy.58Even though Beth identifies as nonbinary, they frequently explained a desire to be “perceived as androgynous.” This experience of being read as a “he” in the store shows that Beth's sense of being out is less about verbalizing or declaring their gender identity and more about being perceived in certain ways by others. They describe a feeling of “gender euphoria” as opposed to dysphoria when others are able to correctly perceive their expression of gender in a particular context.For some, identifying as trans is a crucial and all-encompassing part of their sense of self, while for others, it takes up a small or nonexistent identity space.59 Several of the trans Mormons I spoke with reflected this broader phenomenon, as they articulated the salience of their transness (or lack of transness) in significantly different and complex ways. To provide a few examples, Emily, who identifies as nonbinary, explained their gender identity in this way: About a year ago is when I kind of started to question my gender. And it's kind of weird, because, like, I feel comfortable kind of presenting pretty feminine sometimes, like I have my nails done and, like, long hair and I still go by Emily. But sometimes, I feel comfortable presenting more masculine, like with my hair rolled up. Sometimes people will, like, automatically think that I am trans because I prefer to use they/them pronouns and present in, like, ambiguous ways, but I don't think of myself as trans because I don't really have a desire to transition to any specific gender identity.60For Emily, a nonbinary identity is not connected to a trans label. They do not consider themselves to be trans because they lack the desire to “transition” to a specific gender identity, a notion that links trans identity to the traditional gender binary.Kevin, on the other hand, uses the term “trans” as a way to explain their bigender identity: I'm still kind of figuring out my gender. But the one [term] that has stuck with me the most right now is bigender. It's a label that's under the trans umbrella. And I definitely feel comfortable in the trans community. But yeah, I, like, found that a lot of the people I was closest to and had the most similar case to in my online friends community were often trans. And I found that a lot of the music I liked was the same frequently as people who are trans and I felt connected to the emotions and identity of the music and the themes it was exploring.61Although Kevin describes their identity in tentative terms,",en

ISBN: 978‐1‐5381‐6829‐5This book is based on a remarkable Harvard undergraduate honors thesis completed by Patrick Schmidt in 1978, now revisited and moderately updated following a long career in international law. Harvard's Department of Social Relations was formalized in 1946 in a merger of forces from sociology, social anthropology, and social and clinical psychology in an intended interdisciplinary collaboration. After auspicious beginnings, “Soc Rel” lost coherence in the late 1960s and officially disappeared in 1974. In the immediately following years, Schmidt interviewed many of the Department's surviving faculty members while accessing the archived papers of its major protagonists and antagonists, vividly documenting the actual conditions under which the founding partners in Social Relations fought to survive and thrive within the particular Harvard hothouse atmosphere of traditions, ambitions, and pretensions. Early chapters detail how in the late 1930s, a small group of dissident “Levellers” from three established departments collaborated in correspondence and conference with Dean Paul Buck, in creating a proposal to come together in a new combined department devoted to the collective social sciences. Psychology was primarily represented by Gordon Allport, a lone “sociotrope” in a department dominated by “biotropes,” and in alliance with the Harvard Psychological Clinic's Henry Murray, who had been independently appointed by the administration and charged with research and teaching in “abnormal and dynamic” psychology. Sociology, originally regarded as a minor subbranch of Economics and Social Ethics, had only been formally established as a small separate department in 1931 under the conservative and historically oriented Pitrim Sorokin as Chair. Sorokin came under strong challenge by the younger and ambitious Talcott Parsons, an early proponent of Durkheim and Weber who was also developing a strong interest in the implications of psychoanalysis for social theory. In Anthropology, described by Schmidt as a “Department steeped in archeology” (p. 5), a young and psychoanalytically trained Clyde Kluckhohn felt increasingly isolated as he conducted fieldwork-based studies of Navajo culture. Schmidt summarizes that the involved departments were in turmoil as “young professors intensely interested in new theories and methods chafed under the old guard… who regarded their interests as unscientific, frivolous, or even dangerous” (p. 28). But despite support from Dean Buck and Lawrence Henderson, the influential and polymathic embryologist and systems analyst who had mentored both Murray and Parsons, their original proposal for a new department failed to gain higher administration approval. The intradepartmental conflicts remained simmering beneath the surface for the next several years. In a chapter titled “World War II Changes Everything,” Schmidt describes how the exigencies of war research stimulated numerous interdisciplinary collaborations, often outside the university, among anthropologists, sociologists, psychiatrists, and social and clinical psychologists. They joined forces in “what some jokingly referred to as the ‘chairborne’ research unit of the U.S. military” (p. 44). These examples of real interdisciplinary accomplishment boosted the Levellers' old arguments at war's end, while their departmental hostilities resumed and intensified. Psychology's biotropes openly insulted the sociotropes as “intellectually empty do-gooders,” Parsons' disagreement with Sorokin became increasingly personal and hostile, and Kluckhohn's isolation in Anthropology increased intolerably. Now in 1946, the time was finally right for the formal creation of the new Department, dubbed “Social Relations” in a last-minute decision. Primary members from psychology were Allport and his brilliant former student Jerome Bruner, along with Murray with his former Clinic lieutenant Robert White who was named Director of the new department's clinical psychology program. Parsons was joined in sociology by the younger George Homans, and social anthropology was headed by Kluckhohn, who had formed a strong alliance with Murray in promoting a “culture and personality” subdiscipline. For a decade and a half, the new department was a great overt success, with a large and internationally recognized faculty teaching popular undergraduate courses and turning out an impressive list of graduates in all of the disciplines. An incipient weakness, however, was presciently noted by early sociology student Norman Birnbaum, who sensed that a genuinely unified social science “simply was not possible” because “prima donna” faculty members remained essentially isolated within their own specialized lines of inquiry (quoted on p. 84). Talcott Parsons' “general theory of action,” for example, which was intended to be a kind of theoretical “glue” that would interconnect all of the social sciences, turned out to have little and often strongly negative appeal in the disciplines outside of sociology. In a more temperate judgment than Birnbaum's, Schmidt suggests that the new department's all-star faculty and their students simply became “vulnerable to the realities of an academic world stubbornly structured around traditional disciplines” (p. 166). Therefore, instead of becoming genuinely interdisciplinary as originally promised, the department became multidisciplinary with many eminent figures contributing impressively but within their own separate silos. Ironically, the most significant truly interdisciplinary development to emerge from Social Relations was Jerome Bruner's collaboration with George Miller from the old Psychology Department. In 1960, they established the Harvard Center for Cognitive Studies, a crucial event in the emerging “cognitive revolution” after which “cognitive” would become a partner in any number of genuinely interdisciplinary pairings. As one of the final Clinical Psychology PhDs to emerge from Social Relations in 1967, I approached this book with personal as well as historical interest, and concur with its general conclusions. My exposure to the other disciplines was interesting and positive in a “general education” sort of way, but my research and that of most of my colleagues were only minimally influenced by it. Parsons' dense lectures and readings were particularly challenging for many of us psychologists; we faced exam questions on them with dread and got by only thanks to a simplified crib sheet kindly provided by one of his students. Within psychology, however, the atmosphere was intellectually vibrant, and I was extraordinarily fortunate to have caught Gordon Allport and Robert White just before their retirements, and also to have been taught by inspiring younger faculty such as Roger Brown, Jerome Bruner, Irving Gottesman, Brendan Maher, and Robert Rosenthal. Accordingly, I have a quibble with the use of the word “quixotic” in this book's title, because that term's dictionary definition is “foolishly impractical, especially marked by rash lofty ideals.” Schmidt himself seems to disagree with this definition when he concludes that despite its failure to create a new social science, “Social Relations drew distinguished faculty and produced accomplished graduates [whose] work, while not overwhelmingly interdisciplinary, was nonetheless among the most important created anywhere and continues to stand as a significant legacy.” (p. 171). His final sentence asserts that “fitting epitaphs” for the Department are “noble experiment” and “creative enterprise” (p. 173). This short work has just 173 pages of text and unsurprisingly, given its unusual and extended provenance, is not a completely polished historical work. Schmidt's accounts of post-1978 events enhancing a “posthumous” negative reputation for Social Relations—for example, unsavory biographical revelations about Timothy Leary and the controversial charge that the Unabomber was tragically damaged by participation as a subject in Henry Murray's final experiments—rely on published sources already well known to, and sometimes strongly criticized by historians. The book's very real value, however, lies in the intimate picture it presents of the inside maneuvering and negotiations that underlay the establishment, maintenance, and ultimate dissolution of a historically important university department devoted to the social sciences.",en

This research aims to innovate by reintroducing this culture, particularly in housing and housing development cooperation. The reapplication of local wisdom (Gotong Royong culture) in this study is intended to ensure that the characteristics and identities of the Bajo people remain the basis for building their social capital. The researcher used a qualitative descriptive method with inductive and deductive approaches, along with a Value Engineering approach. This research was conducted within the Bajo Tribe's location, situated in Kabalutan Village, Tojo Una Una Regency, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia. The results of the study found that the application of the Gotong Royong culture to the Bajo community in building houses and housing produced efficiency and effectiveness. It was efficient because it reduced development costs and effective because it took advantage of free time to construct houses, fostering a sense of togetherness among fellow Bajo tribespeople and strengthening cooperation. Thus, Gotong Royong activities serve as a means of building effective social networks that can reduce the cost of constructing houses and revive the culture of Gotong Royong.",en

Synchronization and resynchronization programs have addressed abnormal ovarian function by effectively controlling follicular growth, regression of the corpus luteum, and time of ovulation relative to AI. Automated systems for estrous detection can reduce the effects of poor estrous expression on reproductive efficiency. Genetic selection indices are improving overall fertility as well as cows' productivity (milk production) and longevity. Despite the progress that has been made, we have not overcome the substantial effect that calving and subsequent lactation have on the fertility of postpartum dairy cows, which is typically 10% to 20% lower than a virgin heifer (Meier et al., 2021Meier S. McNaughton L.R. Handcock R. Amer P.R. Beatson P.R. Bryant J.R. Dodds K.G. Spelman R. Roche J.R. Burke C.R. Heifers with positive genetic merit for fertility traits reach puberty earlier and have a greater pregnancy rate than heifers with negative genetic merit for fertility traits.J.

In response to the need for new information on dairy cow fertility, we called for papers that specifically addressed this issue. Topics of interest included feeding transition and early postpartum cows; estrous cycle control, including resynchronization and systems for monitoring estrous behavior; improved methods of pregnancy diagnosis; uterine health; early embryonic development and placentation; early embryonic loss; and the genetic improvement of fertility traits. We accepted 14 articles primarily centered around periparturient disease, genetics, nutrition, embryo development, and pregnancy loss. These articles, which were submitted from North and South America and Europe, address some of the most important topics in dairy cow fertility. Periparturient disease of any type (metabolic, uterine, or ovarian) significantly affects the interval to pregnancy postpartum, as does the interval from calving to first ovulation (Gilbert, 2019Gilbert R.O. Symposium review: Mechanisms of disruption of fertility by infectious diseases of the reproductive tract.J. Dairy Sci. 2019; 102 (30772031): 3754-3765https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2018-15602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two articles in this special issue address uterine disease and the treatment of postpartum uterine disease, another article highlights the important interaction between cyclicity and disease, and a third article focuses on subclinical hypocalcemia, a metabolic disease that is common in dairy cows (Couto Serrenho et al., 2021Couto Serrenho R. DeVries T.J. Duffield T.F. LeBlanc S.J. Graduate student literature review: What do we know about the effects of clinical and subclinical hypocalcemia on health and performance of dairy cows?.J.

Postpartum nutrition is important for successful reproduction, but the mechanisms that link nutrition and reproduction are often unclear (Cardoso et al., 2020Cardoso F.C. Kalscheur K.F. Drackley J.K. Symposium review: Nutrition strategies for improved health, production, and fertility during the transition period.J.

These mechanisms, including the amount of starch and forage in the lactating cow's diet, were explored in a large study of 48 dairy farms, and revealed potential mechanisms through which the diet can affect reproduction. The possibility that chromium supplementation could improve reproduction postpartum was tested in a second study that identified an important relationship between chromium and immune function postpartum. Embryonic development following breeding and the mechanisms that dictate embryonic loss are of keen interest to the dairy community (Ealy and Seekford, 2019Ealy A.D. Seekford Z.K. Symposium review: Predicting pregnancy loss in dairy cattle.J. Dairy Sci. 2019; 102 (31587904): 11798-11804https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2019-17176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is reflected in the fact that nearly one-half of the accepted articles address embryonic development or pregnancy loss. The possibility that embryos fail to develop because they have abnormal chromosomal content is addressed. Two studies present new data on hormonal treatments that were designed to improve embryo transfer success. The magnitude of pregnancy loss over time is accurately defined in an article that employed a meta-analysis of 19,723 diagnostic records from 46 studies. The time of pregnancy loss relative to the function of the corpus luteum has been a question on the minds of reproductive biologists for some time. New data in this special issue bring clarity to this question by defining the time of embryonic loss relative to regression of the corpus luteum. Finally, the possibility that pregnancy loss can be detected remotely by using sensor technology was tested. Novel fertility traits were proposed in an article on activity measurements. These new traits are defined by fertility phenotypes collected by remote sensing technology. Trait development from data collected remotely will likely see greater emphasis in the future (Fleming et al., 2019Fleming A. Baes C.F. Martin A.A. Chud T.C.S. Malchiodi F. Brito L.F. Miglior F. Symposium review: The choice and collection of new relevant phenotypes for fertility selection.J.

In this study, a new trait, “calving to first high activity,” was defined. In addition to regular research articles, we received 2 review articles: the first on antral follicle counts, and a second titled “The high fertility cycle.” The former reviews the interesting relationship between the number of antral follicles present on the ovary and the fertility of the cow. The latter examines the importance of the timely establishment of pregnancy postpartum to maintaining an appropriate body condition that supports the overall health of the cow. This collection of papers will serve as a resource for those interested in dairy cow fertility and will benchmark several important topics.

Maskarinec: Dhaulagiri Journal, and MeThis paper focuses on my perception and memories of Professor Gregory Maskarinec, who passed away on June 16, 2022, at 71. Professor Maskarinec was a member of the International Advisory Board of the Dhaulagiri Journal of Sociology and Anthropology. He was also an author, reviewer, and financial endower. This paper discusses how Professor Maskarinec contributed to promoting journal publication and knowledge dissemination in the field of social sciences in Nepal. The paper aims to highlight the author's perception of devotion to the production and sharing of knowledge, encouragement and promotion to young scholars, and generosity for knowledge production and sharing. Despite limited interactions, I observed some crucial points that I could highlight about his nature and worldview. The information presented here is from my observation, exchanged emails, interviews, papers, field notes, and contributions to the Dhaulagiri Journal of Sociology and Anthropology. Professor Maskarinec has shown big lessons and a path for social sciences research scholars. He taught us the importance of having contact with the research subjects. I admire the simplicity of his life and his harmonious relationship with people of different social, cultural, linguistic, and religious identities. These behaviors are based on the cultural relativism that Professor Maskarinec possessed. I strongly felt that Professor Maskarinec was observing his death closely. As he noticed he was dying soon from cancer, he focused his valuable time on the most important spiritual actions. Maskarinec was familiar with Nepali customs and rituals that can be performed before and after the final departure of life. In my understanding, a financial endowment he provided to the Dhaulagiri Journal was a part of the ritual of dan (donation). He had also requested his close friend to perform rituals at Pasupati temple in Nepal. The conclusion is that we must follow a scholarly path, which is deeply engaged with the topics and subjects and respectfully committed to knowledge sharing.",en

https://openalex.org/W4385408640,2023,Sociology,"Celebrating the Emergence of SexualityLiving in a communal environment such as a nursing home or assisted living community is often accompanied by new experiences, possibly including a sense of being cared for the first time in one’s life or at least in a very long time. Some people may experience something akin to a personality transformation when they live in an environment where the staff has warmth and delight for residents, especially if they experience emotional responsiveness and presence. Surprisingly, this kind of care may stimulate the brain, even when there is cognitive impairment or significant health issues. For some, this might include a new sense of sexuality. By nature of being human, regardless of our age or cognitive or physical limitations, we are sexual beings, whether we are active sexually or not. The human reproductive system, with its attendant emotional and motivational capacities, is part of the sexuality system, one of seven emotional systems described by neuroscientist Jaak Panksepp, PhD, and Lucy Biven, MAEd. They describe these seven systems in detail in The Archaeology of Mind: Neuroevolutionary Origins of Human Emotions (W.W. Norton, 2012), where they distinguish them from simple emotional labels. For example, when we’re working really hard, we are using the Seeking system. When we’re goofing off with our children or our dogs or we’re making jokes, we are working within the Play system. When we turn toward others with concern for their needs, we are functioning from the Care system. When we lose someone to death, divorce, or a cross-country move, we activate the Panic/Grief system. When someone frightens us, we ignite the Fear system. When our resources are threatened and we act to protect them, we engage the Rage system. And finally, they classified sexual excitement as part of the Lust system, which we will be referring to here as the sexuality system. Like a metro system, each of these systems has its own track within the human brain, and the trains on each track are run by different fuels. Dopamine runs the Seeking system, Play relies on endocannabinoids, and Care runs on oxytocin and endogenous opioids. The Panic/Grief system runs on cortisol with a loss of oxytocin and endogenous opioids, Fear runs on glutamate and is concerned with endogenous benzodiazepines, and the Rage system runs on substance P, an undecapeptide. The hormones of the sexuality system include testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, oxytocin, and the human growth hormones. These hormones carry us from childhood to adulthood, and the timing of their release and subsidence regulates our life span. The more that we know about sexuality as a shared human phenomenon that persists until death, the more that we can appreciate it, and the safer and more enjoyable we can make our communities for older adults. The sexuality system, which encompasses the reproductive system, moves us from being a child in our family of origin into adult life where we may create families of our own and find friendship and community. As we grow, we become our own individual adult selves, with our own personalities, our own delights, and our own ways of solving problems. This growth process, called emergence, continues throughout the life span, well into our older years. And while our hormones may shift and change, they are always still present. This is why all of us continue to be moved by sexuality even when we are not sexually active. Being sexually active might involve anything from masturbation, pornography, or exhibitionism to conjugal relations, dating, or affairs, all of which can become more public and extreme as people lose their capacity for self-control and self-regulation after strokes or dementia. The incapacitating effects of aging limit the brain’s ability both to exercise choice about expressing sexuality and to recognize how we impact, offend, or harm others with our actions. By understanding sexuality as a lifelong process — one that may become less controlled with cognitive impairment — the staff may view less restrained sexuality as less distressing. Sexuality without sexual activity includes capacity for delight, new passions or interests, more responsiveness to kindness, greater relaxation and joke making, a newfound ability to be interested in others or to be kind to staff, greater capacity for gratitude or the expression of appreciation, greater physical relaxation with touch, more animated facial expressions and vocal tone, greater trust, and expanded involvement in the communal living environment. Those who retain their cognitive capacity may experience more creativity. Part of the wonder and frustration of caring for older adults in post-acute and long-term care settings is witnessing how people continue to change, sexually and otherwise. The process of becoming ourselves is never complete. Emergence, the experience led by the sexuality system, begins in our youth as we individuate and grow into our selves with our own preferences, delights, and personalities, and continues throughout the life span. As we reach older adulthood, people may begin to connect to and become more of their authentic selves as the things that prevented them from self-expression in earlier years — such as social pressures, trauma, and life circumstances — transform. For example, a woman whose childhood was filled with deprivation might have been rigid and controlling throughout her adulthood until she moved into a care setting — where she is suddenly no longer solely responsible for survival. She might relax and become interested in listening to jazz music, or she might participate in group activities for the first time in her life. People may blossom into new sexual experiences and identities, some of which may feature sexual activity or exploration. For instance, if someone has felt they’ve had to hide their sexual identity, remaining “closeted” due to family or community disapproval, they may feel free to express their true sexual preferences in an environment that supports LGBTQ+ inclusivity. It’s important to make these experiences feel welcome so that older adults can continue to heal trauma and live full, meaningful lives. Sexuality is a complex issue with many layers. In the nursing home setting, the focus tends to be on the challenges of sexuality and intimacy, including consent, capacity determination, and creating a safe environment in which to live and work. In every way, safety needs to be a part of all decisions. But if we try to make sexuality disappear, environments will become repressive and unsafe, forcing sexuality to become a secret or hidden experience. Ultimately, there is no way to legislate the appearance and development of our sexuality at any age, any more than we can legislate the development of our brains, lungs, and blood vessels. By understanding and celebrating the shared human needs for sexuality and self expression, the way in which people’s emergence comes alive, we can make sure our communities feel safe, inclusive, and person-centered. What this looks like is ultimately led by the individuals and how they respond to our care. When we see people responding to our care with emergence, we know we are on the right track! For instance, when we notice that a resident is receptive to physical touch and relaxes with a hug, and we give them more hugs and touch, we will see them respond to life with more smiles, laughter, and ease. Or if we discover that individuals who have little capacity for movement enjoy a certain kind of music and we bring this into their lives, we will see excitement and engagement even if they are nonverbal. Such powerful signs of emergence are a testimony to the safety and warmth of the care environment. Likewise, if there are no signs of emergence among residents, consider the systems and processes that support the staff in making the environment supportive and person-centered for residents. And as we begin to notice, support, and celebrate emergence, we will all experience more joy.

https://openalex.org/W4380589809,2023,Sociology,"Moving from pathology to politicized care: Examining Black school leaders' perspectives on school disciplineSchool discipline is a significant educational policy and equity issue in K-12 education in the United States due to well-documented racial inequality in students’ disciplinary outcomes and the deleterious effects of exclusionary discipline on academic and adult outcomes. The roles and approaches of school leaders in the production of racial inequality in exclusionary discipline warrant further inquiry. In this qualitative case study, we apply the theoretical lenses of politicized caring and internalized racism to 12 semi-structured interviews with Black principals and assistant principals in an urban emergent district in Southeastern U.S. to examine how Black school leaders make sense of and address racial disparities in school discipline. The findings illustrate that Black school leaders’ disciplinary perspectives and practices are complex with four major themes emerging: (a) deficit thinking and pathologization, (b) internalized racism, (c) politicized care as a disciplinary ideology and (d) politicized care in disciplinary practice. Uplifting the voices of Black school leaders reveals the pervasive nature of racism and the complex ways in which Black educators attempt to dismantle inequitable patterns. The findings highlight the need to create unique support for Black school leaders to enhance their disciplinary practices through mentorship, coaching and professional development.",en

It is observed that key urban stakeholders such as brokers, landowners, neighborhood resident families, and hostel wardens informed by cis-heteronormative moralities work in tandem in shaping the student housing market. The article argues, first, that these powerful urban stakeholders collectively contribute to two mutually feeding phenomena—”studentphobia” and “cis-heteronormative familification”—which in turn effectuate a homonegative labyrinth of representational distortions of the HE-LGBTQ+ student-image. Secondly, when compounded with an increasingly unaffordable urban housing market in the finance capital of India, it results in relatively acute experiences of “spatial dysphoria” for HE-LGBTQ+ students that cannot be comprehended within the neat binary of socio-spatial un/belonging. Methodologically, this article takes a trans-disciplinary approach to analyze the spatial stories of disbelonging of 13 HE-LGBTQ+ students that follow three stages: (a) securing a home, (b) making a home, and (c) leaving home. The article concludes that what is needed to enable a sense of belonging for HE-LGBTQ+ students in India is not necessarily “LGBTQ+ inclusive” or, for that matter, “exclusively LGBTQ+” housing; rather, it is for planning practices to take on queer and trans approaches that undo cis-heteronormativity in urban housing and homes.",en

Contrary to the belief that antiblack racism exists offshore in distant lands away from celebrated multicultural Australia, this article demonstrates how antiblackness lives within the nation. Despite antiblack racism’s strong hold, young people in classrooms are detecting it, suspending it, and producing antiracist literacies and Black futurities through multidisciplinary questioning. Drawing from public data, existing empirical research, and primary classroom research in Australia, this article traces how antiblack racism moves in the public space, the school classrooms, and the official curriculum. It also demonstrates how both in the margins and at the center of the curriculum, young people, aided by popular moving images of Afrofuturism, are able to defy the “ontologically lacking” logics that order antiblack literacy.

At this time, hijrah has become a popular movement among the younger generation of Indonesia which is marked by the many hijrah communities that have sprung up in various cities, such as the Siram Tasik community (Mosque Youth Symphony) which is one of the communities engaged in religious activities in the City of Tasikmalaya. Apart of conducting regular studies, the Siram Tasik community also presents mentors to provide specific materials that are problematic among the younger generation. Therefore, the author is interested in researching the phenomenon of hijrah in Tasikmalaya City known as the City of Santri through the Siram Tasik community to find out the initial purpose of creating this community and how big the positive impact is for society, especially teenagers in Tasikmalaya City. This research was conducted using the interview method with several members of Siram Tasik and participant who actively participated in activities held by this community&#x0D; Keywords: Hijrah; Muslim; Milennials; Community",en

This paper contributes towards efforts to build ‘just’ and equitable urban sustainability, and more specifically greenspace management, by drawing attention to hostility and exclusion experienced by two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, genderqueer, pansexual, transsexual, intersex and gender-variant (2SLGBTQ+) park occupants. There is evidence that access to greenspace is inequitable—despite ongoing media accounts of targeted violence and discriminatory police patrolling of 2SLGBTQ+ communities in urban parks, this population has not received adequate research attention. This paper examines systemic barriers that impede urban greenspace access among 2SLGBTQ+ communities, including how the threat of violence in greenspace limits opportunities for accessing benefits associated with naturalized settings. These themes are explored within the context of the City of Toronto, Canada. Our mixed-method approach draws upon key informant interviews, key document content analysis, and ground-truthing. Our findings reveal how queer corporeality, kinship and love subvert deeply entrenched heteronormative social values and understandings of sexuality, partnership, gender, and use of public space, challenging institutional understandings of morality and daily life. The paper concludes by reflecting on the state of 2SLGBTQ+ communities’ relationships to greenspace, and potential ways forward in building greater inclusivity into the social fabric of park design and management.&lt;/p&gt;",en

Specifically, as a multilingual and diverse group of educators, we chose to use Latin@/o Critical Theory (LatCrit) as our methodology to align with the epistemological framework of YPAR. By sharing the lived experiences and insights of the two educators over the course of the program, our reflexive study demonstrates how multimodal ways of meaning making supported them in challenging deficient perspectives of minoritized languages and in changing their pedagogical practices to be more equitable. By implementing YPAR programs with a clear focus on CMLA, we become aware of our own language ideologies and grow to understand the socio-political discourses that inform our interactions with youth. Implications include the significance of incorporating multimodality and participatory pedagogies into teacher education and thereby facilitating opportunities for teacher candidates to gain awareness of the power dynamics in multilingual education.",en

This study used a single completely randomized design (CRD), namely aging time (7 days, 14 days, and 21 days) with three replications for each treatment. The results of the analysis showed that the aging time used in the manufacture of black garlic from local Lumbu Hijau garlic varieties significantly affected the color intensity, water content, protein content, fat content, ash content, carbohydrate content, total reducing sugar, total phenol, and antioxidant activity (p≤0.05). The appropriate aging time for the production of black garlic from the local Lumbu Hijau garlic variety is 14 days, which gives a yield of 80.81%; texture of 8.90 g /5 mm; color intensity 0.52%; water content 61.77%; protein content 16.65%; fat content of 1.28%; ash content 4.05%; carbohydrate content of 29.82%; reducing sugar 3.94%; total titrated acid (TTA) of 0.26%; acidity (pH) 3.01; total phenol 0.91%; and antioxidant activity 61.62%. It can be concluded that the production of black garlic from Lumbu Hijau offers good potential for development because processed fresh garlic to black garlic increased antioxidant activity. The next step needs to be a diversification of the processed food products made from black garlic derived from Lumbu Hijau.",en

However, as dry bulk shipping market is always influenced by unanticipated economic, financial or political events, structural breaks exist in vessel price volatility, while the price volatility characteristics under structural breaks have not been well identified. This paper aims to investigate the vessel price volatility under structural breaks caused by external events. The modified ICSS algorithm is applied to detect the structural break points and GARCH model incorporating structural breaks is used to examine the volatility of newbuilding and second-hand vessel prices of four dry bulk vessel types using monthly data from January 2002 to November 2012. Results show that the price volatility's persistence effect and clustering effect decrease when structural breaks in variance are accounted. The findings may contribute to the literature in vessel price volatility modelling under structural breaks and may be helpful for practitioners.",en

We use European Statistics on Income and Living Conditions data (EU‐SILC) for 26 European countries between 2009 and 2018. In addition to describing the development of long‐term poverty, we also analyse the drivers of poverty on the country level via fixed effects panel regression analysis. We are particularly interested in how economic growth, employment rates, social expenditure, and short‐term poverty rates are related to long‐term poverty. Overall, the results show that long‐term poverty has increased in 13 out of 26 countries, but was unchanged or decreased in 13 countries. Gross domestic product growth is not related to the development of long‐term poverty. However, we find that male employment and social welfare expenditure reduce poverty rates. Furthermore, short‐term poverty is negatively associated with long‐term poverty. Hence, short‐term poverty and long‐term poverty rather substitute than complement each other.",en

We find debt ratio outturns exceeding projected values with forecast errors increasing over a four-year horizon. Larger errors arise where the initial debt ratio exceeds the Maastricht Treaty threshold of 60 per cent. In modelling the forecast errors of the debt ratio, we find that most of the variation is explained by forecast errors in the output growth rate and in the structural budget balance, as well as previous errors in projecting the debt ratio. During the sample period, member states who had not met their medium-term objective of a balanced structural budget were expected to adhere to a net expenditure rule. For countries subject to this requirement, we find undue optimism arising in forecasting the deficit ratio, a determinant of the debt ratio. The implications of these findings for EU policymakers and, in particular, forecasters are considered.",en

Though, there are rare empirical inquiries in relation to the energy firms’ capital structure determinants for the firms functioning in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Therefore, this study is an attempt to discover the capital structure determinants of energy firms that are functioning in the six key economies of ASEAN region which are Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, Cambodia and Vietnam. In this setting, a total of 144 energy firms’ yearly Panel Data is involved over 14 years period from 2007 to 2020. The seven core determinants of capital structure, namely tangibility, return on equity, current ratio, non-debt tax shield, inflation and annual gross domestic product are inspected in relation to capital structure which is measured by ratio of debt to total asset. Employing both Panel Data models that are Static and Dynamic models via using robust estimator i.e. Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), the results reveal that tangibility and profitability are the most prominent determinants among all others. Evidently, the two newly introduced capital structure determinants that are inflation and energy consumption for ASEAN region energy firms are also reported significant by dissimilar estimators. The significant character of tangibility, profitability and lagged dependent variable directly infers the relevance of Dynamic Trade-Off theory. The findings provide new ways for policy makers to construct parallel strategies which will not only help out to overcome the energy scarcity issues but also to enhance regional level integration.",en

This paper aimed to assess the link between taxation and economic growth in the European Union Member States, considering panel data for the period 2000-2021 to identify taxation’s specific implications on economic growth. The methodological endeavour encompassed both qualitative and quantitative research approaches. The qualitative analysis of the study involved a bibliometric analysis of the existing literature and visual mapping of the bibliographic data employed to highlight the differences between the values of the variables recorded in the EU countries. The quantitative research methodology assumed the empirical analysis through a panel data regression with fixed and random effects to identify the reaction of the growth rate of the gross domestic product to changes in direct and indirect taxes. Our results indicate a relationship between taxation and economic growth, depending on the tax type. We have identified a direct relationship in the case of taxes on the income or profits of corporations, including holding gains and value-added taxes and an indirect relationship in the case of taxes on individual or household income including holding gains and other taxes on production. In addition, the impact of indirect taxes is more significant. These specific relationships influence the change in fiscal policies in response to economic shocks.",en

Design/methodology/approach Using regression analysis, the authors investigate how firm size and idiosyncratic risk impact price momentum. The authors review firm price data in 25 country markets in the Thomson Financial Datastream database from 1979 to 2009. Findings This study’s findings suggest price momentum is more significant among stocks with smaller size and higher idiosyncratic risk. The authors find that winner and loser portfolios have significantly smaller size and higher idiosyncratic risk than portfolios in the middle quintiles. Research limitations/implications This study’s results are consistent with the notion that firm size matters in price momentum and mispricing is greatest for small firms because of the greater risk potential to arbitrageurs. In addition, this finding that firms with higher idiosyncratic risk have greater price momentum supports the idea that investors underreact to firm-specific information. Practical implications This work finds evidence that investors underreact to firm-specific information. As such, these findings are of particular interest for investors looking to exploit opportunities for abnormal returns through price momentum trading. Originality/value This paper jointly examines the effects of firm size and idiosyncratic risk on momentum returns. This investigation considers these effects in the global markets. This work adds to the research base by illustrating that both winner and loser portfolios have significantly smaller size and higher idiosyncratic risk than portfolios in the middle quintiles.

This study utilized the introduction of a new higher tier of the Old Age Living Allowance (OALA) in Hong Kong in June 2018 as its experimental condition. It examined the impact of the higher OALA on economic activity, financial transfers from non-co-resident adult children, household income, household expenditure, income-based poverty, and expenditure-based poverty among Hong Kong's older adults. Supported by three waves of data collected in 2015, 2017, and 2019 from a sample, we designed a quasi-experiment and estimated the triple differences in the six outcome variables. The findings show that the higher OALA impacted the institutionalized life course by reducing financial transfers from non-co-resident adult children and significantly increased income-based and expenditure-based poverty. Findings reveal the crowding-out effect of the higher OALA and motivate a discussion of the nature of reduced financial transfers from non-co-resident adult children among older adults in Hong Kong.",en
https://openalex.org/W4360950902,2023,Economics,"Fundamental character of the risk premium to influence the sustainability of the public debt&lt;p&gt;&lt;big&gt;Traditionally, conditions of sustainability of the public debt have long been related quite exclusively to fiscal policy and to budgetary parameters. However, the interaction between fiscal and monetary policies regarding the fixation of the interest rate is fundamental. Indeed, a simple analytical modelling shows that if the nominal interest rate increases exponentially with the public debt, because of a default (credit) risk premium, if the confidence of investors is fundamental, conditions of sustainability of the public debt could be much more difficult to comply with. Indeed, if the interest rate is risk-free, values for which the public debt can be sustainable are less constraining if the long-term GDP growth rate is high, or if the long-term risk-free nominal interest rate is small. They are also less constraining if the country decides to turn to a non-negligible primary budget surplus in case of a high public debt. However, if the interest rate exponentially increases with the public debt level, in case of a significant importance of the default (credit) risk premium, these parameters have very limited consequences on sustainable and equilibrium public debt levels. The sustainable public debt that a government should target is then much smaller than in absence of this risk premium.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",en

To isolate the contribution of multinational enterprises' (MNEs) tax optimization to the decline in productivity, we then exploit the 2006 Cadbury-Schweppes decision of the European Court of Justice limiting the extent to which member States can counter European MNEs' tax planning strategies. We find that multinational groups benefiting from that loosening of the legal constraints do exhibit a lower labor productivity following that ruling.

The regression analysis with the arch model indicates that the rise of federal funds rates has some extent explaining power on the decrease of metal futures prices, as shown by the significant negative relationship between them. Intuitively, an increase in interest rates reduces currency liquidity and suppresses the demand for commodities such as non-ferrous metals, thus the decrease of their prices. Besides, this research also identifies a significant correlation between futures prices and M2, with a positive correlation between the means of their variables and a negative correlation between the variances of the variables. The metal spot price reasonably predicts its corresponding future prices, as those two prices are found significantly positively correlated with coefficients around 0.9-1.1.",en

For example, one network approach estimates the degree of connectedness between countries through the beta-coefficients (β) of linear regressions of each market’s bond index against the bond indexes of each of the others.

In addition, it evaluates how financial and employment shocks affect the labor market and monetary policy variables over six different U.S. business-cycle peaks. It identifies a parsimonious Time-Varying Vector Autoregressive model with Stochastic Volatility (TVP-VAR-SV) with the labor share of income, the employment rate, residential investment, and the interest rate spread as endogenous variables. Using Bayesian inference methods, key results suggest (i) a combination of profit-led demand and profit-squeeze distribution; (ii) weakening of these regimes during the Great Moderation; and (iii) significant connections between the standard Goodwinian variables and residential investment as well as term spreads.

Using the United Nations Comtrade database, providing the frame of the world trade network associated to 194 UN countries during the decade 2010 - 2020, we study a mathematical model of influence battle of three currencies, namely, the US dollar, the euro, and such a hypothetical BRICS currency. In this model, a country trade preference for one of the three currencies is determined by a multiplicative factor based on trade flows between countries and their relative weights in the global international trade. The three currency seed groups are formed by 9 eurozone countries for the euro, 5 Anglo-Saxon countries for the US dollar and the 5 BRICS countries for the new proposed currency. The countries belonging to these 3 currency seed groups trade only with their own associated currency whereas the other countries choose their preferred trade currency as a function of the trade relations with their commercial partners. The trade currency preferences of countries are determined on the basis of a Monte Carlo modeling of Ising type interactions in magnetic spin systems commonly used to model opinion formation in social networks. We adapt here these models to the world trade network analysis. The results obtained from our mathematical modeling of the structure of the global trade network show that as early as 2012 about 58 percent of countries would have preferred to trade with the BRICS currency, 23 percent with the euro and 19 percent with the US dollar. Our results announce favorable prospects for a dominance of the BRICS currency in international trade, if only trade relations are taken into account, whereas political and other aspects are neglected.",en

We analyzed Compustat data for Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Spain for the 2006–2015 period, focusing on discretionary accruals. We considered three tax avoidance measures, two based on the effective tax rate (ETR) and one on book-tax differences (BTD). Our results indicate the presence of nonlinear patterns and a positive, statistically significant relationship between discretionary accruals and both ETR indicators implying that when companies resort to earnings management, a larger taxable income—and thus higher ETR and lesser tax avoidance– would ensue. Hence, as also highlighted by the fact that discretionary accruals do not appear to affect BTD, our evidence does not suggest that companies are exploiting tax manipulation to reduce their tax payments; thus, the gap between accounting and taxation seems largely unaffected by earnings management.",en

Results of impulse – response function suggest that in LFDCs, while financial inclusion and financial stability are positively correlated, they are negatively correlated with the inflation rate and the money supply growth rate. In HFDCs, financial inclusion is positively corelated with inflation rate and money supply growth rate, while financial stability is negatively correlated with financial inclusion, inflation rate and money supply growth rate. These findings imply that in LFDCs, financial inclusion increases financial stability and reduces inflation. In HFDCs, on the contrary, financial inclusion increases financial instability, leading to long-term inflation.

Out‐of‐sample portfolio back‐testing shows that vine copulas reduce portfolio risk better than the benchmark portfolio strategies and also better than simple multivariate copulas. Overall, we find that mixed vine copula models perform best with regard to risk reduction, both for the entire period 2001–2022 and during financial crises periods.

In this direction, a TVP-VAR model is adopted to test the transmission effect on seven commodities' prices using monthly data over the period 2003:4 to 2018:6. The evidence supports Frankel’s (2006) model on the transmission mechanism of the inventory arbitrage activity and the speculative activity on the effect of the real interest rate on commodities' real prices in the short run during the US QE policy period. Moreover, speculative activity appears to increase the effect of the interest rate on commodities' prices in the current period, whilst the evidence between inventory arbitrage activity and the interest rate on commodities' prices is found to be mixed. Further analysis indicates that the transmission of arbitrage activities concerning the effect of the interest rate on commodities' prices is influenced by the arbitrage condition between the commodity and the interest rate markets as well as the changes in commodities' futures basis. More specifically, the inventory arbitrage activities of precious metals and energy commodities play a significant role in transmitting the effect of the interest rate on their prices whilst energy commodities' price is more flexible than other commodities' prices in response to a shock from both inventory arbitrage and speculative activities. Lastly, the influence of the interest rate, the inventory arbitrage activity and the speculative activity is found to be stronger during the de-financialization period.",en

However, adjustment is not always instantaneous. This paper utilizes an Error-Corrected Linear Approximate Almost Ideal Demand System (EC-LAAIDS) model to analyze the import demand for meat and seafood in Indonesia from 1976 to 2020 using annual data. The study found that the theoretical restrictions of homogeneity and symmetry held in the EC-LAAIDS model but did not in the long-run model. The adjustment parameter reveals that imported mutton had the slowest adjustment to long-run equilibrium, while all other meats and seafood had a moderate adjustment speed. The study calculated income elasticities for both the short- and long-run revealing that imported beef was a luxury good in the short-run and most responsive to changes in income. In the short-run, imported poultry was the least responsive to changes in income. In the long-run, all imported meats were found to be luxuries except for imported seafood and beef. Uncompensated price elasticity of demand reveals that in the short-run all imported items had inelastic demand except for imported beef which had elastic demand. In the long-run, however, imported beef and pork had elastic demand, while all other items were inelastic. Compensated cross-price elasticities found that mostly substitution relationships existed among pairs of imported commodities.

Furthermore, this study examines which of the three assets provide the lowest volatility and identifies if the univariate GARCH (1,1) model can suitably forecast the volatility of the foreign exchange market, commodity market and cryptocurrency market. More specifically, this study uses only estimates from a symmetric GARCH model for the XAU/USD, WTI/USD and BTC/USD financial assets. Although the literature on the volatility of different assets is extensive, it neglects to detect the severe economic recession that is approaching. Considering that powerful nations purchased substantial quantities of gold in order to back their national currency, supremacy of the US dollar is under significant attack. Experts in international relations have claimed that it is essential to have a single, extremely influential national economy to exhibit stability and operate smoothly. Specifically, the international monetary system functioned under the theory of hegemonic stability. Given the fact that gold still remains the safe haven asset during periods of financial and economic distress, central banks are purchasing gold at a rapid pace with Russia and China leading the way. Furthermore, the demand for precious metals has also increased while the US dollar is struggling to keep its supremacy as BRICS reserve currency is seeking to replace it in the future.

Apart from investigating baseline UIP regressions, we check for structural breaks in this relationship, scrutinize deviations from the UIP, and employ different estimation methods and models augmented with various risk measures. Moreover, we offer several extensions to the common UIP testing that account for foreign-exchange interventions, the implied volatility of exchange rates, and the limited availability of data on direct measures of market expectations. The study shows that the choice of the reference currency matters for the outcome of the interest parity tests in the CEE economies. In particular, we demonstrate that inconsistencies between the results of the UIP tests vis-à-vis the euro and the US dollar that appear in CEE economies may be accounted for by the movements of the euro-dollar risk premium. This regularity has not been documented in previous studies. Additionally, we show that (a) the FX interventions in Czechia distorted the UIP, (b) the directly measured exchange rate expectations (granular survey data) in Poland do not seem to be informed by the UIP relationship, (c) the limited resilience of CEE economies to rare disasters may plausibly explain deviations from the UIP.",en

We build an agent-based model inspired by the literature on behavioral finance and by empirical surveys about the behavior of foreign exchange professionals. In our artificial economy, traders allocate their wealth across heterogeneous assets based on expectations about exchange and interest rate fluctuations. Fundamentalists use both fundamental and technical signals, but overweight the former, while chartists only employ technical signals, and are either trend followers or trend contrarians. Each class of traders represents a fixed share of total traders. We find that the simultaneous co-existence of heterogeneous strategies can explain most stylized facts of foreign exchange markets, despite the absence of short-run switching from less to more profitable rules. Moreover, contrary to the predictions of the Market Selection Hypothesis, we find that heterogeneity of expectations is an essential requirement for traders’ profitability, as no class of traders can dominate the market profitably.",en

However, the market pricing anomaly of the near-zero swap spread violates the non-arbitrage assumption. Investigating the dynamics of pricing factors on interest rate swaps is meaningful to explain near-zero swap spreads. This paper employs a vector autoregressive model with time-varying parameters (TVP-VAR) model to examine the dynamic effects of pricing factors on swap spreads from a business cycle perspective. An analysis of the main three swaps with 1-year, 2-year, and 5-years maturities indicates that the TVP-VAR model accurately describes the time-varying features of the economic determinants. The TVP-VAR model has higher forecasting accuracy than the TVP model, particularly in the first-three months after the start of Covid-19 pandemic. The level, interest rate volatility (or economic policy uncertainty index), and stock market volatility as the proxies for hedging demands show opposite effects to the theoretical predictions. These effects are evident before 2010 (international financial crisis), during a short period in 2015 (stock market crashes), and after 2019 (Covid-19 pandemic).

Information obtained shows that the detected changes correspond to both global and domestic events. Results also showed that volatility persistence is reduced in a controlled volatility change model compared to a model ignoring volatility changes.

The results of the Bayesian estimation provide evidence in favor of a sizeable underground sector in Spain, with the associated tax evasion having contributed, on average, to 23% of public debt accumulation over the period 1985–2015. From the standpoint of fiscal policy, the estimated results show that the presence of tax evasion triggers a resource-reallocation mechanism that dampens the effects on economic activity caused by an increase in government spending, while it amplifies those due to changes in tax rates. Because of this mechanism, we show that tax-based consolidation plans may become completely ineffective in reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio if tax enforcement is imperfect. Moreover, by characterizing the long-run Laffer curve, we show that the actual taxation in Spain is inefficiently too high, in the sense that the government might increase tax revenues by cutting the actual tax rates on both corporate and personal income.",en

The ARDL results revealed that economic globalization has a positive and significant effect on poverty headcount in the short run. This finding is synonymous with the long-run results, which showed evidence of a significant positive effect of economic globalization on poverty headcount. The implication of this finding is that the benefits of economic globalization in terms of trade in goods and services, trade regulations and agreements, FDI inflows, portfolio investments, foreign debt, and other forms of financial globalization have not trickled down to the poor.The results further showed that social globalization has a negative and significant effect on poverty headcount. However, there is evidence of positive and insignificant effects of political globalization on poverty headcount in both the long and short run. Given the findings, it is recommended that policymakers prioritize social globalization to trickle-down its intended and desired benefits of poverty reduction.",en

We show that firm heterogeneity always reduces the number of firms in equilibrium, and that vertical and horizontal market growth have different effects on industry population and firm dynamics. Vertical market growth always promotes entry and growth of new firms, but heterogeneity weakens this effect. For horizontal market growth, we identify two growth regimes: incumbents dominate in large markets with significant heterogeneity, while new entrants grow faster in smaller markets with low heterogeneity. In contrast to existing research, we show that higher degrees of heterogeneity among potential firms reduces entry rates in both cases.",en

The novelty in this research is the argument that the true markups are compounded—they incorporate the markups already existing in the intermediate goods and services (inputs) that a company purchases in a vertical chain of production. A complex market structure, one in which companies sell and purchase intermediate products from each other in both horizontal and vertical directions, is the perfect environment for inflating a price well above its natural level. This research may help understanding the true extent of market power. Market power has a substantial impact in such matters as income inequality, standard of living, and economic development.

I split the sample (1994–2017) into prefinancialization (1994–2003) and postfinancialization (2004–2017). I directly test whether the CIT market share (CIT/open interest) contributes to commodity returns and whether risk adjustments (based on momentum, basis, basis‐momentum, open interest, crowding, and average factors) alter liquidity and insurance premiums documented in Kang, Rouwenhorst, and Tang. I also examine how the financialization affects liquidity and insurance premiums.

This assumption is motivated by the observation that the more technologically advanced the leader is, the harder it is for a follower to leapfrog without incurring extra cost for using leader’s patented knowledge. Under this R &amp;D cost structure, leaders have an incentive to play an “endpoint strategy"": they increase their technological advantage, counting on the fact that followers will eventually stop innovating—allowing leadership to prevail. We find that several results in the standard model fail to hold. In addition to the high -growth steady state in which only followers innovate, there now exists a second saddle-path-stable steady state: a low -growth steady state that features both leaders and followers innovating. A policy that increases monopolistic rents or extends parent duration can push the economy toward the low-growth steady state, causing, in some cases, irreversible harm to long-run growth.",en

Empirically, I establish that during times of high disagreement, prices respond more sluggishly in response to monetary shocks. These stickier prices cause a flatter Phillips curve, leading to the empirical result that monetary policy has stronger real (output) effects in high disagreement periods. I develop a tractable theoretical model that show rationally inattentive price-setters produce this result. The model also links disagreement and uncertainty – two fundamentally different concepts, and bridges the results of this paper to the literature on state-dependent monetary transmission. The main result highlights a role for improved central bank communications that reduce disagreement among economic agents, which lessens output falls when implementing disinflationary monetary policies.",en

We characterize the collusive outcome that results from Nash bargaining and compare it to the non-cooperative outcome. If the public firm’s taste for consumer surplus is mild, both firms reduce output (as in a private duopoly). If it is intermediate, while the public firm reduces output, the private firm expands output to such an extent that total output increases. If it is strong, the private firm’s output expansion does not compensate for the public firm’s output contraction, and thus total output decreases. We also characterize collusion sustainability, and assess the impact of relative bargaining power, degree of cost convexity, public firm’s taste for total surplus, and cost asymmetry. We conclude that, by reducing the productive inefficiency that is caused by the public firm being more expansionary, collusion may lead to higher profits and consumer surplus.",en
https://openalex.org/W4385978002,2023,Economics,"Pricing Multi-Event-Triggered Catastrophe Bonds Based on a Copula–POT ModelThe constantly expanding losses caused by frequent natural disasters pose many challenges to the traditional catastrophe insurance market. The purpose of this paper is to develop an innovative and systemic trigger mechanism for pricing catastrophic bonds triggered by multiple events with an extreme dependence structure. Due to the bond’s low cashflow contingencies and the CAT bond’s high return, the multiple-event CAT bond may successfully transfer the catastrophe risk to the huge financial markets to meet the diversification of capital allocations for most potential investors. The designed hybrid trigger mechanism helps reduce the moral hazard and increase the bond’s attractiveness with a lower trigger likelihood, displaying the determinants of the wiped-off coupon and principal by both the magnitude and intensity of the natural disaster events involved. As the trigger indicators resulting from the potential catastrophic disaster might be associated with heavy-tailed margins, nested Archimedean copulas are introduced with marginal distributions modeled by a POT-GP distribution for excess data and common parametric models for moderate risks. To illustrate our theoretical pricing framework, we conduct an empirical analysis of pricing a three-event rainstorm CAT bond based on the resulting losses due to rainstorms in China during 2006–2020. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out to analyze the sensitivity of the rainstorm CAT bond price in trigger attachment levels, maturity date, catastrophe intensity, and numbers of trigger indicators.",en

We empirically investigate the nexus among external debt portfolios, exchange rate cyclicality, and volatility in consumption of low- and middle-income countries. Since 1980, many countries have concentrated their external debt portfolios’ currency composition. By constructing debt-weighted effective exchange rates, we find that currency concentration magnifies exchange rate pro-cyclicality, making domestic consumption more volatile when national income fluctuates. Our results endorse diversifying the currency composition of external debt to mitigate the negative consequences of “original sin.”",en

In addition, export product variety and export market variety of the labor-intensive firms increase more than the others during a currency depreciation. In particular, the increase in the exports of the labor-intensive firms is 2.7 percent higher than the increase in exports of the non-labor-intensive firms in case of a 10 percent decline in the real effective exchange rate.

The research method are as follows: firstly, collect the original data, then simulate the stock price by using the Black-Scholes model and simulate the commodity price by using the Geometric Brownian Motion model. Last, compare the result. The outcome demonstrates that the stock price may be successfully simulated using the Black-Scholes model using crude oil commodities futures as the underlying asset.

Using the United Nations Comtrade database, providing the frame of the world trade network associated to 194 UN countries during the decade 2010–2020, we study a mathematical model of influence battle of three currencies, namely, the US dollar, the euro, and such a hypothetical BRICS currency. In this model, a country trade preference for one of the three currencies is determined by a multiplicative factor based on trade flows between countries and their relative weights in the global international trade. The three currency seed groups are formed by 9 eurozone countries for the euro, 5 Anglo-Saxon countries for the US dollar and the 5 BRICS countries for the new proposed currency. The countries belonging to these 3 currency seed groups trade only with their own associated currency whereas the other countries choose their preferred trade currency as a function of the trade relations with their commercial partners. The trade currency preferences of countries are determined on the basis of a Monte Carlo modeling of Ising type interactions in magnetic spin systems commonly used to model opinion formation in social networks. We adapt here these models to the world trade network analysis. The results obtained from our mathematical modeling of the structure of the global trade network show that as early as 2012 about 58% of countries would have preferred to trade with the BRICS currency, 23% with the euro and 19% with the US dollar. Our results announce favorable prospects for a dominance of the BRICS currency in international trade, if only trade relations are taken into account, whereas political and other aspects are neglected.",en
https://openalex.org/W4388658180,2023,Philosophy,"The Reason of MysticismThe Reason of Mysticism Michael Marder i In a lecture he gave at the Royal Institute of Philosophy in London on March 4, 1966, under the title ""The Logic of Mysticism,"" John Niemeyer Findlay concluded: ""Mysticism is a logical matter."" He immediately added a proviso: ""but a logic is only acceptable if it finds the sort of empirical material to fit it, and the right sort of material must include worlds and lives stricken with less dispersion and diversity than our present life"" (182). Despite brushing aside the transcendental foundations of logic, Findlay expresses, perhaps better and with greater clarity than anyone else, an aspiration to accommodate mysticism on the traditional terrain of philosophy. While the 1966 lecture places an emphasis on logic, in his other works Findlay defends, more generally speaking, a ""rational mysticism"" as the kind of strain of thought that is classifiable and digestible within the philosophical disciplinary and epistemological paradigm. For Findlay, ""mysticism is essentially a frame of mind connected with an absolute of some sort, meaning by an absolute an object of a very peculiar type having very peculiar logical properties"" (171). Sympathetic as the philosopher is to mysticism, he cannot help but reduce it to an object, albeit of the absolute type, and goes on to identify the object's ""logical properties."" In turn, the theologian who coined the term ""rational mysticism"" in the first decades of the twentieth century, Henry W. Clark, acknowledges that ""mysticism is not, except incidentally, a matter of knowledge. It is a matter of something else and something more"" (316). This something else is the experience of unity, which is conceptually translated by Findlay into ""empirical material"" and which actually realizes the systemic desideratum of reason: ""Through the mystical experience the completely unified system which reason insists upon having is brought about—not perceived but brought about […] Mysticism, then, when it understands itself aright and explains itself truly, remains entirely reasonable just because it does not attempt to substitute itself for reason, but does what, according to reason, requires to be done"" (322). In other words, we would do mysticism a disservice if we were to understand it on the grounds of (formal) reason and knowledge; and yet, the duty of reason is finally discharged by its presumed other, namely mysticism. [End Page 111] The fraught relation between rationalism and mysticism is not, however, the subject of this essay. Suffice it to say that, in and of itself, the treatment of diverse bodies of writing, spiritual practices, experiences, and modes of interpreting reality under the heading of mysticism not only homogenizes them but also pre-digests them for philosophical consumption. Any -ism is manifestly unfair, oversimplistic, and downright harmful toward whatever it labels in a broad sweep of generalization. This is even more so the case with mysticism. What does interest me is the place of reason in mystical traditions. For, contrary to the intellectual caricatures of these traditions, reason is not anathema to mystical experiences; it is a partial, if often requisite, way to relating to the absolute unity of existence (and inexistence). ii In the visions of St. Hildegard von Bingen, psychic states and vegetation, the physical elements and reason, are connected by the ties of similitude.1 The human microcosm condenses in itself and reflects the macrocosm: ""the human contains in itself the likeness of heaven and earth [homo similitudinem caeli et terrae continet in se]"" (Scivias II.1.2; Corpus 43 113).2 If so, then human reason, far from utterly idiosyncratic and anthropocentric, is a miniature reflection of world reason, which, in its turn, is nothing like a disembodied rationality, but a jointure of disparate, even opposed, elemental domains. The similitude, therefore, is itself double: just as the world is both divided into and interconnected as heaven and earth, so the human is two in one and one in two, a soul and a body. The human is the ""circle, which contains clarity, breath and reason [rationalitas] as the sky has its lights, air and winged creatures [volatilia]"" and ""the receptacle containing humidity, germination, and birth, as the earth has its fertility, fruition, and animals"" (ibid.). Rationalitas, which is Hildegard's word for reason...",en

They called for unity, harmony and the need to build a country based on catholic teaching of the Church. The clergy from Włocławek sympathized with the National Democracy – that was the party which had a great deal of support from all bishops of Włocławek. Polish Christian Democratic Party had also a lot of supporters in those days, the Party existed under this name until 1937, when it united with the National Worker’s Party forming Labour Party. You could say that the clergy were in favor of social solidarity, whose realization was a corporate system, which should be understood as an authentic socio-economic autonomy, created with the help of the country but the initiative itself came from society. An important external factor, which ordered priests to engage in political affairs, was the social radicalism among the urban and rural population. A peasant movement played a significant role here. The clergy relatively favorable referred to the polish parties such as “Piast” and “Stronnictwo Ludowe”. The priests worked for many organizations, associations, trade unions or school.

https://openalex.org/W4353027612,2023,Philosophy,"Vedantic Hinduism in Colonial Bengal. Reformed Hinduism and Western Protestantism. By Victor A. van BijlertTwo books that successively appeared in 2021 and have greatly held my interest are Ankur Barua’s The Brahma Samaj and its Vaishnava Milieus (Brill) and the work under review. They both represent intensive studies of the intellectual, cultural, and religious terrain of colonial Bengal through a creative fusion of the disciplines of history and religious studies. In this work, Bijlert’s thesis rests on two major arguments: First, that Vedanta constitutes the moral and intellectual backbone of reform Hinduism and second, that reform Hinduism also purposively reflects Christian Protestant forms of work and organisation. Prima facie, these are reasonable and convincing conclusions to offer. Rightly or wrongly, from Rammohun down to Radhakrishnan (with Tagore and Gandhi placed in between), Vedanta has come to be seen as the quintessential thought of India. But here also lies the catch. In effect, ‘Vedanta’ turns out to be only a somewhat convenient shorthand for a particular sub-school within Vedanta, that is, Advaita or non-dualist Vedanta, whereas in principle, it represents all sub-schools within Uttaramimamsa—which, between them, reveal significant doctrinal differences. Quite possibly, this obfuscating practice goes back to pre-modern India, but Rammohun arguably strengthened it in some ways. The Raja appears to have little knowledge of Vedantic thinkers other than Acharya Sankara and the dualist Madhva he unjustly denigrated by comparing him with Carvaka! To compound matters, Rammohun invariably refers to Upanishadic texts as ‘Vedas’. Herein lies a double confusion: First, the religious and philosophical conclusions of the Upanishads varied considerably from those of the Samhitas, Brahmanas and Aranyakas but more importantly, as would emerge from a perusal of Rammohun’s writings, he had simply no idea of these other textual components. Whereas his paramaguru, Sankara, had commented on as many as ten Upanishads, Rammohun chose to comment on only five, which, I suspect, was aimed at pushing specific theological or philosophical agendas, namely the rejection of image worship, polytheism, and sectarianism. Rammohun used religion rather instrumentally, investing it with certain uncharacteristic features like social utility. How else is one to explain his oft-quoted letter stating that religion ought to promote ‘political advantage and social comfort’.",en

It really is dangerous—the place is famous for it. There's a madhouse nearby, caves where criminals and the sick can hide out. Also, once upon a time, as they say in fairy tales, the great dragon Zmei Gorynich lived here beside the Puchai River. The stench in these places drives away the most committed misanthropes and even one type of philanthrope—that is, perverts. It sounds dumb, but the stench is cleansing. I don't know where it comes from. After the operating theaters and the rooms with amputees, the stench no longer repelled or attracted me; it just was. And this was a great place to think. As I walked, I considered an incident with our patient.The patient, a respectable individual whose name carries too much weight for me to state it directly, one day began to assault people. He nearly strangled a merchant who he believed asked too much for a beaver coat. He likewise wanted to kill his business partner when he didn't say hello loudly enough. But the worst was, he lost all shame of his own nakedness. At first it was the police who took care of it. When our future patient slipped off his pants and undergarments, he was taken to Kyrylivska, which has had means for dealing with such cases dating back to the day when unhinged Cossacks and composers from Kyiv Mohyla Academy were taken there.During the examination we determined that the patient was experiencing a severe breakdown. His wife added that lately, more than once, he had allowed himself strong words in front of the children and often suffered from ennui. Furthermore, she said, the patient had been undergoing treatment for “the French disease” for some years—which was, obviously, where we needed to start.“Syphilis!” Skorsky spat out the matchstick he was chewing on. He was a specialist on the psychological aspects of diseases related to the venereal. “Tertiary syphilis! When poorly treated, over time ‘the French disease’ can destroy the central nervous system. Hence the patient's chicanery. Such theater!”Skorsky and I had not spoken since the incident at Bilinsky's. Meanwhile, something significant had happened to him. The most boring person on earth, Skorsky had simply caught fire. He said hello and kibitzed. I even heard the doctor got drunk alone in his office, then wandered through the forest. Could he be using narcotic substances?“Cocaine!” was the doctor's second proclamation. It was his favorite treatment for the psychological complications of syphilis. Skorsky himself never took what he called “the universal drug”—good for alcoholism and toothaches, neuroses and morphine dependency—though he had read in an article by a respectable Viennese physician, who used cocaine as a panacea, that it was not addictive. That doctor subsequently recanted, but Skorsky paid no attention. He believed the retraction was made under pressure from pharmacologists who had no incentive to cease production of the medications that cocaine might supplant. Their representatives either paid or threatened the Viennese to repent.As the patient was escorted to his room, he assaulted the orderly, Alevtyna. They tried pulling him off her, but, though he released his fingers from her neck, he buried his teeth in her leg. The poor orderly, who had not until then been attacked by a psychotic, nearly died of fear. Later, panic set in over Skorsky's diagnosis. He told her about the consequences of syphilis: grotesque patterns on one's face due to infection of the skin, mucous membranes, cartilage, and bones. He went on about the devastation to the central nervous system, which they had just observed in real life: “The face starts to look like lace some mangy dogs fought over before rolling in the mud.”Alevtyna, who had not yet regained her faculty of speech, straightened up. Ignoring the slavering male orderlies, she bared her leg to get a better look at the wound. She then ran down the hall and out into the garden, where she fell on the ground to rip up grass and small bunches of daisies. Alevtyna ate them along with the soil in their roots.“Minor hysteria. She needs fifteen milligrams of cocaine.”Skorsky took a snuff box out of his pocket and scooped up some white powder with a toothpick made from a goose feather. He gave the order to close Alevtyna's mouth and one of her nostrils, forcing her to snort the medication.We fretted over her so long that evening fell. I decided to walk down, along the ravine, behind the church.It was unlikely there were any large beasts there, but something was rustling. The pits and mounds, ravines, paths, graves of witches whose living sisters flew in the treetops from time to time, the whispers of the forest spirits, the spirits of the nutcases who died in the hospital, the spirits of the monks from the St. Cyril Monastery, Zmei Gorynich and the bogatyrs who wanted to defeat him. The city would be calmer without this forest. I saw the gaps between the trees and went off in the direction of the tram tracks.As I was coming out of the forest, there was a patch of Amanita muscaria that had been trampled into porridge. A bit farther on, the body of Professor Bilinsky lay killed in the blackberry bushes. The way he was lying it looked as though he had not struggled before death. I quickly examined his body but saw nothing out of the ordinary. There were no wounds, no dirt under the fingernails. Animals had not yet smelled the carrion, but swarms of various insects covered him. Oh, why did I have to find the putrid body?The best thing would be to take the tram to his house to inform his relatives. The doors closed, and I noticed my own calm. This death had not evoked any emotions in me other than a feeling of responsibility, the need to tell the family. But also—some alarm at the thought of who the murderer could be. I knew that it was murder.“Your nose is bleeding.” A woman as round as an onion, carrying two baskets full of strawberries, offered me an ironed and starched handkerchief.“Have I dirtied my shirt?”“No, it's as neat as a pin. It's just your nose that's dirty. Wipe it now before you spray blood on my strawberries.”“No one will see the red on red.”“Ah, but it's salty!”“You know why it's not sweet? We'd drink it like syrup.”“Those with Christ in their heart do not talk that way.”“Are your strawberries expensive?”“Why? What?”“I'm checking to see if you have God in your heart.”“Child, if you knew how I have to work for this berry! I have to weed it a hundred times. In a week, the quitch grass grows as high as a horse. And I water it with water I carry from the stream, it kills my arms . . . ”“How much are the berries?”“They're not for sale. Anyway, soon money won't mean a thing. Soon all money, all these papers made from the skins of sinners on their satanic presses will be annulled. What matters is how we treat each other.”“So if I try your strawberries for free, my ‘thank you’ will be enough?”“Hands off!” she said and thwacked my fingers.I heard loud laughter behind me—same laughter as from the café near the Continental. There was no one sitting near Alina. (This is what fate looks like, remember.) Without asking, I sat next to her, away from the old lady.“Excuse me, but the night before last didn't you, yes, didn't you intrude on my privacy?” She started right away.“I saw it a little differently. Who was that young man with the mustache who paid me for you?”“Are you checking to see if you can flirt?”The tram stopped. People got on and off.“Are you coming back from the hospital?” she asked. “Don't be shocked. My uncle works there. He's told me all about you.”“An uncle by the name of Skorsky?”(Remember: this is what fate looks like.)“Yes. Skorsky's been strange recently—says things that make me wonder if he hasn't lost his mind. Have you noticed anything?”“I don't know.”“You know perfectly well.”“Where are you going?” I tried to change the subject.“I have to send something to my theater friends in Odesa. By the way, they'll be putting on Oedipus Rex soon in Kyiv—in Ukrainian.”“Greek tragedy in Ukrainian! That's a first.”“Exactly. The troupe is rehearsing now in Odesa. The theater where they will perform this fall is being remodeled.”“Wait. Now I remember where I've seen you before—it was at a performance! Vynnychenko's Black Panther and White Bear, at the Bergonier on Fundukleivska.“The same director is doing the Oedipus. He's my friend.”“He's your friend in what sense?”“Again with that tired subject. By the way, I've been thinking about you.”“And I about you.”“That's good. I was thinking not about you, to be precise, but about that elevator you invited me on.”“Who was that man with you?”“Like a broken record! Even if he had been my fiancé, I'm not bought or inherited. I'm not a brooch or a hundred acres of land, and I'm not a house in Kaniv! . . . Who was with you when you saw Black Panther?“Ah, so.”“Answer!”“That was my mother. She looks very young. She is coming to Kyiv the day after tomorrow. I can introduce you.”“Oh, this is my stop.”I looked out the window and realized that I had long since passed the stop for Bilinsky's.“Can we see each other again?”“We can. But you have only one chance.”Alina the anarchist wrote something on a scrap of paper and handed it to me.Morning, not morning but a thick porridge (I hate porridge). Dew, thick spit, crushed fruits, urine, all on the sparkling cobblestones. The sun, just barely having made its appearance, is already scorching. The human masses scurry and grumble like poorly digested food inside a stomach.I walked diagonally across St. Sofia's Square, then along the perimeter, then one edge, then again diagonally across. I went underground. The basement café of the Continental Hotel was practically empty. I again asked the server to bring the cloth with the embroidered portrait, but I couldn't remember the musician's last name, only that it ended with -sky. The server said that -sky was currently in the southern cities of Yalta and Odesa. I added that Kurbas, the director, Alina's friend, was also in Odesa, rehearsing Oedipus Rex, and that he'd previously put on Black Panther.I was bored, so I walked along Khreshchatyk and then headed down, calling to mind all the Kyiv churches of Podil: there's Birth of Christ, St. Nicholas on the Shore, Intercession, Pyrohoshcha, Holy Presentation, St. Dymytrii Rostovsky, St. Illia's. And also the Epiphany Brotherhood Monastery, Ascension Convent, and St. Katherine's, all these whipped-cream churches on the waffles of our streets. A few of them reminded me of themselves by appearing suddenly out of nowhere.The smells on Kontraktova Plaza where commerce buzzed were like multicolored light bulbs turning on one after another. Here you could catch the aroma of Balabukha jam, which blended with the next smell, English shoe polish at the Raiskys’ shop. Then the crunchy-smelling cabbage from old women standing in a row like herons and spitting out the shells of sunflower seeds. Farther on, the stench of a good-sized rat that crawled under Mrs. Shevchuk's shop where she sells broadcloth. Oh, she can't scream: no, she'll quietly dig that rat out herself so as to not scare off her clients.I bought a paper and two pairs of underwear. I asked two laughing young chambermaids who were secretly puffing in a grape-filled yard for a smoke. I wandered around Podil until evening when I came across a sawmill near the Dnipro that surprisingly smelled pleasantly of mazut fuel oil. The weather was dry, yet in the middle of the road was an enormous puddle, a deep dark black. A forty-year-old woman in a pale pink dress stood near it. The theatricality of it all provoked me to pose her a question,“Ma'am, what should I do?”But she paid me no attention. I shouted,“What should I do?”“What to do, what to do?” she said in Polish. “Jump in the water and swim so far away that you cannot return.”I quickly crossed a section of the forest. The wind brought a mixture of unpleasant air, like a stinky handkerchief held under one's nose. Passing the trees, I saw light in the spaces between them and exited at the hospital.Outside the windows, two orderlies lay in chairs with their heads thrown back. Two others—fools—ran around the yard in different directions, peering out at . . . something. The lights on the first floor of the hospital were on, and the staff milled about.“You're just in time!” said Ivan, a tall, young orderly.“For what?”“Your patient ran away! We went into his room and he wasn't there.”“What patient?”“The one who bit Alevtyna,” said Danylo, the other orderly, short and middle-aged.“That's Skorsky's patient, not mine.”I had no intention of helping them. This was all history—like my family, Kyiv, and my previous life. I had no intention of thinking about it. I wanted to go to my office, pack up my field surgery kit, and get out. So what? Their psychotic syphilitic ran away—it happened.Of course, that patient could have something to do with Bilinsky's murder. But that was no longer my problem.“What a strange coincidence!” the doctor on duty said. “Comrade doctor, the other one responsible for this patient was just here.”“And where is he now?”“He took off toward the church to look for the patient.”“Didn't the patient escape earlier?”“Don't know.”“How do you not know? You had better call the police, moron, before he kills someone. And get those sleeping orderlies to look for him.”“They can't . . . ”“Why not? Should I go wake them?”“They're on morphine.”“And you, I can see, have lost your mind. Go, catch your psycho! If it turns out that he killed Bilinsky—and on your watch—you can't imagine what's in store for you.”I adjusted my homburg and set off in the direction of St. Cyril's, that unwelcoming monolithic cube. I glanced around—what if our escaped syphilitic were to jump out of the bushes and bite or strangle me. I looked around because I wasn't sure of my actions, wasn't sure of my choices. Tripping over a clump of clover, I reached the open doors of the church. I couldn't stop myself from going in.The walls and ceiling were covered with frescoes. There was what used to be an angel rolling up the sky on the southern column of the narthex. But also graffiti: people scratched their names on it so as not to be forgotten—their idea of eternity. Prince Volodymyr the Great compared this activity to the desecration of graves. The vandals paid a fine and were beaten with canes. During the raids of Batu Khan, the church was deserted and cracks appeared all over it. Wild martens and feral dogs sought shelter here; insects swarmed under the ceiling with its red mosaics. Birches grew in its midst. Water seeped in the cracks, the water became ice, the ice widened the cracks, more water seeped in the cracks, becoming more ice that further widened the cracks, the wall split and nearly fell over, and then the wall fell over. Yet the angel is still rolling up the sky . . . When I reached the exit, I heard a rustling behind me. I turned after I stepped outside: in the depths of the church, like a stick in a pot of tar, stood a man with a large bag thrown over his shoulder and a revolver pointed right at me.“Is that you, Doctor?“Don't move!”“What's . . . Skorsky, what's with you?”“Don't move, I say!”“What are you doing here?”And finally I understood . . . Skorsky was himself the psycho! (Really, I had known for a while.)“You are the murderer! I knew it! But—why?”“Shut up.”“It was you. You! The stolen cigarettes, the strange behavior, Bilinsky. If I shout, everybody will come running. They've already called the police!”There was heavy breathing behind me. And then a gun rang out.The city is overgrown with new buildings. They encircle everything that was once on the periphery. Kyiv has become an old lady that can no longer restrain herself in the face of pastries. The city climbs farther. It steps over the swamps, turns the old rivers into a series of lakes; the other bodies of water it drives into canals. The grain that falls from the wild wheat is black. When the sun heats it, the grain melts and trickles into the earth. St. Cyril's stands indestructible. No one spackles the small cracks in its walls with either expensive putty or glues, nor with cheap cement and whitewash. One day a small fox appears in the doorway. It runs inside and along the floor of simple gray tiles. The gods watch from the walls, watch and fall into ruin. The fox runs to the iconostasis. Before it is a time-darkened Virgin Mother and Child in oil on sheets of zinc. The fox runs the metal steps that wind up to the second floor. The fox runs past all the vaults, naves, all the frescoes. A buckthorn seed flies in through a broken window. It will be the first. Soon the buckthorn will grow everywhere. A dumb hare will make its nest in the buckthorn bushes and nightingales will settle in the upper branches to sing until the end of the world. The fox runs between the thick rays that penetrate the windows. It catches one of the rays, squints its eyes, and warms itself in the sun.The shot rang out, but I did not fall. I looked around—and on the church threshold was our syphilis patient bearing a rod. His head lay on the rocks by the doorway.“If only he'd been at the stage of nose deformity! Just imagine: a hole instead of a nose plus a hole from the bullet—like an extra pair of eyes!” Skorsky laughed at the corpse.“We need to call the orderlies.”“They heard the shot. They'll run here on their own. You see, Professor Bilinsky believed it would take two or three years to wrap up this patient's case,” Skorsky told me. “But I took care of it much faster!”“Excuse me, but I'm going crazy in this city. I thought that you were Bilinsky's murderer.”“Just so. Why not? I am Bilinsky's murderer.”“Don't tease. You've changed a lot recently, so . . . ”“Yes, I've started killing people. You might term such a change significant.”“You have the right to irony.”“I am not being ironic.”“Let's call it sarcasm.”“It's the honest-to-God truth.”“And yes, you have the right to mock me.”“Well then, let's be done. To the horses!”“What horses?”“Alina's waiting!”Alina, her uncle Skorsky, a few others I didn't know, and I rode like the wind that ripped off my homburg and carried it back to Kyiv.“There's a fresco in the choir loft at St. Cyril's where Vrubel painted himself and patients from the hospital as the apostles. When I came across it by accident, I really believed they were saints,” Alina said.“I've never been up there. I've only seen the church from below.”“Remember the way back so you can see it sometime.”“The Puchai River used to flow here. You shouldn't trust the landscape,” Skorsky said, reaching for something, perhaps his bag, just when we left the darkness of the trees and saw the endless steppe ahead of us.We rode all night without stopping. Though no one was chasing us. Though we had nowhere to be. We rode like beasts released from a cage. The promises of the horizon turned what we'd left behind into a cage fit for those from whom freedom had been severed, like an anomaly, at birth.The pre-morning sky looked at first like a sack of turnips—filled with something heavy. But with each verst, the sky became lighter. When it was finally light enough to see clearly, we arrived at a knoll at the foot of a stone wall that from a distance had appeared to be a gigantic piece of halva. The exterior ruins of the castle gave no hint of how it was when all was fine here, when people defended themselves successfully from the nomads’ raids. From far off, the wreckage looked like a natural agglomeration of stones—a rocky elevation, no more: a cluster of cliffs. It would rain a few hundred more times, a few hundred more winds from a few hundred directions would blow on this heap, and it would collapse as though nothing had ever been here.A few stalks of wheat grew from one of the rocks. Someone had probably cast a handful of grain here for some birds that forgot to eat it.“Who could this castle belong to?” I asked Skorsky.“I reckon the Swan Princess,” the doctor rejoined, hoping to sound knowledgeable.From behind one of the piles of gray sandstone emerged a young man in a black reptilian coat and a white papakha as lush, bright, and out of place as a dahlia. His name was Artem. The heat was melting our brains, but he was dressed like that, in rooster fashion, which was popular among the otamans. Artem helped Alina dismount her horse and tried to kiss her on the lips, but she offered him a cheek instead.Had she been racing to see this clown?We entered the yard—the ruins had fashioned an internal space that was more or less protected, at least from strangers’ eyes. It turned out that there were even places where it was possible to hide from the rain, and from there the ruins didn't look half bad.In the center of the court was a table, and on it a wooden bucket with pink gladiolas. How romantic! It all looked like it came from outer space. Where on earth, in the middle of the steppe, far from any village or town, did this table, this simple table, come from? And the gladiolas? The steppe hadn't been plowed in so long that any cultivars would have gone wild, degenerated, dried up completely.A campfire crackled nearby—a little preview of what we would soon do to the houses, villages, and cities. Artem the otaman brought over a cezve from the fire and poured the first portion into a small, copper cup for Alina. He also got out a porcelain cup with images of rosy cherubim—but how . . . ?“Who else would like coffee?”Only Skorsky and I responded. The question excited me, even distracted me from the thought of the kiss I had recently witnessed and the Kyiv I had recently left.“It's obvious who the professors here are; cultured people drink coffee. Are you both doctors?”“Uh-huh.”“For wolves of the steppe, like us, doctors are gold, even more precious than gold. Actually, a Hippocrates like you should eat more, because those in your profession will soon be worth your weight in gold. Work on your figures, both of you.”“Who will take pity on the horses that have to carry us?”“We'll find the horses. And very large doctors can be transported on machine-gun carts. We'll need to seat the otamans near you. Only a fool would shoot at a doctor.”“I think we'll find quite enough fools here.”“With your beard, Doctor, you look like Tsar Nicholas II. But even so you won't be shot. You might even be canonized!”“We've only just arrived and you're going on about executions,” Skorsky grumbled and checked to make sure that he still had his bag.“Apologies, apologies, pardonnez-moi. But you are not merely a doctor. A venereologist! Skorsky, you're a specialist! A venereologist is the most important person in wartime. The most valuable! You are the botanists of war. You can't imagine what varieties of flowers grow here, and these beds have long awaited a proper gardener. Or even just a man with a scythe!”“Bite your tongue,” Alina said. “I don't need to listen to this.”“Yes, yes, of course. Excuse me, my r—. ” He almost said “rose.”We rested all day. We went down to a surprisingly close river overgrown with lilies. We rowed the boats left by fishermen. I talked to Skorsky. He took his bag everywhere, refusing even to swim so he wouldn't have to part with it. I asked him what he had in it, but he said it wasn't my damned business.Alina rowed with the otaman to the middle of the river. They were having a loud discussion. She was waving her hands. The current carried their boat downstream slowly and smoothly. What a nuisance, that current!I tried to meet with Alina one-on-one, but she was avoiding me. In the morning I was confused, by lunch I was sad, and after lunch I got angry.In the evening, I lay on the hot grass and drank another cup (I have no idea where they got such good coffee), which had no effect at all on my sleep. I watched the Perseids. Every year, the Earth passes through the tail of Comet Swift-Tuttle. People can see the meteor shower and make a wish. I wished. I counted forty-seven falling stars. All forty-seven of my wishes were for the same thing.Around the campfire, they were sitting, talking. I saw how he tickled her face with a piece of grass and she brushed him off in annoyance. Then they were screaming at each other. Later they again spoke kindly, after which they again quarreled. My joy grew after each tiny mistake that Artem made. I wanted him to show the worst he was capable of.They were screaming at each other, but all I could hear was beautiful opera singing. The stars fell to the sound of their screaming. The stars blessed my joy.Then this happened: Alina kicked the fire, scattered burnt kindling, and burned some of the grass. Artem grabbed her by the arm, but she broke away from him and ran off to the horses.“Go then! I guarantee you'll get to Katerynoslav and return with your tail between your legs.”“I'm going to Huliai-Pole! To Father Makhno!”I jumped up and ran after her.“Where do you think you're going?” Artem shouted.Really—where was I going? I was going after her: to Huliai-Pole, to Katerynoslav, to Rome, to Washington, to Istanbul, to Montevideo . . . “Go to sleep,” he said. “Come morning, this coquette will be here, right as rain. We've already been through this show. Tomorrow she'll be right here next to my boot!”. . . No, she won't.In some sort of shape we entered some town. There were some buildings that were some colors, some trees, some streets, some roads, and some signs. Posts, flustered birds’ nests, echoes, colors, shapes—each of some kind. A wedding procession was coming toward us. If you want to make orange, you need to add yellow to red, and then bam—it's black. If you want to salt the soup, shake in a little, and then bam—two handfuls. You want to say a kind word, and then bam—a punch in the face. I was rocked around like a watermelon on a boat and threw up my breakfast straight into the horse's fluffy mane. Sanko found this hilarious, but I said I'd pulverize him. So Sanko sped ahead.No one knew anything about Alina. The daytime sky was like a poorly washed bowl. The sun was a squashed, rotten apricot. The night sky looked like the sole of a boot to me. The moon was a dirty cheap copper coin that had gotten stuck to the sole. Everything seemed spoiled to me, irrelevant, unnecessary. Without her, this journey was a waste of time.“You'd better stay away from everyone,” Artem said. “You'll infect us with your pining, and pining is worse than the clap.”The wedding procession was before us. The young couple, still utter children, walked so calmly it was as if they didn't see us. As if we were made of a light breeze—our bodies, clothes, our horses and their iron shoes—of the lightest gasses. As if we were visible only to ourselves and the coal-black dog that barked, panting and gasping.The wedding was headed straight for us. We were in the middle of the road, and so were they. We approached each other slowly, a wave going toward a wave. Some ten meters before their indifferent faces, I noticed the color of the bride's eyes. And the coral-colored tulips that fell on the road before her. Round goose eggs on meaty stems, the flowers were falling and falling before her. The bride's eyes were almond shaped.“Hey there,” Artem shouted at me. “Wake up!”I came to and saw the whole village, everyone there, not realizing my group had turned left onto a side street away from the procession. The tulips disappeared—where'd they get tulips in the fall? I was sitting alone on my horse in the middle of the road, and the entire wedding procession came to a stop. I moved to the side, and the throng marched on, cutting off our escape route. We rode a few more meters and came across the synagogue.“You know what, you're right,” said the otaman.“Who is?”“Oleksii is the only one here who's right.”“About what?”Artem turned his horse and raced back. Everyone stood still while he ran his horse into the crowd and began firing his revolver. People scattered in all directions. Artem trotted, cackling like an imbecile. The horse kicked an old guy in the mouth. The man fell, spitting out h",en
https://openalex.org/W4365513689,2023,Philosophy,"The doctrine of participation in Augustine's <i>totus Christus</i> ecclesiologyAbstract Augustine's understanding of the church as part of the totus Christus – the ‘whole Christ’ – has become an important resource in contemporary theology, offering a robust vision of the church's union with God. Yet a key critique maintains that it threatens to elide the distinction between the perfected Christ and the created church. This article addresses this issue by asking how the totus Christus doctrine relates to the doctrine of participation. For Augustine, participation is a metaphysical category that expresses the creature's dependent, non-divine status, its essential being out of nothing. The totus Christus doctrine is most explicitly an exegetical, not metaphysical doctrine. Nevertheless, by putting these two facets of Augustine's thought together, we can see the way in which they mutually reinforce the view that the astonishing claims of unity in the totus Christus are structured by a larger theological grammar that distinguishes God and creature.",en
https://openalex.org/W4309280985,2023,Philosophy,"Dispositif thérapeutique et de recherche en psychodrameL’article s’inscrit dans une réflexion d’ensemble concernant le psychodrame psychanalytique, dans une dynamique d’évaluation de ses effets, de ses processus psychothérapiques et prolonge ce qui a pu déjà être écrit en la matière. L’angle d’approche ici adopté concerne les contenus et l’articulation entre, d’une part, le déroulé même des séances, et de l’autre, les temps d’élaboration dont elles font l’objet en équipe et en dehors de ces dernières. La méthodologie adoptée s’appuie sur une description contemporaine et globale des grands enjeux de la technique, différenciant son cadre analytique de ses différentes déclinaisons en termes de dispositifs, selon l’institution, ou les patients accueillis, afin d’en faciliter la compréhension et la saisie de ses effets pour le lecteur. En s’appuyant sur une revue de la littérature actualisée et prenant en compte les travaux actuels en termes d’évaluation et de pratiques, nous nous appuyons sur plusieurs concepts clés, comme le travail de co-construction, d’élaboration groupale des enjeux transférentiels, le déploiement des processus de symbolisation et du jeu transitionnel à proprement parler. Il apparaît que le travail de co-construction en séance, entre les thérapeutes et le/les patients, et celui permis par l’intervision et la supervision en dehors des temps de jeu, s’inscrivent dans une dialectique interactive, fonctionnant en boucle et à la façon d’emboîtements réciproques, produisant des effets de changements potentiellement thérapeutiques pour les patients. Ces effets sont visibles et observables autant dans le contenu même des jeux et des échanges avec les patients, que dans les liens de ces derniers avec leur entourage. L’investissement du dispositif par les thérapeutes les sollicite pendant et hors de la séance, individuellement et groupalement, les amenant à engager un travail complexe, pluridimensionnel, prenant des formes variées mais complémentaires. Analyser ce qui se joue, consciemment et inconsciemment, pendant ces différents temps et espaces permet ici de favoriser la compréhension de leurs liens, mais aussi de soutenir ces processus de co-construction de la vie psychique et des processus de symbolisation. Mettant au travail psychanalytiquement les co-thérapeutes dans leur positionnement, vécus et élaborations, la pratique du psychodrame apparaît du coup aussi comme possédant une visée didactique et formative. Les propositions avancées dans l’article permettent une meilleure compréhension des processus thérapeutiques que soutient le psychodrame psychanalytique, en montrant comment le travail groupal engagé par les thérapeutes s’effectue bien à plusieurs niveaux et dans plusieurs espaces, complexifiant la compréhension habituelle de ces enjeux. Elles invitent à poursuivre la recherche concernant ce type de dispositif mettant en avant tant les questions groupales que la place donnée au jeu. Nous soutenons la mise en place de ces dispositifs dans les institutions psychiatriques et médico-sociales prenant en charge des patients complexes, pour lesquels les prises en charge plus classiques ne sont ni toujours indiquées, ni efficientes pour traiter des symptomatologiques difficiles, inscrites dans les agirs, le refus de l’élaboration, voire de l’échange. This article is part of a general reflection on psychoanalytical psychodrama, and of a dynamic evaluation of its effects and psychotherapeutic processes, and builds upon what has already been written on the subject. The angle of approach adopted here concerns the contents and the articulation between, on the one hand, the sessions themselves and, on the other hand, the team's reflection on the clinical material outside of the sessions themselves. The methodology adopted is based on a contemporary and global description of the major stakes of the technique, differentiating its analytical framework from its different variations in terms of setting (according to the institution or the patients received), in order to facilitate the understanding and the grasp of its effects for the reader. Based on an updated literature review and taking into account current research on evaluation and practices, we rely on several key concepts, such as the work of co-construction, group elaboration of transferential issues, the deployment of symbolization processes, and transitional play itself. It appears that the work of co-construction during the session, between the therapists and the patient(s), and the work undertaken in intervision and supervision outside of the sessions, are part of an interactive dialectic, functioning in a loop, reciprocally interlocking, and producing effects of potentially therapeutic changes for our patients. These effects are visible and observable both in the content of the psychodrama and the exchanges with the patients, and in the exchanges with the patients and their families, both in and out of the sessions. The investment of the setting by the therapists solicits them during and outside the session, individually and as a group, leading them to engage in a complex, multidimensional work, taking various but complementary forms. Analyzing what is played out, consciously and unconsciously, during these different times and spaces, allows us to promote the understanding of their links, and, moreover, to support these processes of co-construction of psychic life and symbolization processes. Thus, by putting the co-therapists to work – psychoanalytically speaking – regarding their positioning, experiences and elaborations, the practice of psychodrama also has a didactic and formative aim. The proposals put forward in the article allow for a better understanding of the therapeutic processes that psychoanalytic psychodrama supports, by showing how the group work engaged in by the therapists is indeed carried out on several levels and in several spaces, making the usual understanding of these issues more complex. They invite us to pursue research concerning this type of therapy, highlighting both the group issues and the place afforded to play. We promote the use of psychodrama in our psychiatric and medico-social institutions that serve complex patients, for whom the more classic treatments are not always indicated nor efficient in treating difficult symptomatology, and who often refuse elaboration, or even exchange.",en

https://openalex.org/W4385892045,2023,Philosophy,"Exploring the Science of Marma - An Ancient Healing Technique: Marma TherapyMarma Science, an extraordinary gem in the vast treasure of Ayurvedic knowledge, represents the science of specific vital places in the body (Marmas), that are the ‘seats of life’ (Prana - the vital life force). As any injury to these parts may lead to severe pain, disability, loss of function, loss of sensation, or death, therefore, they hold an important place in the science of surgery. The ancient scriptures have strictly prohibited causing any injury to the Marmas. However, recent researches have used Marma stimulation for theraputic benefits, with encouraging outcomes. Looking at these mutually conflicting, important applications of Marma Science, the present study was undertaken for its in-depth analysis. Previously, we have explored different aspects of Marma Science in ancient and classical Indian scriptures. In addition, our other study have provided detailed description of the number of Marmas, their location, structures involved, classification, effect of trauma, etc., as per classical texts, as well as correlation with modern science. Previously, we also published its use in Yoga and other ancient Indian traditions, both as a therapeutic technique, as well as for self-defense and inflicting injury on the opponents. The present article explored its application as a therapeutic procedure (Marma Therapy). Different methods of Marma stimulation have been compiled. Therapeutic classification and applications of Marmas have been listed, and several research studies on Marma Therapy have been presented. Several mechanisms for the mode of action of Marma Therapy have been discussed. It is concluded that Marma Science holds significant promise as an effective therapeutic procedure.",en

https://openalex.org/W4362697318,2023,Philosophy,"Guest Editor’s Introduction: The Time of Africana PhilosophyAfricana philosophy is in the main a philosophy of the present. Many will demur and with good reason. In the first place, in worrying about the definition and animating energies of Africana philosophers, Africana philosophers have looked to the past to furnish answers to the former, and to the future to motivate its orientation to the latter. For Lucius Outlaw, for example, writing in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, “Africana philosophy is a third-order, metaphilosophical, umbrella-concept used to bring organizing oversight to various efforts of philosophizing—that is, activities of reflective, critical thinking and articulation and aesthetic expression—engaged in by persons and peoples African and of African descent who were and are indigenous residents of continental Africa and residents of the many African Diasporas worldwide” (2017, first paragraph).If, then, on the one hand, Outlaw’s definition points to the past to make intelligible the contours of Africana philosophy—“persons and peoples . . . of African descent”—it is to the end of mobilizing toward the future. “In all cases,” he argues, “the point of much of [Africana] philosophizings has been to confer meaningful orderings on individual and shared living and on natural and social worlds while resolving recurrent, emergent, and radically disruptive challenges to existence so as to survive, endure, and flourish across successive generations.” It is striking, for all that, though, that he makes sure to insist on Africana philosophizing, the verb, rather than philosophy, the noun. For Outlaw, “the name [Africana philosophy] does not refer to a particular philosophy, philosophical system, method, or tradition” (2017). Rather, it is primarily a philosophizing, a doing. Where, then, the past and the future are invoked to give Africana philosophy its shape and contours, the doing of Africana philosophy—practices of the moment, of the present—are revealed to be its constitutive marrow.In the history of Africana philosophy few encounters clarify its present stakes as much as the bitter debate that erupted in post-independence African philosophy over whether there could be said to be an African philosophy. For the protagonists and other commentators, those debates seemed overwhelmingly to be fights about the past—specifically, over the existence of African philosophy in the precolonial past. Those who came to be identified as ethnophilosophers held that worldviews of precolonial African societies constituted coherent systems of thought worthy of the name “philosophy.” They were vehemently opposed by those who insisted on a universalist standpoint, led by the redoubtable Beninois Paulin Hountondji. These philosophers argued that those bent on the task of recuperating traditional worldviews were doing anthropology, not philosophy.At first glance, then, it would seem that these debates have little to tell us about the present of African philosophy. Indeed, there is overwhelming weariness among African philosophers regarding the pitched and factionalized disputations that tore through the discipline in the immediate post-independence era. And yet the view that these debates are now passé, relics and distractions from an immature era of a fledgling discipline, cannot account for their stakes; why precisely they were so rancorous, and why, even today, they occasion simmering tensions and embittered eruptions among African philosophers. Ethnophilosophers, after all, were not intent on recuperating the epistemes of traditional African societies out of sheer curiosity. Rather, they were intervening in deeply contested sociopolitical cleavages of their time.Alexis Kagame, for example, is renowned within the field of African philosophy as one of the most prominent ethnophilosophers to have emerged in the mid-twentieth century. His explication of the ontology of the Bantu, as revealed in Bantu languages, ought to be seen as all of a piece with his position as the central court historian and political theorist of the Kingdom of Rwanda. As historian Claudine Vidal (1991) established, Kagame’s influential scholarship had as one of its primary goals the justification of a constitutional monarchy. Indeed, half a century after his writings, Rwandese leaders who came to power in the wake of the 1990s genocide would seize on his portrayal of precolonial Rwanda as a pastoral social formation and his testimony to the existence of a Greater Rwanda in justifying their political and irredentist ambitions (Pottier 2002).Where the ethnophilosophers claimed the past, the universalists claimed the future. In his widely influential book, African Philosophy: Myth and Reality, Hountondji makes this explicit: “The theoretical liberation of philosophical discourse presupposes political liberation. We are today at the center of a tangle of problems. The need for a political struggle makes itself felt at all levels, on all planes. I shall simply add that this struggle will not be simple and that clarity as well as resolve are needed if we are to succeed. The future is at stake” (1983, 46). But just as with his ethnophilosophical antagonists—though now pitching camp in the antipodes of the future—the real temporal locus of Hountondji’s most concentrated anxieties are very much forged in the crucible of the present.It is striking, then, that though the present suffuses and saturates the ideas, relationships, and contours of Africana philosophy, the overwhelming registers of the field, its idioms and grounding metaphors, turn on past and future states. The reasons why are worth exploring. A potential response may be in the recognition that for Africana philosophers, “the present” has never been immediately available for naïve forms of apprehension. As German anthropologist Johannes Fabian famously articulated, the peoples of the non-Western worlds that were for long the primary objects of study in anthropology were denied “coevalness”—a recognition that they shared space and time with Westerners. For Fabian this reveals an acute antinomy in anthropological practice: “On the one hand we dogmatically insist that anthropology rests on ethnographic research involving personal, prolonged interaction with the Other. But then we pronounce upon the knowledge gained from such research a discourse, which construes the Other in terms of distance, spatial and temporal” (2003, xli). He describes as allochronism accounts of space and time in which the (Western) anthropologist believes themselves to be living in the here and now and their (non-Western) subject to be living in the there and then (32).Fabian conceives of allochronism as significantly an epistemological construction, but even from within the terms of his book, those epistemological forms are revealed to be deeply rhetorical ones. The denial of coevalness, Fabian points out, “rests on the negation of the temporal materiality of communication through language. For the temporality of speaking . . . implies cotemporality of producer and product, speaker and listener, Self and Other” (2003, 164). The practical manifestations of this phenomenon are everywhere present across disciplines. Africans and Afro-diasporic people are discovered, not discoverers. They are, to draw from the great Africana thinker W. E. B. Du Bois, not those who investigate problems but the problem (1903).As any close reader will notice, Fabian’s cri de coeur for the acknowledgment of non-Western alterity reiterates the motif of the West and the non-Western as spatially differentiated substances existing “externally” in relation to one another. Significantly, Fabian diagnoses allochronism largely in representational and phenomenological terms. “The Other’s empirical presence turns into his theoretical absence, a conjuring trick which is worked with an array of devices that have the common intent and function to keep the Other outside the time of anthropology,” he argues (2003, xli). It is no wonder then that when he moves beyond diagnosis and ventures prescriptions, he sees a path forward in the epistemological refurbishment of anthropology: “Ultimately, anthropology’s task is to give presence to those who, if at all, are spoken of only in absentia” (175).One immediate limitation of Fabian’s approach is the way it foregrounds an epistemic answer to a deeply historical-structural relation. Moreover, it largely conceives of presence and absence in a psychologistic register, that is, as phenomenological and empirical states of affairs enacted in the theaters of the mind. A radical alternative is, however, available. This would register the problem space of Africana philosophy within a historically materialist and phantasmatic terrain, bound up in the first and last instance to the intermeshed historical dynamics of capitalist value-form, white supremacist and anti-Black conjunctures, and hetero-patriarchal libidinal economies. As Toni Morrison (2007) has written, in an argument whose immediate context is literature but one that carries across disciplines from philosophy to the social sciences, the totemic values of the North Atlantic world—“individualism, masculinity, social engagement versus historical isolation; acute and ambiguous moral problematics; the thematics of innocence coupled with an obsession with figurations of death and hell”—are “responses to a dark, abiding, signing Africanist presence.”Fabian is testimony, then, to the notion that even those who would venture a claim to African presence, to their sheer existence in the here and now, are apt to shrink from their, from our, actually existing insistences on life and imagination. Even as Fabian imagines that coevalness will issue in ideal communicative encounter between the Western researcher and the (African) Other, he can barely get himself to countenance its spectral, radical upshot: “I am still nowhere near to understanding all the implications of this nor do I know how to resolve the quandary that such an ambition puts us into: if we were to succeed in making others present would that not put us out of business as their representers / representatives?” (2003, 175). The answer that he cannot abide is already given in the vehement disavowal contained by his question. To acknowledge the radicalism of Africana philosophy as a philosophy of the present is, in other words, to name what makes that present impossible, and ipso facto, what must be abolished to make it possible. That, ineluctably, is the abolition of the West as such. For “the West,” we ought always to be reminded, “is not in the West. It is a project, not a place” (Glissant 1989, 2). That project is racial capitalism, a world historical formation of planetary plunder, patriarchal and heteronormative domination, eugenicist and ableist violence, and more, litanies of quotidian and punctual atrocity. At stake, then, in making a claim to the present is the here and now of planetary abolition, which is to say, of revolution.The articles in this special issue tarry in the material and spectral upshot of abolition. As befitting a journal dedicated to the interanimation of the philosophical and the rhetorical, these articles traverse the fraught terrain of form and content, argument and image, language and silence, text and sound.Alena Rettová’s “The Genres of Swahili Philosophy” questions the notion that only nonfictional prose counts as philosophy. The dominance of this idea in African philosophy, she argues, has cut off the field “from its cultures of origin, their networks of circulation, and local audiences.” For Rettová, a more promising route for African philosophy ought to consist in taking seriously the diversity and richness of genres and languages constitutive of actually existing African cultures. Rettová then conducts a brilliant close reading of proverbs, musical performances, metric and free-verse poetry, novelistic prose, and translations. In excavating the philosophical insights of these genres, she demonstrates the ineliminable mediations of language and genre to any robust engagement with a philosophical tradition.Bryan Mukandi’s “Pan-African Pandemonium: Identities, Histories and Constellations” offers a searching examination of how we ought to imagine pan-African subjectivity against the background of the sociohistorical ruptures of slavery, colonialism, and postcolonial authoritarianism. Pushing against the “ontological exceptionalism” advanced in such disparate theoretical forms as Senghorian Negritude and Afropessimism, Mukandi instead listens to the dissonances between African and Afro-diasporic musical forms. But where others only find pandemonium in the reverberations between continental Africa and its diaspora, Mukandi finds flows and confluence. Ultimately, Mukandi seeks to make a space for a diasporic sensibility that “traverses the aesthetic, the ethical and the political.”The third article, “Watery Hauntings: A Glossary for African Philosophy in a Different Key,” by Louise du Toit and Azille Coetzee, reads the epistemic erasures, foreclosures, and violences reinscribed by African philosophy’s desire for recognition as “Philosophy,” tout court. Where canonical philosophy disavows the material, the particular, and the embodied, du Toit and Coetzee invite a turn to philosophizing and theorizing precisely attuned to these discarded forms. They find it in Black African women’s creative work, which they argue opens up a creative glossary for thought in a different key.Amir Jaima’s “To Make a Scholar Black: A Constructive Analysis of the Discursive Orientation Toward Blackness” examines the rhetorical forms of Black texts as these take shape in relation to their orientation to whiteness and Blackness. Jaima argues that a discursive orientation toward Blackness expands the range and rigor of Black texts. Specifically, in being oriented toward Blackness, the Black text makes conspicuous its discursive features, foregrounds its nonwhite narratee, and articulates the personal stakes of analyses.Finally, Omedi Ochieng’s “After Philosophy, Black Thought: Sylvia Wynter and the Ends of Knowledge” invites critical inquiry into the rhetorical form of Sylvia Wynter’s thought. Wynter’s thought, he argues, charts a cartography that is intransigently committed to a vision of the intellectual imagination at its most ambitious while staying true to the grain and detail of the liminal, the minoritized, and the particular. The upshot for Ochieng is that Wynter wants to open up a space for the work and labor of Black thought, one that comes after and beyond philosophy and theory.If the time of Africana philosophy is that of the present, then such a volume necessarily refuses to offer itself as a definitive, totalizing account of Africana philosophy. Rather, it strives to be improvisatory, provisional, and experimental. Precisely so, its stakes have never been more urgent, more vital—to strive to enact a practice that is nothing less, also nothing more, than a praxis committed to a radical abolitionist horizon, ecological, political, ethical, aesthetic, and existential.",en

In so doing, it deploys a familiar epistemological distinction between what is known by the senses and what is known by the mind. This turns out to be a risky strategy, however, leading to inadvertent skepticism with only diffuse and contrary ethical implications. Vasubandhu’s more explicitly metaphysical atomism, by contrast, relies on a different principle to get to its results, and aims to address different concerns. It leaves us with a view that positively implies a concrete mode of practical engagement, and resources for a critical stance. Even if certain atoms end up proven incoherent, there is no danger of slipping into the morally fatal indifference of inadvertent skepticism. For the ethical implications, it matters how one arrives at one’s atomism.KEYWORDS: AtomismDemocritusVasubandhuBuddhistskepticism AcknowledgementsI would like to thank Ugo Zilioni, whose invitation to participate in a conference on atomism first prompted this work; and also the conference participants themselves, particularly David Sedley, whose contributions offered a valuable perspective on Democritus and Vasubandhu.

A8, 325a30–31 (KRS 545) – though reports differ (for discussion see KRS, pp. 415–6).6 In Metaphysics Α4, 985b14–15, Aristotle says that the “differences [between the atoms] are three – shape, arrangement and position” (KRS 555), though shape may be expected to take size within its compass; Simplicius, for instance, reports that the atoms “have all sorts of forms and shapes and differences in size” (de caelo 295, KRS 556, DK 68A37).7 Aristotle, Metaphysics A4, 985b7 “full and solid”; “indivisible and impassive”, according to Simplicius de caelo 242.18 (KRS 557, DK 67A14)8 Simplicius de caelo 242.21 (KRS 584, DK 67A14); or as Aristotle has it, atoms colliding and associating “are the causes of other things” (Metaphy. Α4, 985b13).9 See also Aristotle's account in de gen. et corr. A8, “from what is truly one no plurality could come into being, nor a unity from what is truly a plurality - that is impossible” (KRS 545); and in de caelo “the many does not come from one nor one from many” (KRS 479).10 On the authority of Aristotle, de gen. et corr. A8, 325a2. Kirk, Raven, and Schofield comment that “Leucippus was generally agreed to have evolved his theory of atoms in answer to the Eleatic elenchus” (KRS, p. 403); “Leucippus or Melitus had associated with Parmenides in philosophy” (KRS 539). This is not to say that Protagorean subjectivism had no influence on Democritus’ development of his position (see below), as discussed for instance by Mi-Kyoung Lee in Epistemology after Protagoras. On Eleatic monism see note 12, below.11 KRS comment (p. 408), “The atomists rejected Zeno’s attempt to show that the members of a plurality are infinitely divisible, and therefore subject to absurd consequences”.12 While Simplicius credits Parmenides with the view that reality is monoeides and indivisible (Simpl., in Phys. 145.1–146.25, DK28B8), strong monism may in fact be more Melissan than Parmenidean (so Barnes, 204–7), and Zeno is especially associated with paradoxes arising from plurality. However, Plato strongly associates this notion with Parmenides in his dialogue by that name, and the tradition since Aristotle associated Parmenides with the rejection of plurality on the basis that reality is one (Aristotle, Metaphysics 986b29).13 KRS comment (p. 408), “It is curiously hard to find a text which explicitly calls the atoms uncreated and imperishable, although this is implied by the frequent description of atoms and void as elements and principles, e.g. 555”.14 νόμῳ γάρ φησι γλυκὺ καὶ νόμῳ πικρόν, νόμῳ θϵρμόν, νόμῳ ψυχρόν, νόμῳ χροιή´ ἐτϵῇ δὲ ἄτομα καὶ κϵνόν. See also DK 68A49 and DK68B125. Barnes prefers Plutarch’s version in adv. Col.1110Ε, which adds the generality “and every combination (sunkrisin)”. This may make the difference as to whether we read Democritus as a reductionist, or as an eliminativist (as argued by Eleni Kechagia in Plutarch Against Colates, Chapter 6).15 Sedley’s argument on this point, in “Why Aren’t Atoms Coloured?”, is persuasive.16 Sedley (“Why Aren’t Atoms Coloured?”, 68–69) finds such evidence in Galen, although he judges the tradition’s association of nomisti with the verbal root to have been mistaken.17 Adv. Math. VII.139; Sextus carries on, “Then, by way of judging [προκρίνων] the genuine one superior to [ἐπιφέρϵι] the bastard one, he adds these words: ‘when the bastard one is no longer able either to see in the direction of greater smallness, nor to hear or smell or taste or sense by touch other things in the direction of greater fineness’” (translation by Sedley in “The Atomist Criteria of Truth”).18 Judging in Republic V is more obscure (σκοτωδέστϵρον, 478c, 479c) compared to the clarity of knowing, and in Republic VI pertains to sensibles (ὁρατόν, 509d4; see also 510b4–5, 510d6–511a2, 511a8–10) as opposed to the intelligible (νοητόν, 509d4; τὸ γνωστόν, 510a9).19 Notice how Republic V, a locus classicus for Plato’s distinction between superior and inferior cognition, describes inferior cognitions as being of “the many nomina of the many”, (τὰ τῶν πολλῶν πολλὰ νόμιμα, Rep. 479d2–3). Burnyeat writes, “there is plenty of evidence that Democritean Atomism was based on a priori reasoning, not on observation” citing “clear evidence that his epistemology had a thoroughly rationalist character” (“‘All the World’s a Stage-Painting’”, 66).20 DKB207, tr. James Warren, with apt discussion, in Democritean Ethics, 48–51. DK68B74 similarly distinguishes pleasantness from benefit.21 Consider further DK 68B264 for Socratic sentiments about shame before oneself; and DK 68B252 for Platonic (and very unEpicurean) views about the importance and priority of civic responsibilities. Vlastos recognises these Socratic-Platonic elements of Democritus’ ethics, in “Ethics and Physics in Democritus”; and although he insists that “the contrast [of Democritus] with Socrates and Plato remains unbridgeable” (582), he concludes by observing that “Sextus’ association of the materialist Democritus with the idealist, Plato, in opposition to Protagorean phenomenoalism is profoundly true” (592). As we shall see below, however, it is not so easy for Democritus to avoid the pull towards Protagoreanism, just inasmuch as the contrast with Platonic metaphysics and epistemology remains unbridgeable.22 James Warren’s Epicurus and Democritean Ethics (Chapter 2, passim, esp. p. 72) is especially wise in its discussion of how many contrary positions might be legitimately supported by plausible interpretations of Democritus’ ethical remarks. Retrospectively pinning a specific ethical view definitively onto Democritus is made still more difficult by the uncertainty over exactly which of the surviving ‘Democritean’ texts are indeed by Democritus.23 Plato acknowledges a version of this worry in the Parmenides’ knowledge paradox, the separation argument which purports to show that sensibles and intelligibles can have no bearing on one another (Parm. 13a–135c), discussed in my “Separation Anxieties”; see also Sandra Peterson, “The Greatest Difficulty”. As Burnyeat observes, “Democritus does not think that appearances give us a sight or grasp (katalēpsis) of things unseen … the senses do not lead you on, there is no such thing as seeing the four columns as implying more of the same sort” (“‘All the World’s a Stage-Painting’”, 67).24 David Sedley has argued that Democritus’ presumed authority and distrust of the senses need not be contradictory – but it would leave him a skeptic of an empiricist sort. As Sedley puts it, “Democritus could quite consistently hold both that the senses do indeed command the evidence available to the mind, and that we know nothing for certain, because the senses are themselves unreliable” (“Atomist Criterion of Truth”, 38). Sedley credits Myles Burnyeat with the observation that the two assertions can be consistent.25 “We neither perceive ‘real reality’ (atoms and void), nor even macroscopic objects and their properties (for example, a square tower),” writes Katja Vogt (“Ancient Skepticism”). “Democritus seems to have argued along these lines (SE M 7.135–9; cf. fr. 9, SE M 7.136; Theophrastus, De Sensibus 2.60–1, 63–4), and accordingly his atomist view of perception can be seen as grounding a kind of proto-skepticism”.26 Democritus, Sextus relates, writes “in the text On the Forms, ‘With the help of these rules, man should realise [γιγνώσκϵιν] he is far from truth’. And again, ‘This discussion too shows that we in reality [ἐτϵῇ] know [ἴσμϵν] nothing about anything, rather for each there is a reconfiguring – a belief [ἐπιρυσμίν]’. And further, ‘Indeed it will be clear that it is not possible to know [γιγνώσκϵιν] what each thing is in reality [ἐτϵῇ]’. Here he puts nearly every possibility of knowledge in question, although he primarily refers only to sensory perception” (adv. Math VII.137, my translation).27 According to some of his successors, even Plato did not avoid it, animated as he was by similar distinctions and concerns.28 Indeed, in texts that go through and beyond atomism – e.g. the 10th C. syncretist Śāntarakṣita relies much on the principle that something cannot be both one and many.29 See Willemen in Sarvāstivāda Buddhist Scholasticism for the association of Vasubandhu with the Mūlasarvāstivādins (who Willamen identifies, controversially, with the Sautrāntikas), as opposed to the rival Sarvāstivādins, based nearby.30 Translated by Bhikkhu Bodhi in The Connected Discourses of the Buddha. All quotations of the Connected Discourses are drawn from this source.31 Probably, although there is only the one text that actually adds ‘and so with every mixture’ (see note 14), rather than focusing specifically on sensible properties as the ‘merely considered so’.32 Democritus seems to have thought there was a soul, but it is not clear he had a good atomist account of this. Was it an agglomeration of atoms, or a single atom? The evidence of Aristotle tells in favour of a heap of spherical fiery atoms (de Anima I.2, 403b30–404a9), but the implication that a soul is therefore real only by opinion seems not to have been drawn. Nor did Democritus seem to confront the difficulty of a multiplicity of soul atoms accounting for the necessary unity of the mental in cognition (this was a point on which the non-Buddhist Nyāya philosophers pushed the Buddhist no-self theory particularly trenchantly). In his accounts of cognition and his ethics, Democritus seems rather to have helped himself to a unity of soul which his metaphysics ought to have undermined.33 And although Diṅnāga will later define perception as that which is free from conceptual construction (Pramāṇasamuccaya I.i.3c and I.i.6ab) – and although perception is the superior pramāṇa throughout Buddhist thought, while inference is tainted by conceptualizing and is, therefore, distorting – still, this epistemological allegiance to perception was not the reason for positing dharmas as simples and ultimately real in the first place. Simple ultimately real constituents of reality seem to have been driven instead by logical (what is different cannot be the same) and metaphysical considerations (as the mereological reductionism of Milinda’s chariot, below).34 See Siderits, Buddhism as Philosophy, 53–6, for analysis of this passage in these terms; and Carpenter, Indian Buddhist Philosophy, 35–47.35 Carpenter, Indian Buddhist Philosophy, 40–2, examines the apparent slippage between ‘not identical to all of its parts’ and ‘not identical to some subset of its parts’, and offers an argument for why the latter, apparently more plausible option is also unsatisfactory.36 The distinction between the ‘two truths’, as they are called, fundamentally frames Sanskrit Buddhist philosophy and its successors, with different philosophers drawing the distinction in different ways. Sonam Thakchoe, “The Theory of Two Truths in India”, and Guy Newland, Appearance and Reality, both offer overviews and exposition of this contrasting pair, informed significantly by Tibetan doxographers.37 Trenton Merricks observes (in conversation, UVa, 20 Nov. 2020) that it is not this principle alone which does the work, but this principle plus a rejection of a building principle (as Karen Bennett calls them, in Making Things Up). Since any building principle (e.g. the constitutes relation, the composes relation, the inherence relation) is tantamount to an assertion of a multiplicity that it is indeed a real unity, I do not think the rejection of composition is anything over and above insisting that one cannot be many, thus putting the onus on any defender of a purported principle of composition to explain how it could be otherwise. In this debate, there are no direct arguments for or against the validity of any such principle: The Abhidharma Buddhist, like Theodor Sider (“Against Parthood”) will appeal to parsimony; their opponent to explanatory power. (In the contemporary discourse, the anti-nihilist may also point to the nihilist’s reliance on the appeal to ‘constituents arranged chair-wise’; but the Ābhidharmika is on firmer ground here, since they do not admit that the chariot-wise arrangement of simples is itself ultimately real). However, considerations of why some subset of chariot parts – let us say, those essential to its definitive function (an essentially Aristotelian option) – are not the real essence of the chariot are found in Carpenter, Indian Buddhist Philosophy, 40–3. My “Persons Keeping Their Karma Together” considers a minority Buddhist position which did seem to think that organismal unity calls for some additional explanatory principle; Vasubandhu argues against this Buddhist Personalist position in his “Treatise on the Negation of the Person”, traditionally found as Abhidharmakośabhāṣya IX, and available in a useful contemporary translation by Kapstein as Chapter 14, Part I, of his Reason’s Traces.38 I call this a ‘correlate’ because there are good reasons to be cautious about simply identifying them – not least because the appearing quality is not an apt way of distinguishing one side of the Buddhist distinction from the other.39 This and all translations of Vasubandhu’s Abhidharmakośabhāṣya are adapted from Pruden’s translation, with modifications by reference to Pradhan’s Sanskrit edition.40 See Cox, “From Category to Ontology” for discussion of the difference between these (and their contrast terms paramārthasat and dravyasat) and the evolution in early Buddhist philosophy from the one to the other, and towards conflating them. Karunadasa’s “The Dhamma Theory” describes how the canonical Abhidharma text, the Dhammasangani, already elaborates samutti as conceptual (paññatti/prajñapti), and how even in early Buddhism the distinction between ultimate and conventional “distinguishes between those types of entities that truly exist independently of the cognitive act and those that owe their being to the act of cognition itself” (20).41 I analyse Vasubandhu’s atomism in detail, including his rejoinder to the Problem of Contact, in “Atoms and Orientation”.42 Goodman, “The Treasury of Metaphysics”, offers detailed philosophical examination along these lines, though his further claim that Vasubandhu’s is a ‘two-tiered’ ontology is neither textually nor argumentatively warranted (see “Atoms and Orientation”, notes 16 and 18 for details). For Vasubandhu as offering a trope theory, see also Siderits, “Buddhist Reductionism”; and Ganeri, Philosophy in Classical India, 101–2.43 In brief: simples cannot decay (since that would imply parts), but only either exist or fail to exist. A non-existence cannot be created through external agency, so the cause of going out of existence must belong to the simple itself. But a simple cannot gradually ‘actualise’ different parts of itself or powers any more than it can gradually decay. Therefore this internal power to cause its own destruction must be fully realised upon the moment of the atom’s arising. Therefore, any simple must have strictly momentary existence.44 It also underscores the rejection of substance-property metaphysics implicit in dharma-theory (on which, see Williams, “On the Abhidharma Ontology”), as well as the way in which dharmas are more event-like than substance-like (on which, see Warder, “Dharmas and Data”, especially pp. 275 and 290).45 The precise argument here is obscure, and the dialectical relationship between the Twenty Verses and the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya is complicated. But here we may take the Twenty Verses passage to be putting forward for its own purposes the view that Vasubandhu has articulated (apparently) in his own voice in the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya.46 Nāgārjuna famously challenged whether this distinction could coherently be made, arguing that individuation itself is always dependent on contrasted ‘others’, and due to mental activity (see Carpenter, “Dependent Arising”). Vasubandhu does not seem to feel the challenge is a serious one.47 In fact, Democritus’ distinction between sensation and intellection as sources respectively of mis-information and information takes as granted and unproblematic the existence of the body, and this body distinct from others – e.g. “In the Confirmations, although he had promised to assign the power of assurance to the senses, he is nonetheless found condemning them, for he says, ‘But we in actuality grasp nothing precisely as it is, but rather as it shifts according to the condition of the body and things entering and pressing upon it’” (Sextus Empiricus, adv. Math. VII.136 (=DK 68B9) modified translation of KRS 553).48 Unless, of course, it leads to Platonism – which is just the assertion that the mind does indeed give us access to non-sensory reality as it is.49 Strictly speaking, so could Democritus’ atomism, if it were taken in a non-skeptical Platonic direction, with a robust account of the intelligible and intelligibility – and essentially left off being atomist. (That is to say, Democritus must give his non-bastard mode of cognition some appropriate objects to cognise). This is certainly not a lineage that either the subsequent atomist or skeptical traditions, or Plato himself, recognized.50 For instance, the sort of cultural relativism we might worry McDowell’s or MacIntyre’s views lead to by tying the very meaning and intelligibility of concepts to our shared practices. For McDowell, see his “Virtue and Reason” and “Two Sorts of Naturalism”; for MacIntyre see his After Virtue, especially Chapters 14 and 15. The spectre of the dismal slough of relativism is a crucial area of intra-Buddhist debate, as certain Madhyamaka Buddhist views seem unable to retain such a prospect of knowing a distinct ultimate reality and thus are in danger of pernicious relativism; on this, see Tillemans, “How Far Can a Mādhyamika Buddhist Reform Conventional Truth?”. For the record, it may be that the historical Protagoras’ relativism was in fact of the sophisticated sort, rather than the capricious individual sort that Plato first characterizes it as in the Theaetetus.51 See the prefatory verse and first two verses of Vasubandhu’s Abhidharmakośabhāṣya for his articulation of the claim, which I discuss in “Explanation or Insight?”.52 I argue for the importance of such an impersonal, unworldly ideal in “Ideals and Ethical Formation”, and explore the associated psychological implications in “Explanation or Insight?”.53 Witness the nature of many Buddhist meditational exercises, especially various analytic practices. Such meditational exercises were considered indispensable mental cultivation, and essentially salutary.54 For instance, Buddhaghosa in Visudhimagga IX, and Śāntideva in Bodhicaryāvatāra VI (for discussion of which, see, Carpenter, “Ethics Without Justice”).55 Is ‘minimisation of crime’ the goal? If so, does conceiving of individuals as divorced from their social context, and building practices of accountability on ascriptions of an internal autonomous will, actually reduce crime?56 Note that since this question only arises upon properly grasping the impersonal, non-substantial and processive nature of reality, it only arises as a question when the interpretation of it as ‘what is good for me?’ no longer makes sense.57 These ethical advantages even survive what one might think of as the ‘creeping skepticism’ of idealism. This would be a longer tale to tell. But Vasubandhu himself pushes Abhidharma Buddhism towards idealism; and yet in his idealist text, the Twenty Verses, with Commentary, he offers glimpses at Verses 8–10 of how the transition to full-blown idealism retains the ethical practices and advantages of discerning and analysing conventional reality. Moreover, Vasubandhu’s Yogācāra, both here and as articulated for instance in the Thirty Verses, retains a firm distinction between (realisation of) ultimate reality and conventional cognition. Indeed retaining an ultimate reality that was not conventional was something for which the Mādhyamika Candrakīrti could not forgive Yogācāra Buddhism.Additional informationFundingThis work was supported by provided the Ministry of Education, Singapore, material support, through research grant number R-607-263-215-121; and by the Templeton Religion Trust, with a fellowship under the auspices of the Beacon Project.",en
https://openalex.org/W4379803366,2023,Philosophy,"Jizang's Anti-realist Theory of Truth: A Modal Logical Understanding of Universal Affirmation through Universal NegationIn the writings of the Chinese Madhyamaka master Jizang (549–623 c.e.), we often read arguments that deduce universal affirmation from universal negation. In previous scholarship, this seemingly paradoxical reasoning was often explained by ascribing to Jizang a type of transcendental realism—the view that reality transcends our ordinary language, logic, and reason—and reading it as his unique way of capturing such a transcendental nature of reality. More recently, an attempt at formalizing this transcendental realist interpretation of Jizang was made by Yasuo Deguchi, who suggests that Jizang could have been tinkering with a type of dialethism. This article challenges the transcendental realist interpretation of Jizang by studying strong anti-realist tendencies found across his writings, and proposes a way to understand his deduction of universal affirmation from universal negation within the boundaries of ordinary reasoning and coherently with his anti-realist philosophy by introducing the modalities of ""categorical truth"" and ""conditional truth.""",en

Para tanto, realizou-se uma pesquisa descritiva, documental e de abordagem qualitativa, por meio da análise de 461 estudos de doutoramento. Nesses, identificou-se que o paradigma funcionalista – aquele que busca compreender a sociedade de uma forma pragmática e objetivista – ainda domina o posicionamento dos pesquisadores contábeis no país e, no caso dos procedimentos metodológicos, as pesquisas descritivas, documentais e com abordagens quantitativas prevalecem em cena. Nos suportes teóricos, o estudo mostrou que se destaca nessa área a utilização dos pressupostos de uma teoria (majoritariamente Teoria da Agência) e a ausência de lentes teóricas em um terço dos trabalhos analisados. Tal cenário ressalta uma tendência monoparadigmática e pouca diversidade teórica nas pesquisas de maior impacto da Ciência Contábil.

ABSTRACT The present study sought to identify the most predominant paradigmatic, theoretical approaches and methodological procedures in the theses of the Graduate Programs (PPGs) in Accounting in Brazil. For that, a descriptive, documental and qualitative research was carried out through the analysis of 461 doctoral studies. Of these, it was identified that the functionalist paradigm – the one that seeks to understand society in a pragmatic and objectivist way – still dominates the position of accounting researchers in the country and in the case of methodological procedures, descriptive, documentary research and quantitative approaches prevail on the scene. In terms of theoretical supports, the study showed that the use of the assumptions of a theory (mainly Agency Theory) and the absence of theoretical lenses in a third of the analyzed works stand out in this area. This scenario emphasizes a monoparadigm trend and little theoretical diversity in research with the greatest impact in Accounting. As a contribution, the study clarifies the individual positions of researchers in the area, discusses how scientific production is in the works with the greatest impact in the area and outlines new paths of analysis for the evolution of Accounting Science.

https://openalex.org/W4387531486,2023,Philosophy,"The The Designed Limitation of Human Epistemology and the Necessity of FaithThis article argues that the attacks of atheists or philosophers against the Islamic conception of God (i.e., Allah) are constructed on the misunderstood notion of Islamic theology. Because God is already at a station where the standards of reason alone are frivolous if His existence is understood vis-à-vis the claimed teleological essence of His message (Islam). The fundamental approach here is to highlight the doctrinally necessary transcendence of God vis-à-vis human epistemological tools in Islam in the light of its objective (i.e., a test of faith). This article demonstrates the normatively affirmed limitations of reason in logically necessitating the being of Allah under the faith-test dynamic of Islam, which is a necessary component of the purpose of human existence according to the Qur’ān. The article aims to establish the necessity of faith vis-à-vis a designed limitation of the capabilities of the logical arguments for God’s existence through three major claims: faith in the unseen, Allah’s signs in creation, and the trial of faith, all three being rooted in the Qur’ān. The article also explains the nature of imān in the system of Islamic epistemology, referring to the works of Abū Ḥāmid al-Ghazālī and Ibn Taymiyyah and highlighting the incoherent, unreasonable scepticism of atheists in attacking Islamic theism through the principles of reason.",en

https://openalex.org/W4379208974,2023,Philosophy,"Homeless ObjectsAbstract In this article, I shed some light on Meinong’s motivations for the theory of objects. I argue that one of its basic principles, the principle of indifference, is driven by an intuition common to many Austrian philosophers, which is that something must first be somehow pre-given in order to simply address the issue of its being or non-being. Meinong’s way of spelling out this intuition, I suggest, is to show that there are homeless objects, that is, objects that are not dealt with by any of the existing sciences. Therefore, the indispensability of the theory of objects lies in the plausibility of the thesis that there are such homeless objects. I analyse and evaluate two Meinongian arguments supporting this thesis, I explain how Meinong came to believe that they support the indispensability of the theory of objects, and I stress some advantages of this account over Brentano’s intentionality thesis.",en
https://openalex.org/W4376644411,2023,Philosophy,"Interstate Relational Ethics: Mengzi and Later Mohists in DialogueThe popular interpretation holds that Mengzi was strongly critical of Mozi because the Mohist moral theory was antithetical to Confucian relational ethics. According to this interpretation, Mohism promotes the norm of “impartiality” or “impartial care”, which violates the Confucian norms of “filial piety” and “graded love”. Accordingly, Mengzi thought that the Confucian ideal would not be realized if Mohism continued to prevail. Scholars have tried to nuance and revise this dominant interpretation. For example, some have pointed out the importance of family-oriented values in Mohist ethical theory, arguing that Mengzi likely misunderstood or purposefully mispresented Mohism. This article is an initial attempt to modify the popular interpretation by arguing that the debate between Mengzi and Mohist regarding relational ethics is predominantly about the relations between states rather than individuals. This interpretation sheds light on a core difference between Confucian and Mohist ethical theories and can help make better sense of some later Mohist passages.",en

According to Ibn Sina, the soul is the same as light, nūr, and non-physical being that becomes a source of knowledge, enlightenment, and truth.

Penelitian ini mengkaji motif kebutuhan yang mendasari adanya perkara cerai gugat akibat mental disorder yang dianalisis dengan maqashid asy-syari’ah. Studi ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui pertimbangan hukum yang digunakan oleh Majelis Hakim dan tinjauan teori maqashid asy-syari’ah terhadap perkara cerai gugat akibat mental disorder. Penelitian ini merupakan jenis penelitian hukum normatif dengan menggunakan pendekatan kasus (case approach) sebagai pendekatan penelitiannya serta menggunakan metode analisis kualitatif. Hasil penelitian ini menerangkan bahwa, menurut pertimbangan Majelis Hakim sesuai dengan Pasal 116 Kompilasi Hukum Islam huruf (e) yang menjelaskan jika salah satu pihak mengalami cacat badan atau penyakit dengan akibat tidak dapat menjalankan kewajibannya sebagai suami atau istri, yang menimbulkan pertengkaran dan percekcokan yang terjadi secara terus menerus, dan menurut teori maqashid asy-syari’ah pada rumah tangga tersebut terdapat kondisi yang mengancam pemeliharaan lima unsur pokok. Perceraian yang terjadi akibat suami mengalami mental disorder secara tidak langsung menunjukkan bahwa konsep perkawinan yang ideal tidak terpenuhi dan mengarah kepada mafsadah atau kerusakan. Berdasarkan hasil penelitian pada putusan No. 4309/Pdt.G/2021/PAJT tentang cerai gugat akibat mental disorder, sesuai dengan maqashid asy-syari’ah.&#x0D; Abstract. This study examines the motives of need underlying the existence of divorce cases due to mental disorders analyzed with maqashid asy-syari’ah. This study aims to determine the legal considerations used by the Panel of Judges and a review of the theory of maqashid asy-syari’ah on divorce cases due to mental disorders. This research is a type of normative legal research using a case approach as a research approach and using qualitative analysis methods.

I begin by framing the contours of this dispute as it was initiated by Barth and carried forward by his interpreters, who have sought in vain to make Barth's and Feuerbach's positions commensurable. Having narrated the history of this ongoing scholarly discussion and clarified why it remains intractable, I turn to Dietrich Bonhoeffer, whose this-worldly conception of theology, I argue, provides resources for ‘mediating’ the insights of Feuerbach and Barth. By attending to Bonhoeffer's earliest engagements with Barth on the question of divine revelation, and by exploring his striking proximity to Feuerbach on the issue of this-worldliness, we can see how Bonhoeffer helps overcome not only the dichotomies that plague the Barth–Feuerbach confrontation but also those that pervade modern attempts to safeguard this-worldliness by dispensing with divine transcendence.",en

The first doctrine is the equivalence between perfection, reality, being, and essence. The second doctrine is the Metaphysical Difference between that in which essence and existence are identical (God) and those things for which essence and existence are distinct (everything but God). The article is structured as follows. First, the author shows that these two key doctrines apparently clash. Second, she shows two ways in which this clash can be avoided. The first way consists in drawing a line between mere being and existence. This reading of Spinoza has sometimes been called “Platonist” in the secondary literature. The second way consists in denying that the Metaphysical Difference cuts reality at its joints. Instead, the Metaphysical Difference, on this reading, differentiates between appearances (those things in which essence and existence come apart) and reality (that thing in which they are one). This reading of Spinoza has sometimes been called Eleatic in the secondary literature. The author concludes by suggesting that, if the Spinozist rejects both the Eleatic and the Platonist approach, she is obliged to find another way to salvage her system.",en

You have been a great leader and we draw inspiration from you all the time” Born 06.11.1948 Died 11.12.2022 DR. V. BALASUBRAMANIAN B.Sc., MD, DM (Gastro) FRCP (UK) Patron - Indian Society of Gastroenterology - TN Chapter, Secretary - Tamil Nadu Gastroenterology Trust. Dear friends and colleagues, I was shocked, grief-struck, and collapsed when I heard the news about the tragic sudden and untimely death of my beloved teacher professor VBS. I hereby offer my tribute to this great teacher. My association with him has been for many decades starting from my PG days in the Department of Gastroenterology, MMC. He was always composed, polite, and a gentleman who respected everyone. He went about his chores with a smiling face. He always taught us clinical skills, which he said he imbibed from the Great Doyen of Gastro Prof. NMG. He had a great passion for teaching and was gifted with the knack of carrying along with even those who disliked him (very few). Be it UGs, PGs, junior colleagues, or senior consultations all were attracted toward him like a magnet because he was always able to solve their problems. At DDHD under Prof. Subhash, the department became a premier center doing therapeutic work, but it was Bala sir who single-handedly managed the sea of patients at the OP. He was instrumental along with Dr. KRP in reviving the TNISG and was deservedly made a patron. He shot to national fame after the successful organization of the Midterm and National ISG conferences. He motivated the seniors to establish the Tamil Nadu Gastroenterologist Trust, which is unique only to our state. This trust sponsors the journal. When I took over as Secretary in 2007, Sir told me, “Bhai (he is to address me like that) please arrange two seminars in our society.” – What gastro surgeons should know about medical GE and What MGEs should know about surgical GE. This was a great success. He made his life as exuberant and effervescent as possible by jeopardizing envy, hatred, pride, greed, and ego and left behind footprints on the sands of time to become a legend and icon for all of us to emulate. He along with Dr. KRP were the backbones of our society, but he alone undisputedly was a live wire (the void left behind cannot be replaced). He was a very passionate person much attached to his wife and two sons. I think he must have had a premonition about this tragic event, and just a few months back, he called me to be a witness for the “Will” he drafted. He lived a life full with a purpose to serve humanity in spite of all his physical disabilities. But man is helpless before the Almighty, and although cruel death has separated him from us, he will ever remain fresh in our hearts and memories. I offer my heartfelt condolences to his family and pray to the Almighty to give them the strength to bear the irreparable loss. RIP A heartfelt tribute from a beloved and obedient student, Dr. Mohammed Ali. Reminiscences of my dear friend “Dr. BALA” By Dr. Malathi Sathiyasekaran It was a jolt from the blue when I heard the shocking news on December 11, 2022, that my friend Dr. Bala was no more. Just a week before, I was informed that there was another setback in his health, but little did I imagine that I would not see him again. I was confident that he would bounce back as usual to the life he lived for others spreading joy and happiness to those around him. However, my confidence was shattered. My association with Dr. Bala dates back to more than three decades. Although Dr. Bala is no longer physically present, I am definite he lives in the hearts of many who knew him. Yes, “the song has ended but the melody still lingers on.” I am sure the book “Memories of Dr. Bala” will contain a number of pages filled with several anecdotes and events, which took place in his life. As I turn the pages, I want you to join me as I open and read the chapter titled “Those were the days in Govt. Peripheral Hospital. Anna Nagar.” This hospital was the brainchild of Prof. N Madanagopal whose dream was to establish it into an Institute of Digestive Diseases and Health. Dr. Jayanthi and I had the privilege of working with him from the time of inception of the department. After Prof. NMG retired, Dr. B Ramathilakam followed by Dr. S Subash headed the department. It was during this period that Dr. Bala, the charismatic gastroenterologist, joined the department with a warm, captivating smile and won the hearts of all the hospital staff. We were more like a family sharing the OP work, writing case sheets, doing rounds, and performing endoscopies and ultrasounds. Amid our work, Dr. Bala ensured that we enjoyed some lighter moments with his jokes and stories. We nicknamed Dr. Bala “the blue eyed boy” of the department because he was the favorite of the Head of the Department and therefore got special privileges! I would like to remember the attributes of Dr. Bala by using his name BALA as a mnemonic. B. Balanced personality: He could balance profession and family, work and leisure, and patient and colleagues. Ups and downs in life and mountain top and valley experiences. He could understand and handle the different moods of people very elegantly. A. Appreciative and Authoritative: Dr. Bala had a mix of both these qualities. He was very appreciative of others and always made it a point to openly comment and encourage their performance, either work or lecture. This inborn nature only reflected his humility and the love he had for his colleagues. He was not only appreciative but also authoritative. He has had several friends in all walks of life and could get things done just with a ping! “Bala solitaaru” was what I heard several times when he took decisions for TNISG. I still remember when he called and said “Malathi, You should give NMG oration” and the next time he called and said “Malathi we are making you the President of TNISG.” That was his capacity to command and sheer absolute ability to command and get work done. L. Leadership and Learning: Dr. Bala was not only a born leader but also a mentor to many and trained his juniors to attain and build leadership qualities. Dr. Jayanthi will remember the 1-day Endoscopy Camp that was meticulously planned and executed. The ability to keep everyone relaxed and complete the work with responsibility was a gift bestowed by God to Dr. Bala. I will always cherish the pleasant memories of the train journey. Dr. Bala was also a lover of learning anything new in gastroenterology and revising what he had learned. He loved to listen and was very attentive when others spoke and would be prompt to interact with the speaker. He also loved teaching, made gastroenterology very practical, and simplified whenever he shared his thoughts. His love for learning was one of the main reasons he encouraged in bringing out a journal from Tamil Nadu. A. Admirable: As I watched Dr. Bala, I noticed that he was admired and respected by his students, colleagues, and seniors. In addition, a host of paramedical staff admired him for his patience and care. The clerical staff were also very appreciative of his administrative skills. BALA, you have lived your life as a beacon of light to many. This light will continue to burn. Dear Dr. Bala, I know I will not see you again sitting in the first row during the future gastro meets. You will neither be there to encourage and appreciate when I give a talk nor be there to make us happy with your unforgettable smile we will miss you. You cannot be replaced but will be remembered.",en
https://openalex.org/W4386372909,2023,Philosophy,"The Eucharist in the Qur’anA passage in the Qur’an’s fifth sura (verses 112–15) relates that Jesus’s disciples asked him if God could send them a table or meal (māʾida) from heaven. The precise referent of this story and its significance have been the subject of debate in Qur’an scholarship. This study first argues that Q 5.112–5 refers to the institution of the Eucharist, by showing that worship is a central concern of Q 5 and that this passage is connected to earlier verses of the sura that refer to Christian worship. Second, the study provides a brief discussion of Christian conceptions of the Eucharist and of the prayers recited during this ritual in Late Antiquity, suggesting that the qur’anic account and its surrounding verses address critically three main issues: the affirmation of the Christian creed during the Eucharist, the capacity of this rite to bring about forgiveness and salvation, and the related idea of Christ as the prime mediator between God (the Father) and humanity. This critical engagement with Christian worship seems to be a reaction to Christian criticism of the Believers’ way of worship, which is referenced earlier in the sura.",en

The background of this article is the challenge that Paul deals with in Romans, namely predestination and the reference to good and evil in theology. It seems as if God ordained good and evil. God is, however, holy and totally good. Sources by Augustine, Calvin, Weaver, Van de Beek and others highlight the questions in this regard. The central implications of the cross of Jesus, as well as the issue of human responsibility are extremely relevant in this regard. The objectives are to give a sound theological evaluation of the question of good and evil from the perspective of reformed theology in interaction with Scripture. Interaction with Scripture and theologians leads to a literature study and thereafter exegetical, hermeneutical and systematic theology issues are addressed. The results established that different positions are taken, but God is just and not the author of sin. This implicates a clear view on mission: reject sin and turn to God. The conclusions are: God is holy, but all mankind should reject evil and accept that God is the fountian of good. Mission is the act of the Triune God (missio Dei) in Jesus Christ, through the Holy Spirit, to lead sinners from darkness to God. The good in Jesus Christ, by his death on the cross and in his resurrection, overcame evil.Contribution: The article illuminates the issue of good and evil in a new way and offers insight into its significance for the mission. This has significance for the current missiological engagement.",en

https://openalex.org/W4387265524,2023,Philosophy,"Why Was Original Buddhism for Monks Only?Early Buddhism was a monastic religion: the Buddha’s disciples were mendicant monks. However, there are many laypeople today who are practising Buddhists, meditating and following the eightfold Buddhist path towards nirvāṇa.This paper investigates how real this apparent inconsistency is. First, it is shown that the Buddha typically did not even speak about his own insights and doctrines to his lay followers; he only preached about general moral principles and gave wise advice, often with a noticeable conservative tinge. Since it is clear that Buddhism was not esoteric (i.e., it did not contain secrets revealed only to the initiated), this state of affairs can be explained only by supposing that the Buddha thought that true Buddhism was useful only for monks. It is never explicitly explained why it was so, but from several hints an answer may be tentatively reconstructed. Buddhist theory was only needed as a basis of Buddhist practice, and in the Buddha’s age and environment, such practice was virtually impossible for laypersons living and toiling in a village, with a family, and taking care of children. One could not find the peace essential for meditation. Furthermore, such worldly life presupposes strong motivations and unavoidably generates desires, whereas Buddhist practice consists of the annihilation of precisely those desires.",en

Schopenhauer and the Nature of Philosophy. Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2021. Pp. xviii + 183. Hardback, $95.00. It is a bit strange to read an overview of Schopenhauer's philosophy that does not center on the obvious and attention-grabbing idea of will, but Jonathan Head has brought a fresh and welcome perspective to the topic by focusing instead on Schopenhauer's notion of philosophy itself. This perspective enables Head to paint a more sympathetic picture of Schopenhauer than is often the case—more coherent in his systematic pretensions, more consistent in his philosophical project over the long course of his writings, and (perhaps most surprisingly) more solicitous for the welfare of his readers. Head's thesis is that Schopenhauer analyzed ('diagnosed' might be a better word) the human need for metaphysics and constructed his own philosophy carefully to address this need. ""The need for metaphysics,"" Head explains, ""is a natural desire that all human beings have for explanation and consolation, in the face of the recognition of pessimistic truths regarding the world we live in"" (xiv), specifically recognition of the ""wrongness of the world"" (51) and ""the illusory nature of the principle of individuation"" (70). Several quite specific metaphilosophical insights and methods arise from this seemingly straightforward statement. [End Page 528] For one thing, Head points out that explanation and consolation are rather different goals for philosophy, uniting theoretical and practical concerns in a way that might not be expected from a self-declared Kantian. But he argues for this dual functionality by tracing the notion of ""better consciousness"" from Schopenhauer's earliest writings to its evolution into a ""denial of the will,"" a form of consciousness with directly salvific consequences (interestingly, according to Head, not just for the individual but intergenerationally), now rooted in a metaphysics of will. The second and more philosophically fruitful peculiarity about Schopenhauer's diagnosis of the human ""need for metaphysics"" is the manner in which it arises from ""the recognition of pessimistic truths"" (xiv). There is a lot packed into the notion of recognition here. Schopenhauer has a distinctive philosophical method that grounds philosophical thinking in intuitive apprehension of basic truths. And, as Head argues, while this intuition functions as the ground for truth-seeking, it also hampers philosophy as a discursive discipline, since the concepts in which truth claims are presented cannot capture or communicate the unique proximity to truth characteristic of intuition. Thus, philosophical truths cannot be communicated directly, and the function of philosophical texts is to inspire an intuitive insight on the part of the readers so that they are able to see for themselves what the philosophy purports to say. (Stoicism, for instance, is for Schopenhauer an admirable but ultimately limited philosophical perspective in that it develops a system that relies exclusively on reason without promoting a grounding intuition.) Head argues that insight into the basic nature of the will is the intuition that Schopenhauer spins his philosophy around. This has both metaphysical and metaphilosophical implications. As for the former, it means that metaphysics is possible as a discipline, even in the wake of (and while by and large respecting) the limits Kant imposed on epistemology. Metaphysics has an empirical aspect, relying on empirical cognitive sources to provide a worldview for which it provides a key. Head emphasizes the irreducibility of this ""objective"" perspective, for offering both understanding as well as consolation (namely, knowledge that we have cognitive resources that other creatures do not). But Head argues that Schopenhauer gives primacy to the (compatible and complementary) subjective standpoint, and in particular our (quasi-speculative) intuition into the thing-in-itself via insight into our own basic essence as will. This peek into a nonrepresentational reality provides the reader with a guiding intuition (and the text with a central thought) that has an ""inbuilt [implicitly] inferential structure"" (72) from which an extraordinarily fruitful set of implications follows for constructing a metaphysics of will. The implications for metaphilosophy are no less interesting, and the central claim of Head's text is that Schopenhauer carefully constructed his central work, The World as Will and Representation, to guide...",en

""New paths in the theology and practice of sensus fidei""The current synodal process is fostering a deepening of the sensus fidei, as a precious theological treasure in the listening of the Spirit on the part of the People of God. It supposes an ecclesiological turn, which has its novelty in the intertwined reading of Lumen gentium 12 (sensus fidei) and 23 (local Churches). It foresees a new reception of pneumatology and a spiritual and binding dynamic of all the faithful, and introduces restitutio (or giving back) as a new step on the way to build the sensus totius populi. We are living an ecclesial stage in which a first emergence of what will be a synodal ecclesiality can be appreciated, though not fully yet theorized.

https://openalex.org/W4385191728,2023,Philosophy,"Perspectivalism about temporal realityAbstract It is usually agreed that reality is temporal in the sense of containing entities that exist in time, but some philosophers, roughly those who have been traditionally called A-theorists, hold that reality is temporal in a far more profound sense than what is implied by the mere existence of such entities. This hypothesis of deep temporality typically involves two ideas: that reality is temporally compartmentalised into distinct present, past, and future ‘realms’, and that this compartmentalisation is temporally dynamic in the sense that the boundaries of those temporal realms change from one moment to the next. The truth of something like this hypothesis is commonly thought to require that at least some of the facts that fundamentally constitute reality be tensed . While this seems plausible, realism about fundamental tensed facts does not seem to entail deep temporality. Nor is it clear exactly what realism about tense amounts to, given that no informative answer has been given to the question of what it is for a fact to be tensed. In this paper, I introduce a novel approach, perspectivalism about temporal reality , that seeks to vindicate the hypothesis of deep temporality by ascribing to reality a certain kind of temporally perspectival structure, which also provides a straightforward answer to the question of what the tensedness of facts consists in as well as to the question of what it is for reality to be constituted by such facts.",en

First, the article presents the phenomenology of prayer in the writings of phenomenologists such as Jean-Luc Marion, Jean-Yves Lacoste, Christina Gschwandtner and Natalie Depraz, indicating that the type of phenomenology and its relationship with theology influence the way in which they approach the theme of prayer. Second, the paper proposes a systematization of prayer, starting from the personal pronouns uttered when praying: I, you (thou) and he. “I” sees oneself as being called by God to a transfiguration which is impossible through one’s own powers and visible in the experience of the plenitude and joy of prayer; “You” provides the predicative dimension of the discourse and reveals communion either with God or, in the case of liturgy, with others; “He”, used less frequently in prayer, can constitute a source for a later theoretical discourse, being recognized as a “mysterious presence”. Following these analyses, the article concludes that there are two major relationships between phenomenology and theology: that of partial overlap, called theo-phenomenology, and that of rigorous delimitation. Regardless of the preferred model, the use of phenomenology for theology proves to be fruitful.",en

https://openalex.org/W4386093604,2023,History,"Lessing's Legacy Explored Through Her Personal ArchiveIn 1998, having just published the second volume of her autobiography, ‘Walking in the Shade,’ Doris Lessing appeared at the University of East Anglia's Literary Festival for the third time in a decade. At the end of the interview while still on mic, following audience questions and during rapturous applause, her interviewer and friend, Professor Christopher Bigsby, asked Lessing if he could announce what they had just been discussing regarding her papers. Lessing gave a firm no in response.1 Privately, Lessing had told Bigsby that she had decided to bequeath her personal correspondence and working papers to the University of East Anglia (UEA). Bigsby had known Lessing since 1980 when he first interviewed her at the BBC. They had formed a friendship, and Lessing had already made several trips to UEA campus to work with students. Bigsby, who had researched the embargoed Arthur Miller Archive at the Harry Ransom Center during the writing of his two-volume biography, understood the incredible generosity and magnitude of this surprising gift. Literary archives of preeminent writers can command vast sums. Lessing had already sold her manuscripts to the Harry Ransom Center and could have sold her correspondence. This generosity is entirely in keeping with Lessing the benefactor who, it is clear from her archived private correspondence, quietly made a very large number of generous charitable gifts during her lifetime, giving regular sums of money to friends, associates and organisations, even paying for several children's school fees throughout their education. However, the news of Lessing's planned donation was not universally celebrated at UEA. The announcement caused considerable anxiety within the university library, with the then Librarian rightly concerned that UEA's modest infrastructure would not do justice to such a high-profile deposit. While Faculty staff lobbied for the proposed gift to be acknowledged as soon as possible, Lessing confirmed the arrangement in her will. The Librarian of the day was overruled by stealth. The infrastructure was upgraded in 2005 and officially opened by the novelist, Rose Tremain, in 2006. In November 2007, Francis Fitzgibbon, the stepson of Lessing's lover, John Whitehorn, deposited the first Lessing material at UEA - 110 love letters written by Lessing in her mid to late 20s to Whitehorn and his friend, Col McDonald between 1945 and 1949, mostly from Southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, with the final few written from London shortly after her arrival. The letters, often thousands of words in length, are an extraordinary account of Lessing's writing, politics and motherhood. Both correspondents were RAF officers. At the time of the deposit in 2007, Lessing remarked on her decision not to re-read them: ‘There is a good deal of pain in those long ago far-away things’.2 Correspondence to a third RAF officer, Leonard Smith, was sold by Smith to Sussex University in the mid-1990s. The lack of consultation about the sale, and the attempt by Sussex to purchase John Whitehorn's collection of letters, infuriated Lessing.3 A year later on 13 February 2008, the year after her final appearance at UEA and the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature, Lessing wrote to Bigsby to tell him she had suffered a heart attack and would like him to send a car to collect some of her papers. She deposited an initial tranche of material consisting of 29 boxes (7 linear metres) from more than 1100 correspondents including Salman Rushdie, Rebecca West, Clancy Sigal, Nadine Gordimer and Muriel Spark to name just a few. A particular strength of the collection is that Lessing retained copies of a great deal of her outgoing correspondence, so that, unusually for a physical literary archive, both sides of a conversation were preserved together. In 2009, Margaret Drabble deposited her correspondence from Lessing. The letters reveal a warm and intimate friendship between two women and contain glimpses of their discussions on writing and literature. These three deposits, totalling 31 boxes (or 7.5 linear metres), provide fascinating insights into Lessing's life and the times in which she lived. But this was not the entirety of the archive. Lessing died on 17 November 2013 at the age of 94. Shortly afterwards, the remainder of her archive was moved to the University. This material is fully catalogued but remains under embargo awaiting the publication of Lessing's authorised biography, which the late Patrick French was working on when he died on 16 March 2023. French enjoyed privileged access to the material, in accordance with Lessing's will, and was afforded access to 40 years of personal diaries, otherwise embargoed until 2043. This tranche of archive material consists of a further 109 boxes or 27 linear metres, 31, if we include Lessing's personal diaries. So, apart from her personal diaries, what did Lessing hold back for her posthumous deposit? It includes more intimate correspondence reflecting close personal friendships and relationships. It also contains material showing greater detail regarding her political life, her activism, for example, in Afghanistan and her studies of Sufism and her research. There are also dream diaries, travel diaries and notebooks which form part of Lessing's creative process and an excerpt of which was curated by Nonia Williams, Academic Curator of the Doris Lessing Archive at UEA, during centenary celebrations. In 2019, UEA hosted Doris Lessing at 100, a series of events to mark Lessing's centenary year including an international conference of 85 delegates and an exhibition at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts which attracted 3835 visitors. There was also a series of public events with speakers such as Margaret Drabble, Roberta Rubenstein, Rachel Cusk, Lara Feigel and Emma Claire Sweeney. Conversations began with the Sainsbury Centre in late 2016. The original exhibition space was earmarked as 3 m2 before it was moved in 2017 to the mezzanine space of 29 m × 13 m. This move changed the nature of the exhibition from the presentation of perhaps twenty items to several hundred. The exhibition would also become ticketed, to recover some of the costs. The project team responsible for selecting material from the archive were all literature specialists and so were fascinated by Lessing's letters. But as the Curator of the Sainsbury Centre kept insisting: ‘You cannot put a book on the wall’. There were several challenges posed by the exhibition: Lessing's life spanned the major global events of the twentieth century. Her literary output was vast and varied, her involvement in politics, activism and her study of Sufism was frankly intimidating. The exhibition would need to involve an interdisciplinary team from within and beyond the University to interpret the material and to contextualise. UEA wanted to include selected material from the embargoed deposit, and this required delicate negotiation with the Lessing Trustees. Only two staff members were allowed to consult the embargoed material in its entirety – me as Archivist, and Paul Cooper an assistant curator and PhD student working under a confidentiality agreement. The breadth of material was so rich and the scale so great that the selection process was extremely challenging and beyond our expertise. We identified the dominant themes and major preoccupations in Lessing's life by noting subject categories where the volume of material was greatest. We then checked this understanding against that of the biographer's. An initial decision to exclude material relating to Lessing's 1962 novel, The Golden Notebook, and to focus on the ‘unknown Lessing' was later abandoned in favour of its inclusion, given the centrality of this text to Lessing's life and the archive. The requirement for visual material to recreate the backdrop to the different thematic and chronological stages in Lessing's life was a further challenge. While the project team wanted only to select visual material that Lessing herself had experienced, or collected, this was not possible. There was insufficient material of that nature in her archive, which is mostly text. Our museum and gallery colleagues knew some visitors would engage more in the text if a visual drew them in to a particular historical moment or landscape. They asked us to research visual material, unrelated to Lessing, that would conjure those key touchpoints in Lessing's life. The final exhibition included loans from a private collector of Sufi objects (Olive Hoare), the British Museum, which lent an ancient Sufi scroll depicting the kabbalah, which Lessing had once sketched. Magnum supplied images of Lessing but also of NASA, where Lessing had once visited as part of her research of preparation for life on Mars, and images of Africa and Afghanistan. Other loaned objects did have a direct relationship with Lessing: the National Archives' records of Mi5 surveillance of Lessing in the 1950s, a sketch of Lessing hung in the National Portrait Gallery. A late addition came when Lessing's friend and Trustee, Chloe Diski, daughter of Jenny Diski who lived with Lessing as an adolescent and young woman in the 1960s and 1970s, loaned some of Lessing's favourite possessions including: a globe, clothing, a favourite jug and tea cup, a sewing machine and record player and some jewellery and some carvings from Africa. This material lent a different kind of intimacy with Lessing, unlike the letters and other texts revealing Lessing's wit and the force and playfulness of her intellect and voice. The exhibition was critically acclaimed, with significant media coverage. Feedback from visitors suggested that the situating of object and text or visual and text, rather than being incongruous, worked together to conjure these contrasting periods of Lessing's life. While the programming of the exhibition within a major space gave the archive a wonderful canvas on which to share Lessing's incredible archive, we were conscious that we would only reach a particular demographic at the Sainsbury Centre. Norwich is fortunate to have one of the most visited libraries in the country, with an average of 2000 visitors per week. ‘A public library is the most democratic thing in the world. What can be found there has undone dictators and tyrants: demagogues can persecute writers and tell them what to write as much as they like, but they cannot vanish what has been written in the past, though they try often enough…People who love literature have at least part of their minds immune from indoctrination. If you read, you can learn to think for yourself’.4 Justine Mann is a Project Archivist at the University of East Anglia's British Archive for Contemporary Writing and was a Project Curator of the Doris Lessing at 100 exhibition at the Sainsbury Centre in 2019–2020.",en

https://openalex.org/W4367663569,2023,History,"Spitting at Jim CrowE. Franklin Frazier is rightfully remembered as one of the most important and influential sociologists in the United States, and one of the nation's most prominent Black sociologists. Although Frazier deserves this fame, it tends to overshadow his lifelong radicalism and refusal to accept (in practice or theory) the naturalness of Black oppression in the United States. This radicalism infuses all of his writing, but is especially evident in his earlier writings when, rather than an academic, Frazier was best known as a radical “New Negro” voice. When Frazier died of cancer in 1962, the American Sociological Review ran an obituary by his Howard University colleague G. Franklin Edwards. This obituary notes Frazier published ninety-nine articles, but only mentions one by name, “The Pathology of Race Prejudice” from 1927. That article's “satirical style,” Edwards notes, “bears a kinship to the technique employed by Frazier” in his famous Black Bourgeoisie. After noting “Frazier was forced by a white mob to leave Atlanta where he was then teaching” upon the publication of the article, Edwards underlines the two writings, “though published more than a quarter of a century apart, were tied together by more than a common style” because “in both of these works, Frazier demonstrated his determination to describe, analyze, and evaluate social reality as he perceived it, even when he was fully conscious that his evaluation would not be accepted by a great many readers.”1 Another Howard colleague, English professor Arthur Davis, in an obituary in the Journal of Negro Education, stressed how the two writings underlined Frazier's insistence on telling the truth about race relations in the United States: “Early in his career, [Frazier] was run out of Atlanta for an article he wrote on Southern whites; he was ‘lynched’ in the Negro press for his Black Bourgeoisie.”2Sociologist St. Clair Drake referred to “The Pathology of Race Prejudice” in his introduction to Frazier's The Negro Youth at the Crossways, published five years after Frazier's death: “Legend has proliferated about the circumstances of his retreat from Atlanta, with Frazier emerging from the telling as a sort of combative hero, fighting a rear-guard action against the Ku Klux Klan.”3 One study of Frazier in the late 1980s noted that “the 1927 article has become a legend in black history.”4 Ninety years after Frazier's article was published, a professor of African and African American Studies wrote about the article in an opinion column, “The Pathology of Delusion,” denouncing racist threats against Black scholars.5It is clear that as the hundred-year anniversary of Frazier's article approaches, it continues to resonate. At the same time, few scholars have examined Frazier's 1927 article or the circumstances surrounding its publication in depth. This lack of attention reflects the hybrid nature of the piece, as well as scholars’ neglect of Frazier's early writings, which have tended to be overshadowed by his later works such The Negro Family in the United States and The Black Bourgeoisie. Frazier's importance to American sociology justifies this attention to his later writings, but overemphasizing them contributes to diminishing Frazier's radicalism and militancy and overlooking how the radical ideals of his earlier writings continued to infuse his later publications. In the 1920s, before he earned his doctorate from the University of Chicago, Frazier had already developed a radical critique of Black oppression in the United States, reflecting and contributing to the reenergized “New Negro” trend in Black politics and culture in the 1920s. Although the term encompasses divergent thinkers from Black nationalists like Marcus Garvey to socialists like A. Philip Randolph, New Negro writers emphasized Black self-respect and rejected the idea that Black people were psychologically or psychiatrically damaged.6 “The Pathology of Race Prejudice” reiterates themes central to Frazier's radial vision.Rather than being the precipitous event that is often depicted, the article's publication reflected the culmination of years of tension between Frazier and the leadership of the Atlanta School of Social Work over the reality of racial segregation as well as themes that Frazier had been developing for several years. The present article examines the controversy around the publication of “The Pathology of Race Prejudice,” and argues that the value of Frazier's article is not its psychological examination of sex and racism, but its satire of Jim Crow attitudes and parody of racist social scientific writing. Because the article was written before Frazier began studying at the University of Chicago, understanding the article and the context in which it was written illuminates Frazier's radical early writings and their importance for his later thought. Rather than being a one-off attempt at humor or an angry retort to his soon-to-be former colleagues at the Atlanta School of Social Work, the article embodies themes that were central to Frazier's writings before and after. The purpose of the 1927 article was not to argue that Southern Whites were insane, but to highlight that race relations in the United States were not natural or logical.Not all scholars have oversimplified “The Pathology of Race Prejudice” or ignored its connection to Frazier's other writings. Anthony M. Platt's E. Franklin Frazier Reconsidered notes that of Frazier's writings of the time, this “was the most controversial and evoked the most discussion and debate.”7 Erin D. Chapman's Prove It On Me: New Negroes, Sex, and Popular Culture provides an incisive analysis of the article. After connecting Frazier's article to the tradition of Ida B. Well's anti-lynching classic Southern Horrors, Chapman situates the article in the context of Black politics of the 1920s, describing it as a “particularly explicit and unequivocal expression of New Negro progressivism.” Chapman stresses the gender aspects of the article, asserting that “Frazier's emphasis on manhood and defense of black men's patriarchal prerogatives and domains, including black women's bodies, were also emblematic of New Negro imperatives.” Unlike more cursory treatments, Platt and Chapman have contextualized Frazier's article, including its earlier origins. Although Platt and Chapman recognize the satirical nature of Frazier's article, neither provides a deeper analysis of the article, which is understandable because they deal with the article in the context of broader projects.8 The current article attempts to provide such a deeper analysis. Examining “The Pathology of Race Prejudice” helps better frame Frazier's radicalism, locating the roots of themes that he developed in his mature writings in his writings from the 1920s. It also anchors the radicalism of these earlier writings in a broader Black radical tradition.Frazier's article asserted that “the behavior motivated by race prejudice shows precisely the same characteristics as that ascribed to insanity.” Frazier labeled this “the Negro-complex,” which, he argued, was not innate, but “an acquired psychological reaction.” He observed how “the Negro-complex obtrudes itself on all planes of thought,” for example, when Whites oppose health programs, the selective draft, or woman suffrage, because these would benefit Blacks. Racists cannot be disabused of their racism through appeal to facts, because “just as the lunatic seizes upon every fact to support his delusional system, the white man seizes myths and unfounded rumors to support his delusion about the Negro.” Instead of treating racism as natural part of human existence, Frazier declared “certain manifestations of race prejudice” are “abnormal behavior.”9The most controversial aspect of the piece is Frazier's emphasis on interracial sex. “When,” Frazier wrote, “two systems of incompatible ideas cannot be kept from conflict, the insane man reconciles them through the process of rationalization. Through this same process of rationalization the Southern White man creates defenses for his immoral acts, and lynching becomes a holy defense of womanhood.” Frazier asserted, “The energetic measures which Southerners use to prevent legal unions of white with colored people look suspiciously like compensatory reactions for their own frustrated desires for such unions.” He added: Where the conflict between the personality as a whole and the unacceptable complex is not resolved within the mind of the subject, the extremely repugnant system of dissociated ideas is projected upon some real or imaginary individual. Except in the case of those who, as we have seen, charge the Negro with an inherent impulse to rape as an unconscious defense of their own murderous impulses, the persistence,—in the face of contrary evidence,—of the delusion that the Negro is a ravisher can only be taken as a projection. According to this view, the Southern white man, who has,—arbitrarily without censure,—enjoyed the right to use colored women, projects this insistent desire upon the Negro when it is no longer socially approved, and his conscious personality likewise rejects it.10Frazier then turned to sexual relations between White women and Black men: “Hallucinations often represent unacceptable sexual desires which are projected when they can no longer be repressed. In the South a desire on the part of a white woman for a Negro that could no longer be repressed would most likely be projected,—especially when such a desire is supposed to be as horrible as incest. It is not unlikely, therefore, that imaginary attacks by Negroes are often projected wishes.”11 In other words, Frazier wrote, White Southerners’ racism resulted from repressed sexual attraction towards Black people that was projected onto Black people themselves. The argument that White women are in a constant state of lust for Black men inverts the standard racist argument that all Black men are in a constant state of lust for White women. This inversion highlights the importance (and hypocrisy) of the sexual blood line that underscores Black oppression in the United States. Frazier's point is the absurdity of race relations in the United States. It is the entire system of race relations that is pathological and the broader social insanity is that most people (not just “the population of the asylum”) accept this as natural. The piece's radicalism, then, is not Frazier's provocative argument about sex, but how he uses these to expose the pretensions of scientific reality of race relations.Newspapers as far as Canada and California excerpted Frazier's article, but the strongest reaction was closer to home.12 On June 10, veteran White Southern journalist Sam W. Small highlighted the article in his column in the Atlanta Constitution. Small began by asserting “the inescapable fact” of the inevitability of racism: “Not before the world is consumed by fervent heat . . . will there be understanding and accord between the white and negro races of America.” Small (whose dialect sketches in the Constitution in the 1870s have been credited with being the prototype for the Uncle Remus character) left clear his own views, describing himself as a man “born here in the south on premises swarming with negro slaves, who grew up in daily contact with them, saw them emancipated, has lived here in Atlanta for more than 66 years . . . and whose only prejudice against the negro is that I prefer not to eat and sleep with him.” After quoting The Forum's description of Frazier, including his full name and job title, Small quoted several paragraphs from Frazier's article, dismissing it as “unimportant, because as circumstantial as it is unscientific.” Small added: “But there is one argument in it that is revolting for its suggestions.” He continued: “This suggestion that the primarily guilty party in case of sexual outrage by negroes upon white women is the white woman herself through the intangible incitement of her own desire, is the vilest that this writer has ever encountered in his lifetime. The author of it is evidently more insane by reason of his anti-white complex than any southerner obsessed by his anti-negro complex.”13Two weeks later, the Baltimore Afro-America ran an article under the front-page headline, “School Head Flees Dixie Lynchers.” The paper from Frazier's hometown wrote, “Following the appearance of the article on the news stands, local newspapers published references to it and whites over the telephone threatened Mr. Frazier with a lynching. Friends hurried him out of town.” According to the paper, the Fraziers escaped to Baltimore, then moved to Chicago.The article asserted, “Frazier has been forced out of the principalship of the Atlanta School of Social Service after five years’ service” because “trustees of the school felt that his ideas on race equality were too far advanced for the South.”14 A month later the paper reprinted a statement from the Board of Trustees of the Atlanta School of Social Work that clarified that the Board decided to replace Frazier in January, but Frazier refused to resign. “If the Atlanta School of Social Work had been disposed to remove Mr. Frazier because of any of his magazine articles or his personal views,” the statement read, “it could have done so long ago. . . . As a matter of fact, Mr. Frazier was asked to resign because he did not prove as effective an executive and administrator as was needed.”15 Filled with bureaucratic jargon, the statement, buried on an inside page, did little to dampen the legend of Frazier's escape from Atlanta.In late August, Sam Small's column in the Constitution again turned to Frazier's article. Small denounced the article as “strongly offensive to southern readers.” Small claimed “race prejudice” against Black people in the South was natural and inevitable, adding: “The psychogenesis of it is instinctive race repulsion and the function of it is the inhibition of inter-racial social equality.” Small described Reconstruction, the period of interracial democracy after the Civil War, as the root of current Southern race problems and “since then ‘white supremacy’ has become with us as cardinal principle as any in science or religion.” Small took aim at Frazier's central argument: “The lynching in the south of more negroes than whites is proffered as proof as race prejudice having a psychosis of insanity. That theory is ridiculous. A lynching that would be an act of insanity would be a guiltless act; but a lynching is never anywhere an act of insanity.” Recalling the “five mob lynchings in the south” he had covered as a journalist—two of White victims and three of Black victims—Small wrote: “In each case, the mob pulsed with a common feeling of intolerable outrage and acted with the common purpose to execute an earned penalty without awaiting the leaden-footed operation of the community's legal machinery. Lynching anywhere in our country is criminal and indefensible. That more lynchings occur in the south than other regions is true. The fact is obviously explicable. In the south more negroes commit crimes that incite mobs and the negroes that are lynched are executed because of their crimes, and not because of their color.” Small emphasized the presence of “race prejudice in the make-up of the negro” and “antipathy to the white race.”16 He cited the original Afro-American story that Frazier had been fired for the article, as if to take credit for this.“The Pathology of Race Prejudice,” was not the reason Frazier left the Atlanta School of Social Work; he had written the article years earlier and had already resigned his position at the school to study at the University of Chicago when it was finally published. Instead, the article was the culmination of several years of conflict between Frazier and the Board. The Atlanta School did not fire Frazier because of “The Pathology of Race Prejudice,” but the article encapsulated the differences between Frazier's radicalism and the Board of Trustees’ conservatism. Furthermore, the article, and the image of it causing Frazier to lose his job and having to flee Atlanta one step ahead of the Klan, solidified Frazier's reputation as a defiant opponent of Jim Crow, a “race man” who asserted his manhood in the face of Klan terror. The press coverage of Frazier's article made Frazier infamous. Fellow sociologist Charles Johnson wrote to Frazier, “everywhere I went [in Atlanta] the colored populace was asking, ‘Have you read Frazier's farewell to the South.’”17Today Frazier is remembered as a leading sociologist of Black America, but in the 1920s he was beginning his academic career. Frazier graduated from Howard University in 1916 and taught mathematics for a year at Tuskegee, then taught briefly in Maryland and Virginia before earning a master's degree in sociology at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1920. Over the next several years, Frazier had fellowships at the New York School of Social Work and the University of Copenhagen. In 1922 Frazier moved to Atlanta, first to teach sociology at Morehouse College and then to become director of the Atlanta School of Social Work. In 1927—shortly after his article on “Racial Pathology” was published—Frazier left social work and enrolled in doctoral studies at the University of Chicago under the supervision of Robert Park.18The importance of Frazier's radicalism tends to be overshadowed by his later academic success. Frazier's radicalism is evident in his master's thesis, “New Currents of Thought among the Colored People of America,” which examines what would later be termed the “New Negro” movement and which Frazier refers to the “new school” of Black thought. This begins with a survey of Black thought from the end of the Civil War through the early twentieth century. Then Frazier, focusing primarily on A. Philip Randolph and Chandler Owen's The Messenger, describes how, “within the last few years a new school of radical thought has sprung up among Negroes.” Calling this trend “the most fundamental and thorough movement ever initiated among Negroes,” Frazier contrasts it to the radicalism of Frederick Douglass that was based on “abstract principles of rights” and the later radicalism of W. E. B. Du Bois, which “relied on the conscience of the American people and the courts.” He argues that “this new school begins its career by a scientific analysis of the problem and relying on the force of the Negro as an economic factor, and ignoring abstract principles, concludes that only force, economic and otherwise, can secure recognition for the Negro.”19 This radical perspective infuses “The Pathology of Race Prejudice,” with its attempt to undercut the scientific justification of race prejudice and the determination to reject this.One of the issues that Frazier examines is “social equality,” which he describes as “the rallying cry of the South whenever she wants defense or justification for denying the Negro even his primary rights. No one seems to know what it means; for it may be the right to invite a colored person to dinner or it may be expanded to include the right to vote.” Frazier quotes from The Messenger's defense of “‘Social Equality’ in every sense of the phrase.”Frazier concludes that “there is no need of comment on this other than that the authors add that this stand is not based on the inferiority of his race, but ‘because of our recognition that the principle of social equality is the only secure guarantee of social progress—the inevitable trend of evolution.’”20 Frazier developed this argument, wrapped in satire, in “The Pathology of Race Prejudice.” This radicalism—a militant opposition to segregation and support to social equality between Black and White people—remained constant throughout Frazier's writings.Frazier's subsequent renown as a sociologist, and Park's wide influence, often overshadow his five years in Atlanta. However, they were seminal in Frazier's personal, political, and intellectual development. The segregation of the South chafed Frazier. In Atlanta, “he openly broke with the segregationist system, in and out of academia,” according to Martina Mallocci, and found himself “on the most extreme fringes of the civil rights movement.”21 Frazier once stormed out of a segregated meeting of social workers; on another occasion, he demanded a White bank teller either call him “Mr. Frazier” or allow him to refer to the teller only by surname.22 In an article from 1924 in The Crisis about a visit to the optometrist, “All God's Chillun Got Eyes,” Frazier described how he had walked up to the thirteenth floor rather than use a Jim Crow elevator. Frazier tried to balance his self-respect and the reality of segregated education in the South.23In Atlanta, Frazier published thirty-three articles—a productivity to rival the lifetime output of many academics. Frazier's Atlanta writings fell into three broad groups.24 The first included essays about the Atlanta School that “were nothing more than column-length advertisements for the Atlanta School or for social work in general,” as Jonathan Scott Holloway describes them.25 The second group comprised articles on traditional academic subjects, such as “The Cooperative Movement in Denmark” and “Psychological Factors in Negro Health.”More controversial were articles against segregation and Black oppression, written in what Holloway calls “blunt language and style” that was “acerbic and highly opinionated.”26 Frazier directed these writings against Southern racists and middle-class Black leaders who accommodated themselves to Jim Crow degradation. In “The Negro and Non-Resistance,” published in The Crisis in March 1924, Frazier denounced “a growing number of colored people who arrogate to themselves the possession of such Christian humility that they must condemn the activities of the so-called agitators and others who insist that the Negro shall enjoy the same rights as other Americans.”27 Frazier excoriated those “spokesmen of the race, who assert that we are satisfied with an inferior status in American society.” He denounced them because “they refuse to protest against the greatest crime of the age—the denial of personality to the Negro.”28 In other words, half of Frazier's output was dedicated to advocating racial uplift and social work promoted by White foundations, and the other half was dedicated to defying this outlook.Frazier's tenure at the Atlanta School was equally contradictory. Although Frazier was no stranger to racial segregation, most of his experience had been in Baltimore or Washington, DC, not the Deep South. According to Frankie Adams, who began working at the Atlanta School several years after Frazier left, “Atlanta was solidly segregated in terms of eating places, streetcar transportation, and to some degree the opportunities to try on certain pieces of clothing in the various department stores.”29 In this segregated environment, the Atlanta School sought to create a cadre of Black social workers and social reformers to uplift the Black population in Atlanta and the South. Like the city's other Black universities and colleges, the Atlanta School depended on the support of Black elites in Atlanta and donations from liberal White foundations.Founded in 1920, the Atlanta School was the first Southern school dedicated to training Black social workers. The School admitted both men and women, had an interracial faculty who published in professional journals, and had courses that studied the Black experience. The school drew upon the model of sociologist W. E. B. Du Bois (who had taught at Atlanta University decades earlier) in establishing high-quality scientific-based education for social workers that recognized the constraints of Jim Crow while challenging its intellectual underpinnings. In an essay about Black people in Georgia, published in The Messenger in June 1924, Frazier describes the state's racist history, but points to the “promising feature of the inter-racial situation [of] the attitude of those engaged in social welfare work.” Frazier describes how, at a state conference of social workers, “Negroes participated as other human beings, without being segregated as cattle or microbes, as is the orthodox way of dealing with bootlicking Negroes who submit to such humilities.” Frazier had one foot in what he would later term the Black bourgeoisie and another in Black radicalism.30Frazier's experience in Atlanta in the 1920s expanded rather than tempered the radicalism evidenced in his master's thesis. Frazier's “Pathology of Race Prejudice” reflected his intense feeling of equality, in the face of segregation. According to one study of social work in Atlanta, “The complete professionalization of the Atlanta School of Social Work occurred under Frazier,” who oversaw the school's incorporation and charter and move to its own downtown location.31 Despite this success, Frazier clashed with Helen Pendleton, an older White social worker. As Anthony Platt describes it, “Pendleton was in fact unusually liberal regarding race relations but still could not accept Frazier's having any authority over her.”32 Originally from West Virginia, Pendleton had earlier been a social worker in Baltimore; Greenwich, Connecticut; Newark, New Jersey; Pittsburgh; San Francisco; and Savannah, Georgia. According to New Jersey civil rights leader William Ashby, Pendleton had been “literally run out of South Carolina” as a youth for opposing discrimination and persecution of Black people there. Later, Pendleton was the executive secretary of the New Jersey Negro Welfare League (the predecessor of the Urban League), which helped Black newcomers adjust during the Great Migration. An article, “Cotton Pickers in Northern Cities,” from 1917 combines an acute sense of the discrimination confronting Black migrants from the South with a patronizing attitude towards these “unsophisticated country people.”33When Frazier started at the Atlanta School, he and Pendleton had equal rank and reported to the School's board of trustees. After the School was incorporated in 1924, Frazier became Pendleton's supervisor. According to Holloway, “Frazier and Pendleton became embattled over the office hierarchy, their responsibilities at the school, and the questionable proprietary of a black man giving orders to a white woman.” Frazier complained to the Board about Pendleton's long vacations, her insubordination, and her racist secretary, whereas “Pendleton appealed to the white members of the board and instilled in them a concern about Frazier's mental and psychological balance and his refusal to adjust to southern practices.”34Frazier wrote “The Pathology of Race Prejudice” years before his dispute with Pendleton culminated in his dismissal and decision to leave Atlanta, contrary to what the Afro-American wrote at the time and some academics have written since.35 In April 1927 Frazier applied for a fellowship from the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial to finance his studies in Chicago; the curriculum vitae included with his application lists “The Pathology of Race Prejudice” as forthcoming in the June Forum.36 The Memorial's contact on the Atlanta School's Board of Trustees, Will Alexander, wrote to the Memorial, praising Frazier's ability but implying that he had problems getting along with other people and that further research experience would make him “less likely to become simply an agitator.”37 Alexander wrote again, two weeks later, clarifying that “Mr. Frazier's experience in the Atlanta School of Social Work should not be marked against him.” Although Alexander did “not consider that [Frazier] has the executive temperament,” he emphasized extenuating circumstances, including the fact that Frazier became director of the school when its original head suddenly died. “Mr. Frazier inherited a staff that would have been difficult for anyone to work with. I do not, therefore, consider that his reaction to the situation is an evidence that he cannot work harmoniously with his associates. Under other circumstances, I could conceive of the results having been quite different.”38 John Hope, president of Morehouse College, urged the Memorial to grant Frazier a scholarship and argued that Frazier's experience as director “has had a sobering and, I may say, a chastening effect upon him.”39In a State Department form that Frazier completed in 1953 for security clearance to work for UNESCO, he wrote that his employment at the Atlanta School ended when “I was fired because I advocated racial equality and democracy in the South.” 40 FBI agents, scouring Frazier's history for any evidence of subversion or communism, interviewed people at every place of employment that Frazier had listed, even visiting professorships. In Atlanta, three professors told the agents that John Hope had requested Frazier's resignation because “Dr. FRAZIER was apparently more interested in outside activities such as speeches and writing than he was in the administrative duties attached to the work of the Director of the School.”41 If the FBI interviews are accurate, we can conclude that although Frazier was not fired because of his article, similar writings and speeches had contributed to the Atlanta School's administration desire to see him leave. And the furor allowed Frazier to leave with his dignity intact, transforming what could have been a stain on his curriculum vitae into a demonstration of his bravery and opposition to Jim Crow and the Atlanta Black establishment and liberal foundations.One question is whether Frazier expected this strong reaction. “The Pathology of Race Prejudice,” is powerful because it addresses the most volatile issues in American race relations: the sexual line drawn in blood and the definition of race. The inherent violence under slavery made sex (rape) between White men and Black women central to slavery. The distinctive “one drop rule” in the United States (",en

https://openalex.org/W4382302063,2023,History,"Morphological Evolution of a Commercial Setting: The Study of Konya Uzum BazaarUrban morphology aims to formally study the movement in space and to detect the changing character of cities in the context of time, space and physical environment. When the morphology of Konya in the historical process was examined, the first formation developed around the settlement center known as the historically prominent Alâeddin Hill. Over time, the Mevlâna Dargah and its surroundings, which are religiously prominent, appear as the second focal point. The commercial texture that was born and developed between these two focuses in Konya is the traditional Konya Bazaar. In this commercial texture, the “Uzum Bazaar”, located to the west of the second focal point of the city, was formed in harmony with the surrounding texture during its period. After the Uzum Bazaar continued its life for many years, it was demolished, and Mevlâna Bazaar was built in its place, described as a contemporary ‘passage’ in its period. At the beginning of the 21st century, this commercial texture was included in the scope of the transformation project, and the Altın Bazaar period began. The morphological change of this historical and commercial texture, which was called the Uzum Bazaar in the past, according to the periods, was studied by the Space Syntax method and evaluated comparatively. As a result of the analyses and evaluations conducted, it has been determined that the gate counts and intelligibility values have been continuously decreasing in the process following the Uzum Bazaar period, which is characterized as self. According to the integration value, it has been seen that the Uzum Bazaar period, which was formed as part of the traditional Konya Bazaar, has a higher value compared to the Mevlâna Bazaar and Altın Bazaar periods. Although the numerical values of the Altın Bazaar period are close to the Uzum Bazaar period in the connectivity analysis, they are higher than the values of both the Uzum Bazaar period and the Mevlâna Bazaar period. As a result, when the formation of the Uzum Bazaar in the first period is described as ‘essence’, it can be said that steps have been taken towards the “return to essence” with the transformation of the Altın Bazaar in the last period.",en

Around 50 loyalist prisoners were subsequently, and controversially, convicted of treason and 5 hanged. The battlefield site was only identified in 2008 and the land was purchased by the American Battlefield Trust in 2018. This article aims to present results from a forensic archaeological search to answer two questions: (1) was it possible to identify the burial ground(s) for site preservation from this historic battlefield site; and (2), were the fallen soldiers from the battle buried in a mass grave or in individual interments? Search methods included a phased investigation approach of a desk study, then ground searches involving cadaver dogs, geophysics (GPR), and subsequent forensic archaeological excavation and soil analysis (specifically mtDNA and VOC extractions) to recover possible trace evidence of human burials. Results suggest the main battlefield burial area was able to be identified, with 24 cadaver dog alert locations, geophysical and soil anomalies suggesting individual burials where fallen soldiers were interred. Archaeological excavation found contemporary battlefield artifacts, and although human remains were not recovered, the soil analysis showed the presence of mtDNA in these locations. Despite the difficult ground search conditions due to the large search area, 200 + years age of burials, and limited remains, such a focused search strategy has been proven to be an effective approach to detect other historic battlefield burial sites.",en

Imperial Interventions in Aegean Waters, 1821–1827Virtually every publication on the Greek Revolution signals the Battle of Navarino (20 October 1827) as a turning point in international involvement with events in Greece. What the historiography tends to ignore, however, is the significant degree of military intervention that preceded 1827, particularly at sea. Yet, the Greek Revolution was six years underway and had already taken to the sea by the time of Navarino. Several naval actors at Navarino had been involved in the maritime handling of the revolution since its very beginning, including the Royal Navy captain Gawen Hamilton, the French Vice-Admiral Henri de Rigny and the Algerine commander Mustapha Bachalî Raïs. What had they been doing before then in the seas around Greece? By looking at the first phases of the Greek Revolution, from 1821 to 1827, this article clarifies how different imperial powers tried to manage the uncertainties and threats that the rebellion brought to the waters of the Mediterranean. It draws from source material on the navies of Great Britain, France, Austria and the Ottoman Empire. The piece provides three insights that highlight the significance and contingencies of imperial involvement in the first phase of the revolution. These insights relate to: (a) belligerency at sea; (b) the security threats of piracy and privateering; and (3) naval interventionism.",en

https://openalex.org/W4365459861,2023,History,"<i>The Selected Letters of John Berryman</i> ed. by Philip Coleman and Calista McRaeTeaching at Harvard in early 1942 and about to have a pamphlet of poems published by New Directions for its Poet of the Month series, John Berryman rebuked the press’s founder James Laughlin for making public what was meant to be private:Whether his rage erupted from the letter’s contents, Laughlin’s careless impropriety, or both, Berryman understood that “in letters, as in no other form of writing, the man appears” (1). That thought, written in an undergraduate essay at Columbia, would resurface decades later in a letter to his seven-year-old son, Paul: “I would expect you to keep my letters, so that you can read them when you are older. It is a source of pain to me, still, that I have no letters from my father, who died when I was twelve” (500). When Berryman took his own life on January 7, 1972, Paul would be just shy of his fifteenth birthday.In June 1959, released but still “not at all well” (374) after a month’s stay at Glenwood Hills Hospital in Minneapolis, Berryman—haunted by a premonition—hastily wrote to Ann Levine, his recently divorced second wife: “In case of fatal accident or death by illness I wish this letter to serve as a will.” At the funeral, there should be no eulogies, but if “anything is to be read, perhaps the last four sections of Whitman’s Song of Myself would do,” and for music, “Beethoven’s Op 130 or St James’s Infirmary, King Oliver’s recording. But it couldn’t matter less.” He was not to be cremated and did not care where he would be buried, except “not in the Twin Cities or Iowa.” The manuscript of The Dream Songs “as it stands, on my desk in a black binder, I would like copied and sent to Faber & Faber for publication.” When Paul turns twenty-one, he is to decide whether the large manuscript of sonnets written in 1947 should be published or destroyed; also for Paul’s discretion, his “verse manuscripts” since “they may possibly prove worth money.” Berryman’s extensive notes on Shakespeare and the Shakespearean part of his library might be sold to the Princeton Library; “I doubt whether the 200-page Ms. of the biography of Shakespeare is worth bothering with in its present form.” And “all my journals & diaries & all such notes,” he requested, “destroyed at once unread; also my correspondence. I express the wish that there may never be a biography” (378–79).More than a decade later, Berryman’s widowed third wife, Kate Donahue, deposited his papers in the University of Minnesota Libraries’ Rare Book Division. It is unclear if she knew of his letter to Levine, and like many widows it was left to her to manage her husband’s effects. Since then, scholars and editors have gone through Berryman’s archive and have published poetry and prose, a selection of letters to his mother, critical studies of the poems, and two biographies. Now comes his Selected Letters, which “represent a direct testimony,” writes Berryman’s daughter Martha B. Mayou in the foreword, “in a voice that is substantially different from a biographer’s: the reader is listening in on the writer speaking about his life and work” (vii).The editors have chosen letters that “shed light on Berryman as writer,” yet note that he “rarely stops talking about his work: almost all of his correspondence is primarily literary correspondence, even when it is also deeply personal” (5). To help narrow their broad range, they have omitted letters that contain information about living individuals and letters already published to avoid “extensive overlap” (4) with previous publications. “Extensive overlap” achingly underdescribes the situation. For instance, between fall 1928 and spring 1932 as a student at South Kent, Berryman wrote “some seven hundred pages of letters” to his mother and, as the editors explain, “many of those South Kent letters” were included in Richard J. Kelly’s We Dream of Honour: John Berryman’s Letters to His Mother (1988). Kelly, however, published only seven letters from these years; the editors, five letters, having silently skipped over 1929 and 1931. (Kelly has two letters from 1929, one from 1931). No letters overlap.Milton’s lines from Paradise Regain’d—“the childhood shews the man, / As morning shews the day”—ring true for Berryman since these prep school letters show a cheerful, doting son eager to please his mother; to break this pretense, the editors have interspersed a brutally self-aware and painfully self-conscious letter to his stepfather that includes the confessional lines “South Kent is no place for me—there are nice fellows here who will be something in life and I never will be anything anyhow”; “I have none of the fine qualities or emotions, and all the baser ones. I don’t understand why God permitted me to be born. I’m undesirable and a nuisance everywhere I go”; and in the postscript: “I’m a disgrace to your name” (16–17). The last letter from South Kent to his mother, written on a cold, rainy day in May 1932, is a lengthy and apologetic treatise written “in a theme, in an orderly and rational fashion,” on why he should be allowed to transfer from the all-boys boarding school to high school. He was “very awkward and self-conscious” around girls (when he did see them) and had “come to regard girls merely as a bunch of organs, without taking into consideration their intelligence and individuality.” Another year at South Kent “would make it a long and very difficult task for me to accept girls as a natural and normal thing and to be easy and natural in relations with them” (19). Conscious of his reader, he made sure to note that “many fellows from sheltered preparatory schools go absolutely hog-wild when they get to college, you know.” He had acquired the “typical smug attitude of many fellows—‘Well, I’m a prep school fellow, and as such a great deal better than many of these men you see.’ A lot of the fellows up here even look down upon great men who haven’t had a good education, and while I’d never go that far,” he assured his mother, ‘I don’t think a year at High School would hurt a bit’” (20). His “strong habit of cursing and blaspheming,” too, had grown steadily. And although he possessed an “excellent” mind, he had “habits of loafing” he could not shake; besides, he wrote, “I feel that during the four years that I’ve been here, I’ve learned about all that the school can teach me” (21). “He was the first boy,” writes John Haffenden (1982: 51) in The Life of John Berryman, “in the history of the school to by-pass the sixth form and to go straight from the fifth into college.”Those who want “the fullest picture of Berryman’s college years” (4) should turn to E. M. Halliday’s John Berryman and the Thirties (1987). Berryman and Halliday, both prep school boys, matriculated at Columbia in fall 1932 and first met in February 1933 when they crossed paths pursuing the same woman who was studying at Barnard. Lively and detailed, the memoir has many letters by Berryman; but the substantial loss is Berryman’s muted voice. Halliday’s own account skips fall 1932, 1933, and 1934, and gives a few letters for fall 1935 and spring 1936. (Halliday notes that their correspondence increased in fall 1934 when he transferred to the University of Michigan). Halliday’s memoir may provide readers with “the fullest picture of Berryman’s college years,” but those years are still full of holes.Berryman had a “natural love of study” (20) and Mark Van Doren at Columbia and George “Dadie” Rylands at Cambridge sparked and fanned his interest in textual criticism and Shakespeare, “that multiform & encyclopedic bastard” (Berryman 2000: xxxiv). There are glimpses in the letters of Berryman’s struggle to complete his critical edition of King Lear, but the editors suggest that those “readers interested in Berryman’s relationship with Shakespeare scholars like W. W. Greg and George Ian Duthie should consult Berryman’s Shakespeare (1999), which has a chapter of Berryman’s correspondence on King Lear” (4). That chapter, “Letters on Lear,” has the advantage of allowing readers to experience a different timbre of Berryman’s voice that only a correspondence offers.When D. D. Paige wrote about editing Ezra Pound’s correspondence, Berryman was glad such a book was to be done, but wrote, “I don’t envy you any part of it, the collection, the deciphering, or the annotation. . . . I don’t see how you can avoid annotation, and unhappily the more the better” (203). In Selected Letters, the editors have kept the annotations “short and factual” in the “interest of including as many letters as possible while still producing a single volume” (7). Most of the sequential 1,270 notes gathered just before the index are a line or two, sufficient for titles of books and articles. There are exceptions, as A. E. Housman preached, to every textual rule and “short” often feels like an unnecessary editorial short cut. Space is saved, but readers pay the price with their time searching elsewhere for context.“It is a wise father that knows his own child.” Shakespeare was the wisest and best of Berryman’s unofficial teachers and that line from The Merchant of Venice may have been on Berryman’s mind as several moments in the letters to his son make painfully aware: “I haven’t seen you in so long, I don’t know how you talk or what you can understand” (405). He tried to be a parent from a distance: “You must be a good boy—obeying your very good mother— . . . and with respect for your father, who has not been the most useless man in the present American world” (405). Many letters are apologetic about disappointments: getting the wrong date of a birthday; being unable to write because of exhaustion; composing parts of letters in his head but failing to write them down; too busy with poems to reply; canceling an afternoon together; canceling visits for lack of money and ill health; or for a letter’s tone: “I’ll write more cheerfully next time” (622). The last letter to Paul in the edition is two scant paragraphs written a month later on a Monday in late November 1971 with the valedictions “In haste,” and “love,” before he marched through the snow to listen to eighteen Honors students “misunderstand H. James’s novel The American” (623).Berryman (2021: 57) began writing verse “because I had to and have to. It’s what I do.” Even though the mature poet abandons and distances himself from early influences (for Berryman these were W. B. Yeats, W. H. Auden, and Rainer Maria Rilke), advice from Rilke’s Letters to a Young Poet reverberated within him:Berryman “sacrificed everything” (2021: 79), and many of his letters are its testament. His womanizing, his divorces, his alcoholism, his poor health: “My health’s been so nervous,” he confessed to Robert Giroux, “and I’ve been very unwillingly writing so much, that I finally had to go into hospital. . . . But I’ve done, I think it is, eighteen Dream Songs this winter & spring, without wanting to at all” (355). After sending an extensive version of The Dream Songs to New York for spring publication, he confided in Ann Levine that he felt dead, “if the exhausted & ill & depressed can also be dead” (492). Love & Fame was composed “in one volcanic outburst of 5 or 6 weeks just before (near prostration) I went into treatment” (570).Berryman sympathized with the scholar-poet A. E. Housman: “one of my heroes and always has been” (122) he told the Paris Review. For Housman (1933: 47), writing poetry was like a passive “secretion”: “I have seldom written poetry,” he wrote in The Name and Nature of Poetry, “unless I was rather out of health, and the experience, though pleasurable, was generally agitating and exhausting” (48). Again, to the Paris Review: “He was a detestable and miserable man. Arrogant, unspeakably lonely, cruel, and so on, but an absolutely marvelous minor poet, I think, and a great scholar. And I’m about equally interested in those two activities. In him they are perfectly distinct. You are dealing with an absolute schizophrenic. In me they seem closer together, but I just don’t know” (Berryman 2021: 122). Berryman died believing himself to be a scholar-poet, but his hazy introspection did not fool Mark Van Doren, who several months before Berryman’s death tried to separate the scholar from the poet. Berryman, the poet, had published ten books; the scholar, a critical biography of Stephen Crane and a coedited handbook on the arts of reading. “I have seldom known you wrong about anything,” Berryman shot back, “but you couldn’t be more wrong about me as a scholar. Mark, I am it, Dr Dryasdust in person” (608). His works-in-progress were legion: “I used to ascribe my lifelong failure to finishing anything to my 24-year-old alcoholism” (607), he admitted to Van Doren. “But I can’t buy that.” That one vice had been a front for a trinity of “capital vices” (608): “Some bone-laziness but mostly DOLDRUMS, proto-despair, great-poets-die-young or at least unfulfilled like Coleridge & Co., all that crap” (607–8); “the opposite, fantastic hysterical labour, accumulation, proliferation” (608); and “over-ambitiousness.” The first, he believed, “has ceased to exist”; the second, “is coming under control; my pedantry is much less self-indulgent, I drop things once I have their direction & velocity taped or sufficiently indicated for my immediate purpose.” “It’s the third,” he confessed, “that’s the problem.”Around this time, Berryman had also written to the President of the University of Minnesota: “I suddenly realized that I am dealing with seven unfinished books and have to have time free” (610), he pleaded. “Actually, I have seen since that it is even worse than that: there are thirteen books in question (not counting half a dozen abandoned forever), of which nine were begun at least fifteen to twenty to twenty-five years ago and many are very far advanced.” Later that month he wrote to his first wife, Eileen Simpson: “I am more or less giving up teaching—not resigning—but will do one seminar this fall” (616). His health had been improving, though still subject to moments of rage that would land him in the hospital. “Dry six months today,” he continued, “and I will value the pin my pals will give me tonight rather more than my great heavy Regents’ Professor medal or the National Bk Award or the honorary degree I picked up in Iowa last month.” But that twenty-four-year-old vice soon reappeared, and several months later Berryman jumped off the Washington Avenue Bridge that spans the Mississippi River and joins St. Paul with Minneapolis.",en

https://openalex.org/W4386930000,2023,History,"A New History of the American South ed. by W. Fitzhugh Brundage (review)Reviewed by: A New History of the American South ed. by W. Fitzhugh Brundage Matthew Hild (bio) A New History of the American South. Edited by W. Fitzhugh Brundage. (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2023. Pp. 616. $45.00 cloth) A New History of the American South, according to editor W. Fitzhugh Brundage, is the “first, collaborative effort to tell the history of the American South for the twenty-first century” (p. ix). The qualifier “collaborative” is crucial here; William A. Link’s Southern Crucible: The Making of an American Region (2015) is a noteworthy example of a single-author effort to tell that story. Edited volumes in Kent State University Press’s “Interpreting American History” series cover, to date, slavery, Reconstruction, and the New South, but not the history of the American South as comprehensively as this book does. Nevertheless, Brundage clearly states that the book is not intended to be an encyclopedic, comprehensive history of the region. Instead, the book examines certain themes, such as “repeated disruptive change in the history of the South,” “ongoing ethnic coexistence and exploitation,” and southern distinctiveness and identity, topics that Brundage has written about in his own work (pp. x, xiv). Part one of the book, which is divided into three parts, is titled “Precontact to the American Revolution.” In some ways, this section of the book does come off as being about as comprehensive as one could expect from a tome that is so ambitious in its scope. Coverage begins with the Paleoindian Period (14,000 B.C.E. –9,000 B.C.E.) and extends through the Revolutionary War Era. Agriculture, construction, politics, wars, religion, and the “ethnic coexistence and exploitation” that the introduction refers to all receive considerable coverage (p. xiv). Slavery draws much attention in part one and part two, “The Long Nineteenth Century,” which begins with Laura F. Edwards’ [End Page 181] “The South and the New Nation, 1783–1820” and ends with Scott Reynolds Nelson’s “The Bourbon South.” Edwards points to the southern founders, especially Thomas Jefferson, as helping lay the key groundwork for a selective, mythical version of the region’s history, “making the world [they] described . . . seem real, even when it had little to do with the actual past” (p. 168). Martha S. Jones emphasizes the role of Blacks in “The Age of Emancipation” (the title of chapter six). Kate Masur examines the mid-nineteenth-century path to the Civil War, and Gregory P. Downs examines the rise and fall of the Confederacy and Reconstruction. Nelson’s essay analyzes the “Bourbon” era that followed Reconstruction, with particular emphasis upon the career and writings of Atlanta’s prophet of the “New South creed,” Henry W. Grady. Part three, “The Twentieth Century,” is the longest of the three, with six essays. Collectively, they cover the rise and fall of Jim Crow, the contradictions of southern reform in the Progressive Era (and one of its most prominent and vexing figures, Thomas E. Watson of Georgia), the demise of the Democratic Party’s dominance of the region, the transformation of the southern economy, and religion (particularly evangelicalism) and culture (especially literature). These essays, and the book as a whole, effectively consider southern history within not only the national context but the global as well. Overall, this book delivers on its promise “to tell the history of the American South for the twenty-first century.” The essays deftly weave social, cultural, political, and economic history into cohesive narratives. The list of contributors (fifteen plus Brundage with his introduction) is a diverse one of well-respected historians, and, despite the large number of authors, the essays do not seem disjointed or disconnected. The extent to which endnotes are provided varies considerably across the essays; however, one contains no endnotes at all. The length of the book probably limits how many people will read it from cover to cover, but almost anyone interested in southern history should find at least some of the essays of interest as up-to-date and thorough examinations of their respective topics.

https://openalex.org/W4362472610,2023,History,"Special ReportBoarding increases stress on patients and pressure on staff and consumes scarce ED resourcesFigure: behavioral health, ED, EM, psychiatric patients, boarding, ACEP, American College of Emergency Physicians, EmPATH unitsOne ED had been boarding a psychiatric patient for five months. You read that right: “We now have a patient who has been boarding with us for over 5 MONTHS with no end in sight,” the emergency physician wrote. “She has injured herself on occasion, and has refused medications until she is so psychotic that she can't refuse them any longer.” Another said the ED had been boarding a 14-year-old girl for more than a month while awaiting inpatient psychiatric care. “Can you imagine being confined to a small room, without actually getting psychiatric care, for 42 days??? This could have been the subject of a Stephen King novel. Horrific,” the emergency physician wrote. Those examples came from a Nov. 7, 2022, letter that the American College of Emergency Physicians and 34 other medical societies sent to President Biden calling for collaboration on short- and long-term solutions to address ED boarding. The letter noted that “boarding of psychiatric patients in EDs is particularly prevalent, disproportionately affecting patients with behavioral health needs, who wait on average three times longer than medical patients because of significant gaps in our health care system.” (https://bit.ly/3YWVqEI.) “This situation is worse than ever, in part because of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it has been going on for 30 or 40 years,” said ACEP President Christopher S. Kang, MD, who is currently forming a task force to develop clinical recommendations on this issue. “It's become almost a tragic one-upmanship: ‘Oh, you have a psychiatric patient who's been boarding for five months? We have that beat, six months.’ ‘Oh, we've had one for nine months.’ “Our patients deserve better, and it takes an enormous toll on nurses, doctors, and staff,” he said. “There is such moral injury when we are not able to help our patients and no one else is willing or able to help us. It's going to take all the stakeholders, all of the emergency medicine organizations as well as psychiatric associations, government, insurers, and our individual members.” The Joint Commission also spotlighted the problem, noting that extended ED boarding for behavioral health patients increased psychological stress on patients who were already depressed or in psychotic states, delayed treatment that could mitigate the need for an inpatient stay, consumed scarce ED resources, and increased pressure on staff. (July 2021; http://bit.ly/3xsXuZm.) It said extended boarding also worsened ED crowding, lengthened wait times for all patients, and increased the use of ancillary support, such as security officers. It also pushed up the rates of patients who left without being seen, lengthened inpatient stays for those admitted, and had a significant financial impact on ED reimbursement. The problem dates back to the deinstitutionalization movement of the mid-20th century, said Kimberly Nordstrom, MD, an associate professor of clinical psychiatry at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. “The idea behind moving people with severe mental illness out of institutions and into the community was that there would be community-supported care and services, but funding has not fully supported that.” Each state is a little different, she said. Some have good services for people with behavioral health conditions, like substance disorders, developmental disabilities, and neuropsychiatric issues such as traumatic brain injury. Where there is a paucity of such services, Dr. Nordstrom said, it usually means that existing services say they can't help, and those people wind up in the ED. The Burden on Younger Patients Extended ED boarding can be particularly detrimental for children and adolescents with behavioral health issues, said Jennifer Wolff, PhD, an associate professor of psychiatry and human behavior at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, a staff psychologist at Rhode Island Hospital and Bradley hospitals, and the director of the Adolescent Mental Health Collaborative at Brown. Dr. Wolff and her colleagues found a threefold increase in the number of pediatric patients who boarded in their children's hospital ED over the past three years and a 60 percent increase in the average time spent boarding in the ED. (Adm Policy Ment Health. 2023 Jan 6;1; https://bit.ly/3KaUqJ0.) “ED clinicians are extremely dedicated and caring individuals doing their best to meet the needs of these kids, but given the volume of kids coming in and the lack of beds, they're not able to provide the kind of care they want to provide,” she said. “There are more of these kids than we can serve right now. They are at least in a safe environment, but they're not getting the direct psychological care that they need in a medical ED.” Dr. Wolff said care delayed further can also exacerbate existing problems. “For some of these kids who have really chronic psychopathology and are going to need long-term care, we run the risk of them having a negative experience that is so detrimental that it is a deterrent to them seeking care later on,” she said. “People are becoming aware that the system is broken and that we need to do more to serve these kids, but I wish there was more help coming faster.” Dr. Wolff's group at Brown is part of Youth Partners in Care for Suicide Prevention, a multicenter study funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute that will train emergency physicians and staff how to provide safety planning to decrease suicidality and help teens and young adults develop a plan to stay safe after leaving the ED. (http://bit.ly/3YSkc8Q.) The study employs a crisis therapy session in the ED to integrate safety within usual ED care and brief therapeutic follow-up after discharge. Evidence has shown benefit of the interventions, and the study will evaluate whether the latter is more effective than the first alone. A More EmPATHic Approach One of the most effective models for managing psychiatric emergencies in the ED is the Emergency Psychiatric Assessment, Treatment, and Healing unit. The brainchild of emergency physician Scott Zeller, MD, the vice president for acute psychiatry at Vituity and an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of California-Riverside. EmPATH units are scalable, patient-centered psychiatric emergency observation models. (http://bit.ly/3KcLjXZ.) “These are hospital-based outpatient programs which can promptly accept all medically-appropriate patients in a psychiatric crisis, even those on involuntary psychiatric detention,” Dr. Zeller said. “Rather than being an alternative-to-inpatient destination for ED mental health patients, the EmPATH unit is the destination for all the ED's acute mental health patients, a place where disposition decisions are typically not made until after a thorough psychiatric evaluation, treatment, and an observation period in the recuperative unit setting.” There are now several dozen EmPATH units across the United States, and Dr. Zeller projected that more than a hundred will be in place within the next few years. “You can set up an EmPATH unit in any hospital, any size, urban or rural, academic or community,” he said. “Because they require 24/7 support, nurses are the backbone of all EmPATH units. They also are staffed with psychiatrists, social workers, and trained peer supporters, who are almost like sponsors in AA.” Each EmPATH patient gets his own recliner in a central room, and is free to walk about, pace, or meditate. Snacks, beverages, and linens are provided, and patients can watch TV, play board games, or chat privately with a therapist or peer support counselor. The units also intermingle nurses, social workers, therapists, and peer support counselors, facilitating rapid, supportive management of escalating symptoms. Enclosed areas are available if a patient needs temporary privacy, and the units allow all patients to see a psychiatrist as quickly as possible and have treatment implemented promptly. “Overall, we find that 75 to 80 percent of the people who come in to EmPATH units who would have been boarding are discharged within 24 hours,” said Dr. Zeller, also a past chair of the Coalition on Psychiatric Emergencies and a past president of the American Association for Emergency Psychiatry. The EmPATH unit at the University of Iowa, for example, in its first year of operations, reduced ED length of stay prior to transfer to the EmPATH unit by 70 percent—from an average of 16.2 hours to 4.9 hours—and reduced inpatient psychiatric admissions from 57 percent to 27 percent. It also reduced 30-day psychiatric patient-returns to the ED by 25 percent, increased outpatient follow-up from 39.4 percent to 63.2 percent, and shortened inpatient LOS for those patients who are admitted. The unit also added $861,000 to the hospital's medical emergency department bottom line by moving psychiatric patients to a better care location and opening up ED beds for non-psychiatric patients, reducing sitter costs, and decreasing the number of patients who left without being seen. “In some places, we've seen people take old spaces, like an unused cardiac rehab area where the treadmills were, slap on a coat of paint, upgrade the plumbing to make it ligature-safe, and boom, they have an EmPATH unit,” said Dr. Zeller. “If you want to build something more elaborate from scratch, it will cost a bit more. But there is often support for these units. California, for example, is currently offering a $20 million grant program for hospitals in the state to create EmPATH units.” (https://bit.ly/3k08I4l.) Such units are also attractive to philanthropists. “As people recognize the mental health crisis in America,” he said, “it's a great opportunity to use charitable funds for something that has a real impact.” Even if you cannot create a separate EmPATH unit at your hospital, Dr. Zeller said the basics of the model can be adopted in any ED. His team created a program called Emergency Psychiatric Interventions, which won the 2021 Acute Care Suicide Prevention Award from ACEP and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. “EPI teaches the basics of good psychiatric triage, de-escalation and voluntary collaboration as well as initiating treatment on oral medications,” he said. “Scores of hospitals that use this approach now report great improvement in their metrics, and surveys say that their staff feel much safer.” Building Bridges Studies of prolonged ED boarding have found that the primary barrier to resolving many patients' cases is the lack of patient acceptance to inpatient psychiatric hospitals, community settings, or other housing. (Am J Emerg Med. 2021;46:550; https://bit.ly/3Is8IUa.) At Hasbro Children's and Bradley hospitals in Rhode Island, the Psychiatry Access, Continuity, and Evaluation (PACE) clinic provides just such a bridge for young people with behavioral health issues. Children were coming to the Hasbro ED in crisis and often leaving without services, said Mitchell Otu, MD, an emergency physician there and the clinical director for the PACE clinic. “PACE fills that gap,” he said. “Often, kids come to the ED and their situation is bad, but they don't necessarily need to be in the hospital, which comes with its own risks and benefits that don't necessarily balance out those risks. In that case, we do interventions and safety planning for interim management, such as securing medications and weapons. Then I will see them in the PACE clinic within a week to 10 days after they come out of the ED and as long as needed afterward until they can find a long-term provider.” Hasbro's interdisciplinary ED team of child psychiatry fellows, licensed behavioral health counselors, social workers, and nurse practitioners has the benefit of resources, including partial hospitalization and intensive outpatient programs that it can offer children and teens in behavioral health crisis. “It's been a long process of developing these programs, and it's still ongoing,” Dr. Otu said. Capacity problems in the ED are the result of many external factors, and Dr. Otu said they must be more intentional about building the workforce of mental health providers. “At present, we have a huge shortage of child psychiatrists,” he said. “Not only does there need to be concerted efforts to get a more diverse and larger group of people into child psychiatry, we need to also build out other career pipelines for treating children with behavioral health needs, including primary care providers, nurse practitioners, social workers, and psychologists.” He noted that Bradley Hospital has initiated a regional collaboration with other hospitals to help primary care providers manage youth in crisis. Dr. Kang, ACEP's president, said he is organizing a summit on the behavioral health boarding crisis. Other emergency medicine organizations and psychiatric groups have expressed interest in participating, and he is working to secure government representation.

https://openalex.org/W4319876709,2023,History,"IntroductionIn the fall of 1940, the German authorities of occupied Poland created a sealed district for the Jewish population in the capital of the so-called General Government.1 The Warsaw Ghetto was the largest ghetto in Nazi-occupied Europe; by April 1941, some 450,000 Jews were forced to live behind its walls. As a result of the Grosse Aktion, a ghetto-clearing operation carried out from July 22 to September 21, 1942, about 75 percent of the ghetto's inhabitants were deported and murdered in the Treblinka extermination camp.On April 19, 1943—eighty years ago now—an uprising broke out in the Warsaw Ghetto. One of the most important literary testimonies to the uprising is Hanna Krall's Zdążyć przed Panem Bogiem [Shielding the flame].2 There are three main thematic threads in this book, written in the form of an extended interview with Marek Edelman, the deputy commander of the uprising. The first is Edelman's story about deportations which the Nazis called “the resettlement of the population to the East” in an effort to disguise its true nature. Jewish militants at the time displayed posters with the warning: “Resettlement is death.” The assembly point for the deportations was the Umschlagplatz, located in the center of prewar Warsaw. The second thread of Krall's book is the story of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising and a group of insurgents from the Jewish Combat Organization (ŻOB), headed by Mordechai Anielewicz. The uprising lasted twenty days and ended in defeat. On May 16, 1943, the German troops set the ghetto on fire and demolished the Great Synagogue on Tłomackie Street. This action was personally led by SS General Jürgen Stroop. A few days earlier, the insurgents, including their commander, Anielewicz, had been surrounded in a bunker at 18 Miła Street. Most of them committed suicide there. Only a few managed to get out of the bunker and cross to the so-called Aryan side. The third thread, and the leitmotif of Krall's book, focuses on the traumatic memories of Dr. Edelman who became a well-known cardiologist after the war.The most complete record of the experience of the Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto is the monumental Emanuel Ringelblum Archive. The original documents were placed in metal containers and buried in the ghetto. Some of the containers were recovered after the war and the materials they held were deposited in the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw. In 1999, UNESCO placed the archive in the Memory of the World Program. Before World War II, Emanuel Ringelblum (1900–1944), a Polish-Jewish historian and activist, was a member of the Historical Section and the Commission for the History of Jews in Poland, a Warsaw-based agency of the Yiddish Scientific Institute in Vilnius (YIVO). During the war, he launched the clandestine Oneg Shabbat (Oyneg Shabes) Archive in the Warsaw Ghetto to collect documentation about the experience of the Polish Jews under Nazi occupation. As Jacek Leociak notes: The materials collected in the Underground Archive of the Warsaw Ghetto are an invaluable historical source, but they are also a testimony to the experience of the Holocaust, understood in moral and existential terms. They bear witness to an experience that is radically new, in the face of which previous forms of expression fail and language seems helpless.3In late 2021 and early 2022, archaeological work began on the site of the former Warsaw Ghetto (now the Muranów district), at the location of the insurgents’ bunker at 18 Miła Street. This project is coordinated by the Warsaw Ghetto Museum, Christopher Newport University and Aleksander Gieysztor Academy in Pułtusk, the Historic Preservation Office of the Mazowsze Region (represented by Professor Jakub Lewicki), and a rabbinical commission appointed by Michael Schudrich, Chief Rabbi of Poland. Using such modern methods as geo-radar surveys, the project is expected to uncover one of the major sites of Holocaust memory in Europe.4The articles collected in this special issue of The Polish Review—under the title Lessons from the Archive: Rereading Accounts from and about the Warsaw Ghetto—present little-known materials and engage an interdisciplinary framework of humanistic understanding, founded on the belief in the irreducible dignity of men and women and in the efficacy and worth of human freedom and hence also of human responsibility (to use Maria Janion's terminology). The voices of scholars of life-writing (Anita Jarczok) and Hebrew literature (Marta Dudzik-Rudkowska) join those of a literary historian (Sławomir Buryła), a Miłosz scholar (Marek Bernacki), and a scholar of nineteenth- and twentieth-century theatre and drama (Halina Filipowicz).The special issue opens with Anita Jarczok's article on Rachela Auerbach's ghetto diary which she kept at Ringelblum's request. Written mainly in Polish and covering the period from August 1941 to July 1942, Auerbach's journal is little known in the United States, as it has not been translated into English in its entirety. Jarczok analyzes Auerbach's distinct, original literary style and contextualizes her journal by considering other autobiographical accounts written in the Warsaw Ghetto, such as the diaries of Chaim Aron Kaplan and Abraham Levin.The sermons of Rabbi Kalonimus Kalman Shapiro from Piaseczno, addressed to the ghettoized Jewish community in Warsaw, are the subject of Marta Dudzik-Rudkowska's article. To understand the wartime writings of the Piaseczno rabbi, who was killed by the Germans in the Trawniki labor camp in April 1943, she approaches his sermons as a special kind of personal document. Focusing on how Rabbi Shapiro sought answers to the difficult questions troubling his fellow Jews during the dark days of the Holocaust, she analyzes his use of tropes that are characteristic of traditional biblical rabbinic exegesis, such as the motifs of the exodus from Egypt and Moses’ leadership.Sławomir Buryła, co-editor of a major publication, Literatura polska wobec Zagłady (1939–1968) [Polish literature on the Holocaust],5 provides an overview of the most important works of Polish poetry, prose fiction, and drama on the subject of the Warsaw Ghetto, written between the mid-1940s and 2000. Along the way, he identifies recurrent motifs in this rich body of literature. The American reader deserves an explanation of the origins of the metaphorical term “the Columbus generation,” used by Buryła. The term draws on the title of Roman Bratny's famous and widely read 1957 novel, Kolumbowie, rocznik 20 [The Columbus generation of 1920], that describes the fate of the first generation of men and women born and raised in free Poland after the restoration of independence in 1918. The term is well-established in Polish literary discourse.6In my article, I discuss five little-known texts by Czesław Milosz from 1946–1968. They were published only in 2020, in a volume entitled Z archiwum. Wybór publicystyki z lat 1945–2004 [From the archive: Selected journalistic writings, 1945–2004]. The article analyzes Miłosz's statements concerning the Holocaust, with particular emphasis on the Warsaw Ghetto uprising. My aim is to present Miłosz not only as an eyewitness to the Holocaust and a firm opponent of antisemitism but also as a moral witness. I argue that his testimonies in the form of poems, essays, and journalism create a community of memory, while also expressing his empathy and solidarity with the victims of genocidal violence.In the closing article, Halina Filipowicz develops a new interpretation of Miłosz's only play, Prolog [Prologue], written in occupied Warsaw in late 1942. She structures her argument around Miłosz's metaphor of ruins. Her analysis of Miłosz's dramaturgical, stylistic, and rhetorical strategies enables her to demonstrate that in this “compact, at times enigmatic play, the Holocaust seems to be nowhere, while in fact it is everywhere.” In reclaiming Prologue for Holocaust literary studies, she argues that the play is an essential text in the history of Holocaust memory and an early contribution to debates about the conundrum of aesthetic pleasure in literary representations of what happened to the Jews during World War II.The articles gathered in this special issue of The Polish Review offer, each in its own way, existential, ethical, and religious reflections on the trauma, memory, and representation of the Holocaust. Methodologically, this cluster of articles draws on the cultural theory of literature, and especially Ryszard Nycz's idea of the poetics of experience.7As the editor of the special issue, I would like to share a brief reflection of a personal nature. In 1987, when I was twenty-two years old and a third-year student of Polish philology at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków, I read with great interest as well as apprehension an essay by my mentor, Professor Jan Błoński—“Biedni Polacy patrzą na getto” [The poor Poles look at the ghetto], first published in Tygodnik Powszechny on 11 January 1987. For me, his essay became an ethical imperative to face painful truths about the past. The fact that I write about these issues here and in my contribution to the special issue is no accident. I remember Professor Błoński's words well: We must stop haggling, trying to defend and justify ourselves. [. . .] We must say first of all—Yes, we are guilty. We did take Jews into our home, but we made them live in the cellar. [. . .] [I]f only we had behaved more humanely in the past, had been wiser, more generous, then genocide would perhaps have been “less imaginable,” would probably have been considerably more difficult to carry out, and almost certainly would have met with much greater resistance than it did. To put it differently, it would not have met with the indifference and moral turpitude of the society in whose full view it took place.8I would like to extend my sincere thanks to Irena Grudzińska-Gross, the author of the inspiring book Czesław Miłosz i długi cień wojny [Czesław Miłosz and the long shadow of war, 2020], and the anonymous readers of the articles for their very helpful comments and suggestions.",en

https://openalex.org/W4313855643,2023,History,"The Critical Reception of Mark Twain's Introduction to <i>English as She is Taught</i>Caroline B. Le Row (1844–1914), a teacher in the Brooklyn public schools, wrote Mark Twain in December 1886 that she lived “in a state of chronic and impotent rage at the process going on every hour of every day in nearly every school—ancient and modern swill ladled by the gallon into the pint cups of children's brains and crammed down with the handle.”1 To prove the point, Le Row enclosed a manuscript listing silly mistakes and malapropisms high school English students across the country had made in their recitations and examinations, including such hilarious blunders as these: Aborigines, a system of mountains.Ammonia, the food of the gods.Auriferous, pertaining to an orifice.Demogogue, a vessel containing beer and other liquids.Equestrian, one who asks questions.Eucharist, one who plays euchre.Franchise, anything belonging to the French.Republican, a sinner mentioned in the Bible.She was very quick at repertoire.He prayed for the waters to subsidize.A verb is something to eat.The Middle Ages come in between antiquity and posterity.Chaucer was the father of English pottery.2Le Row expressed the hope that the “compilation might be somehow made a two-edged sword of the spirit for educational reform” of the rote instruction common in the public schools3 and she asked Twain whether he thought “it ought to be published or not.”4On his part, Twain was so enamored with the “darling literary curiosity”5 that he persuaded Le Row to change its title from “Teaching the Young Idea” to “English as She is Taught.” More to the point, he offered to write an advance review of it for Century that she might then reprint as an introduction to the published edition. She was stunned by his generosity. “Your surprising and magnificent offer,” she replied, “has overwhelmed me with gratitude.”6 Twain quoted over half of the 4274 words in his notice directly from Le Row's English as She is Taught. On February 10, 1887, three weeks before its publication, he read the review at the Stationers’ Board of Trade Dinner in New York. He facetiously blamed the stationers “for selling the nonsensical school books from which parrot rules [of grammar] are drummed into children” and underscored “how much teaching has really been done and how much is worthless cramming.”7 The journalist Eleanor Kirk averred that the speech not only included “several side-splitting quotations” but “had the effect of stirring up considerable discussion in reference to the cramming process of our public schools.”8 Le Row immediately congratulated Twain on his success and reported she had been told that “you were never so funny in your life! . . . You have fired a blast which will reverberate through a whole century (‘beating all hollow’ Emerson's famous shot ‘heard round the world’) and I intend to keep up the firing all along the line.”9Twain read the essay twice more in public prior to its publication in the April 1887 number of the Century. At the Longfellow Memorial Fund meeting at the Boston Museum the afternoon of March 31, Charles Eliot Norton, professor of art history at Harvard, introduced Twain to the capacity crowd and invited him to offer a sip of his “precious, patent champagne-mandragora,” whereupon Twain “sauntered up to the little desk behind the footlights” and read selections from his review “showing some of the curious errors, with underlying truths in them made by school children.”10 The Boston Globe stated that he spoke “just as an old smoker would smoke a good cigar, dwelling long and lovingly on the aromatic parts, giving out the nicotine of mirth in great puffs.”11 According to the New York Tribune, Twain was “enthusiastically received” and “as usual irresistibly funny,”12 especially when he read from his article that Oliver Wendell Holmes was “a most profligate and humorous writer.” On the stage Holmes “was seen swaying and shaking with convulsions of merriment.”13 To judge from all accounts of these performances, Twain stuck to his script, adlibbing only once at the Longfellow benefit. “The first conscientious Congress met in Philadelphia,” he read from his review before adding, “and perhaps the last.”14 Though “humorous in tone,” the Boston Post added, Twain's recitation raised “serious considerations regarding the value of much that is called education in these times.”15 He spoke that evening before a capacity audience in the Common Pleas Courtroom at the New Haven City Hall and the New Haven Journal and Courier dubbed the event “An Evening with Clemens and His Hodgepodge of Fun.”16Twain's essay appeared on newsstands the next day—April Fool's Day—whereupon excerpts from it were widely syndicated in the U.S. and the U.K.17 Twain read the entire article aloud a final time before the cadets in the mess hall at West Point on April 30. Escorted by William M. Postlethwaite, chaplain and professor of history and law, Twain aroused “roars of laughter,” particularly when he read the line “There were donkeys in the Theological Seminary.” The Army and Navy Journal claimed that the line “was so indescribably funny” that the cadets “continued to laugh and applaud for fully five minutes.”18 When Postlethwait stood and bowed, Twain turned and assured him “nothing personal” was meant.19Meanwhile, the Century editors had sent Le Row proof of Twain's essay in mid-February. She thought it “capital,”20 though she also revised it slightly, removing “what she thought reflected unpleasantly” on teachers.21 Notoriously prickly about any unauthorized changes to his manuscripts prior to their publication, Twain acquiesced to Le Row's emendations because, as she explained, “It will never do for teachers to be held responsible for the existing atrocious state of things. As well blame the sailors for shipwreck who faithfully follow the orders of their captain. ‘Where the offense is let the great axe fall.’ It is the ‘Boards’ (woodenheads, oftentimes), the ‘Trustees,’ the ‘Committees’ who lay out the work.” Twain dutifully accepted Le Row's correction. The published essay contains this sentence: “If a laugh is fair here, not the struggling child, but the unintelligent teacher—or rather the unintelligent Boards, Committees, and Trustees—are the proper target for it.”22 In addition, Twain forwarded the $250 (approximately three-months of a teacher's salary or some $7250 in modern dollars) that he was paid for the essay to Le Row, and she appreciated the present. “I do not accept the check as my right or due in any sense,” she wrote him, “but as a most generous gift from you which I fully appreciate and for which I most sincerely thank you.”23 Twain's gesture was widely publicized, one editorialist declaring that should “he run for School Commissioner in Brooklyn . . . he would have all the teachers working at the polls for him.”24 Le Row's pamphlet was finally published by Cassell and Company of New York in mid-April 1887 and by London by T. Fisher Unwin of London in late May. By August 1 it had sold over five thousand copies and earned Le Row almost three hundred dollars in royalties.25The implications and importance of Twain's sociolinguistic study (though he would not have hung such a technical term on it) occasioned a fierce debate among reviewers. Many of them focused on the question whether it was a satirical comment on the failures of American public education or merely a weird comic spoof—that is, whether or not Twain wrote it with a deliberate “moral purpose.” On the one hand, some critics acknowledged its humor but focused on its underlying message. In the April 1887 number of the Century, the same issue in which his essay first appeared, the author of the “Topics of the Times” column opined that while it was “amusing” the “thoughtful reader” should also be dismayed: “Undoubtedly many of these children have been poorly taught and poorly taught in the same way, but the trouble lies back of indifferent teachers and even back of indifferent or ambitious school boards. It rests upon us all as a people” for failing to demand more accountability for their mediocre education.26 The Saint Paul Globe echoed the thought: “No thoughtful reader can read Mr. Clemens’ humorous article without being impressed with a feeling of dismay at the lack of thoroughness in our system of public instruction. . . . The results of this cramming educational process are humorously presented by Mr. Clemens, and yet through all his inimitable humor can be seen a faithful and sorrowful portraiture of the defects of our educational system.”27 Likewise, the Saint Paul Pioneer Press cautioned that the howlers Twain cited “ought not only amuse the public” but “point a moral.”28 The Philadelphia Inquirer agreed that the “mass of absurdities” Le Row had gathered were “undoubtedly genuine” and that Twain's inference—“that pupils in the public schools are too often loaded with “rules” which they are never taught to apply—is a legitimate one.”29 The Wilmington News emphasized the “dismal side to the fun in the reflection that these parrot-like and senseless appeals to memory” are the result of the “cram” method of public instruction.30 The New Orleans Times-Democrat reiterated that “despite its laughter-provoking quality,” the evidence Le Row and Twain marshalled “of the ignorance, stupidity, and incompetence of public school scholars” was “absolutely pathetic in its grotesqueness and constitutes a pitiable showing of the inadequacy of the public school system.”31 Three major newspapers in Lincoln, Nebraska, even “respectfully but firmly” insisted that the members of the local school board read Twain's article because he “very effectively illustrates what is the matter with the alleged teaching of English grammar in our own schools.”32Several reviewers in Great Britain were also attuned to Twain's purpose. For example, as the Salisbury and Winchester Journal declared, “It is well enough to laugh at these funny mistakes of the struggling scholar; but it is more profitable to inquire how they came to be made.”33 Appalled by the evidence Twain marshalled “of the manner in which young minds are not fed but crammed and choked,” the Saturday Review advised his readers to “stifle the laughter” and ask “how long our educators are going to be satisfied with the mechanical kind of teaching which is now in vogue.”34 Ditto the Publishers’ Circular: Fun or no fun, Mark Twain's article again throws light upon the evils of the cramming system now in vogue in English as well as American schools. This cramming is especially noticeable in the study of literature. . . . Many a laugh will ring out over the pages of Mark Twain's latest effusion, but there is another side to the question which should commend itself to the notice of the upbringers and guardians of youth.35The North-Eastern Weekly Gazette similarly noted that while the examination answers “might waken laughter in the gloomiest pessimist” they also “confirm the pessimist's views about the efficacy of teaching. The children who give these answers know literally nothing.”36 Le Row was gratified by “the row” she and Twain “kicked up,” as she wrote Twain in late April. She only hoped “that the dust raised so far is but the beginning of the trouble. How can I ever thank you for what you have done not only for me personally but in this most holy crusade?”37On the other hand, a variety of reviewers contended that nothing in Twain's “amusing” or “entertaining” essay should be taken seriously. The Boston Globe (“a rich source of pure humor”), Baltimore Sun (“richest humor”), London Morning Post (“delightful”), Leeds Mercury (“unpremeditatedly funny answers”), and Antrim Northern Whig (“full of quaint drollery”) failed even to acknowledge the possibility it served an ulterior purpose.38 Read solely in the context of his reputation as a humorist, that is, Twain's article was merely a humorous essay. Despite Twain's assurance that all the student responses in Le Row's book were genuine, that “none of them have been tampered with or doctored in any way,”39 a number of commentators questioned their authorship, some even suggesting that Twain had invented all the funny answers and that anyone who thought “English as She is Taught” a social critique was the victim of a hoax akin to “A Bloody Massacre Near Carson” (1863).Foremost among this clique of critics, ironically, was Twain's friend Thomas Wentworth Higginson, who had been in the audience when Twain read his essay at the Longfellow benefit in Boston on March 31. Higginson mused in his review of it a month later in Harper's Bazar that Twain was “eminently a humorist who enjoys his own jokes, and surely the crowning enjoyment of his life was when he looked through the newspapers the day after his ‘English as She is Taught’ appeared in the Century. From the grave editor” of the Centuryto the conductor of the smallest country newspaper, every soul fell into the trap and felt bound to point a moral against our long-suffering school system. . . . That these [bits of fun] should be seriously taken for childish blunders shows how easily people get away from the mental habits of their own childhood. This is not naïve and unintentional wit, but is overt, deliberate, experienced; not the delicious childish blundering but something concocted with malice aforethought; not the product of immaturity but of maturity,though the “extremely amusing” answers Twain ostensibly concocted “may have here and there imbedded” in them “something actually said by a child.”40 An anonymous writer in the Pittsburgh Post soon replied to Higginson's assertion that Twain had “invent[ed] every line” in the essay. “I saw this book put together a little at a time by the teacher mentioned, and that every line was taken from actual examination papers. And also that Mark Twain has not changed a line nor added one. What will Mr. Higginson say now?”41Of course, this exchange failed to quell the controversies swirling about the purpose and the authorship of the essay. The Hartlepool Northern Daily Mail conceded that Twain might have indicted rote learning in the public schools but that his “primary object” was “to make men laugh.”42 Other reviewers allowed that the implications of Twain's article were alarming, but only if the dubious accuracy of his citations could be verified. “If the work be what it purports to be—the actual mistakes of pupils,” the San Francisco Chronicle editorialized, for example, “it shows more clearly than anything that has ever been printed the vices of the public-school system of instruction,” which “crams the child-mind with facts which it cannot assimilate any more than a three-months’-old baby can digest a beefsteak.” But “it will take more faith than most people possess to believe that the answers” in Twain's “amusing article” are genuine.43 Twain's article “is amusing,” the Indianapolis Journal elsewhere allowed, “but would be more so were it not for the impression made on the reader that the ‘mistakes’ were perpetrated by the humorist himself rather than by the children of the schools.”44 According to the Topeka Lance, “Mark Twain's queer compilation of ridiculous blunders made by school children” was “of such a funny kind that one must seriously doubt” such a collection had “been made and half suspect that it is but another turn of Twain's humor.”45 The Woolwich Gazette quipped that some of the “side-splitting” quotations in Twain's essay were “so extraordinary that one is almost inclined to doubt the[ir] authenticity”46 While Twain claimed to cite authentic student answers, the Northern Christian Advocate alleged he only pretended to vouch “for the genuineness of the contents.” That is, he designed the essay “merely to provoke laughter” and “succeeded.”47 The Michigan Moderator was even more skeptical of Twain's intent: Mark Twain must enjoy to the fullest of his fun-loving capacity the serious way in which some papers take his compilation of absurdities. . . . How he must revel in mirth as he sees the solemn sermons preached on the subject of our public schools. It has always been a little difficult to tell Twain's truths from his lies, but these were so plainly marked in the article referred to that no one should err. But some people had a sermon all written and jumped eagerly to find a text to hitch it to.48The Brooklyn Eagle charged that many of Twain's “sham samples” were “not the errors of childhood” but of “self-confident ambition,” that members of the Union League and University club had wagered “on the genuine or sham character of those remarkable samples,” and that Twain would “make money out of the doubt which prevails, for he makes money out of everything relating to himself—and keeps it, too”49—his despite the fact that he had signed the $250 check he received for the essay over to Le Row.Still other critics quibbled with Twain's conclusions, blaming not the system of rote learning for the mistakes of children but the failures of the adults administering the exams. According to the Akron Summit County Beacon, Twain's article had merely established “that there are some dull pupils in the public schools; and the additional fact, possibly, that children are often asked questions which are beyond their age, and therefore that the fool was the questioner and not the child.”50 Not only is the reader “left in doubt as to who is the real author” of Twain's essay, the San Francisco Bulletin avowed, but the very questions the children purportedly answered were as “idiotic” as real questions “frequently used to drive young and uninstructed children to despair.”51 Similarly, the Portsmouth, England, Hampshire Telegraph observed that the “answers alleged to have been made by [the] pupils” were “sometimes almost as foolish” as “the questions of the examiners”;52 and the St. Johnsbury, Vt., Caledonian warned that “before the reader laughs too heartily over the absurdity of some of these answers he would do well to try his hand at answering them or similar questions on the spur of the moment.”53 The Ulster, Northern Ireland, Gazette blamed incompetent teaching for the student gaffes (“the mistakes of the pupil are often as attributable to the teacher who does not know how to teach”), the exact opposite conclusion Le Row and Twain hoped readers would reach.54 Ironically, the Lancaster, Pa., Semi-Weekly New Era rallied to the defense of the teachers Twain had ostensibly defamed and blamed their “stupid pupils”: “To say that Mark Twain's article is not eminently readable is untrue” but “to admit that it is a correct picture” is quite as far from the truth. . . . The most painstaking and competent teacher in the world cannot prevent stupid pupils from uttering blundering answers to questions. . . . To hold teachers responsible, therefore, for the amusing, meaningless and ridiculous answers children between the ages of six to twelve years may make concerning subjects they but faintly comprehend is to the full as silly as anything we find in “English as She is Taught,” and ungenerous and unjust as well. . . . That there are defects in the American system of school instruction—if we have what can be called a system—is undeniable. But that it turns out regularly and continually the kind of grist quoted in Twain's “English as She is Taught” is untrue and is besides a slander upon a profession which in the aggregate leads all others in intelligence and conscientious devotion to ill-requited duty.55On an entirely unique note, the New Hartford, Conn., Tribune minimized the significance of Twain's “delightfully amusing article” on the grounds that it contained nothing out of the ordinary: “any intelligent child under, say, fifteen years of age, will occasionally make a quaintly ridiculous error in the use of his mother tongue.”56Oscar Wilde discovered yet another reason to praise Twain's essay—not the laughable answers of students to the silly questions of teachers but the precocious wisdom the children betrayed in their responses. On April 13, 1887, less than two weeks after the April issue of Century with Twain's article in it was issued in the U.S., Wilde asked the editors of the Court and Society Review in London, “Shall I do for you an article called the ‘Child Philosopher’? It will be on Mark Twain's amazing and amusing record of the answers of American children at a Board School.”57 To be sure, Twain had noted in “English as She is Taught” how often “we do slam right into the truth” in the student answers “without even expecting it.”58 In his unsigned review of Twain's review, Wilde elaborated on this point. “Mr. Mark Twain's fascinating article,” he maintained, throws an entirely new light on that enfant terrible of a commercial civilisation, the American child, and reminds us that we may all learn wisdom from the mouths of babes and sucklings. For the mistakes by the interesting pupils of the American Board-Schools are not mistakes springing from ignorance of life or dullness of perception; they are, on the contrary, full of the richest suggestion and pregnant with the very highest philosophy.For example, Wilde declared that “the description of the Plagiarist [‘a writer of plays'] is the most brilliant thing that has been said on modern literature for some time.” Wilde expressed the hope “that when the next bevy of beauties land on our shores from American, they will bring with them one specimen at least of the native school boy. For many of his utterances are obviously mystical and possess that quality of absolute unintelligibility that is the peculiar privilege of the verbally inspired.” He concluded that “Twain deserves our warmest thanks for bringing to light the true American genius. American patriots are tedious, American millionaires go bankrupt, and American beauties don't last, but the schoolboy seems to be eternally delightful.”59Twain returned to his review of English as She is Taught while writing Following the Equator (1897), his final travelogue. In chapter LXI, he quotes extensively from a book entitled Indo-Anglian Literature that, like Le Row's pamphlet a decade earlier, was “well stocked” with “baboo” English “acquired in the schools” of India. “Some of it is very funny—,” he noted, “almost as funny, perhaps, as what you and I produce when we try to write in a language not our own.” He compared excerpts from it with some of the excerpts he had cited from Le Row in “English as She is Taught” to “show that when the American pupil is using but one language, and that one his own, his performance is no whit better than his Indian brother's.”60Twain's essay was reprinted with minor changes no less than four times over the next few years—as a slightly revised introduction to a reprint of Le Row's pamphlet issued by the Mutual Book Company of Boston in 1900; an abridged ten-cent “Cornhill Booklet” issued in March 1901 in Boston under the title “English as She is Instructed”; and introductions to reprints of Le Row's book issued by the Century Company in 1901 and 1905. It was one of Twain's most popular essays and it inspired a host of imitators, though he never reprinted it in a volume of his own collected stories and essays. With the exception of the 1901 reprintings, however, critics ignored these releases and reviewers of the 1901 issues broke little new ground. The Brooklyn Eagle again refused to admit “that Mark Twain could have edited these gems without adding or altering a word” but conceded that his essay was “in reality a ferocious satire on the absurd and foolish presumption of so-called civilization with its barren, mechanical, useless teachings” and was so funny it “would make a horse laugh.”61 Most of reviewers acknowledged the satirical purpose of the article: e.g., the St. Louis Republic (“drawing deductions as to the correctness of the teaching methods employed”), New York Tribune (condemns “what Mark Twain calls in his introduction to the book ‘brickbat culture’—cramming with obscure and wordy rules”), Phillipsburg, Kans., Dispatch (“denounce[s] many of the school methods, such as cramming children's memory”), Wilmington Journal (“the lesson those answers impress is that we are wasting much valuable time in teaching”), and Baltimore Sun (“a needed protest against the attempt to cram the memories of school children with information”).62 The Trenton Times again blamed not the students but “the school authorities, who believe in cramming pupils.”63 Only the Lancaster, Pa., Inquirer proposed a new scapegoat: “the textbooks furnished as the teachers’ implements.” In other words, the Inquirer indicted “authors and publishers—to which two classes the humorous Mark belongs.”64A final note: On January 23, 1897, the Brooklyn Eagle carried an Associated Press wire report that Mark Twain had filed for bankruptcy.65 The following day, Caroline Le Row wrote Twain to thank him again for his “immense kindness” in 1887. “You not only named my little book,” she remembered, “but you gave me the money . . . the Century paid you for making it famous. More than all you assured me a literary reputation which has been profitable to me ever since.” She closed by asking for “the great privilege of returning to you” the $250 he had given her—“your own money, really.”66 There is no evidence that, despite his straitened circumstances, Twain granted the request.",en
https://openalex.org/W4388635209,2023,History,"A Revolution of the Screw: Peripheralising Europe‘Where is your “home” moreover now – what has become of it?’ Can the documents of the west, Walter Benjamin's famous ‘documents of civilization’, help us to understand and articulate the peripheralisation, the provincialisation, of the west?1 If we are at a moment, as Hamid Dabashi has recently put it, at which ‘“Europe” […] has exhausted its epistemic possibilities and has now positively imploded into itself’, can a European literary and cultural tradition shed any light on this implosion, or look to a refigured global scene that emerges from it?2 I will address this question here by attending to a faint echo that can be heard, passing between two of Henry James's later novels, The Ambassadors (1903) and The Golden Bowl (1904), an echo that reaches to our own time, and to the contemporary moment at which we are required to assess, again, the relation between barbarism and civilisation. Much have I travell'd in the realm of gold, And many goodly states and kingdoms seen; Round many western isles have I been Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold. Oft of one wide expanse had I been told That deep-brow'd Homer ruled as his demesne; Yet did I never breathe its pure serene Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold: Then I felt like some watcher of the skies When a new planet swims into his ken; Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes He star'd at the Pacific – and all his men Look'd at each other with a wild surmise – Silent, upon a peak in Darien.3 As soon as [Balboa] beheld the South Sea stretching in endless prospect below him, he fell on his knees, and lifting up his hands to Heaven, returned thanks to God, who had conducted him to a discovery so beneficial to his country, and so honourable to himself. His followers, observing his transports of joy, rushed forward to join in his wonder, exultation and gratitude. They held on their course to the shore with great alacrity, when Balboa advancing up to the middle in the waves with his buckler and sword, took possession of that ocean in the name of the king his master, and vowed to defend it, with these arms, against all his enemies.7 Her shawl and Chad's overcoat and her other garments, and his, those they had each worn the day before, were at the place, best known to themselves – a quiet retreat enough, no doubt – at which they had been spending the twenty-four hours, to which they had fully meant to return that evening, from which they had so remarkably swum into Strether's ken. (TA 424) This is a glancing reference to Keats's sonnet, but its significance deepens, as Adrian Poole, Bart Eeckhout, and Gert Buelens have noted, when this moment in The Ambassadors finds an echo in a related moment in The Golden Bowl.10 Keats's sonnet stirs in The Ambassadors at the critical moment of Strether's discovery, and it is at a similarly significant turning point in The Golden Bowl that the sonnet appears again, this time much more forcibly. The Golden Bowl, like The Ambassadors, is concerned, above all, with the relation between America and Europe, and with the means by which an emerging American culture draws on and reconstitutes a European aesthetic, political, and intellectual history. Strether is the figure, in The Ambassadors, for this hinge or fulcrum between two cultural powers – dominance passing from the Old World to the New, as westward the course of empire makes its way. As Adrian Poole has pointed out, Strether's name suggests his predicament, his being stretched between one structure of knowing and the other – a stretching which, as Clare Pettitt has suggested, runs against the opposite experience of tethering which is also carried in Strether's name.11 In The Golden Bowl, the figure for this transfer of cultural power is the unimaginably wealthy art collector Adam Verver, whose name suggests not stretching or tethering but veering (with perhaps a distant echo of Melville's Captain Vere, another veerer).12 The adultery plot around which the novel turns – Adam Verver and his daughter Maggie are each married to rarefied specimens (the beautiful American Charlotte Stant and the Italian nobleman Prince Amerigo respectively), who, we are led to understand, are having an affair with each other – is orchestrated by Verver through his activities as a collector of European art. Verver purchases Prince Amerigo for his daughter, as a kind of gift, as he purchases Charlotte as a gift for himself. He regards them both as what he calls ‘human acquisitions’, and consistently describes Amerigo as a fine artwork, a rarity of exquisite old European provenance.13 ‘You’re round, my boy’, Verver says to Amerigo, as he is preparing to betroth him to Maggie. ‘You’re inveterately round in the detail. It's the sort of thing in you one feels – or at least I do – with one's hand’ (GB 126). Verver weighs Amerigo in his hand like a connoisseur, assessing his aesthetic quality, at one point, as if he were the artefact of the title, the crystal golden bowl. ‘You’re a pure and perfect crystal’, he says to Amerigo, who replies, with a peculiar knowing irony, that ‘if I'm a crystal I'm delighted I am a perfect one, for I believe they sometimes have cracks and flaws – in which case they’re to be had cheap!’ (127). He had, like many other persons, in the course of his reading, been struck with Keats's sonnet about stout Cortez in the presence of the Pacific; but it was probable that few persons had so devoutly fitted the poet's grand image to a fact of experience. It consorted so with Mr. Verver's consciousness of the way in which at a given moment he had stared at his Pacific that a couple of perusals of the immortal lines had sufficed to stamp them in his memory. His ‘peak in Darien’ was the sudden hour that had transformed his life, the hour of his perceiving with a mute inward gasp akin to the low moan of apprehensive passion that a world was left to him to conquer and that he might conquer it if he tried. (128) This is a peculiarly flexible passage, in which the revolutions of the intellectual plane turn both ways. Cortés's (or Balboa's) passage westwards to the Pacific leads to the European colonisation of the Americas, leading in turn to the amassing of American wealth, which allows Verver to establish his own empire, the founding of his museum in his fictional home town of ‘American City’. This westward movement, though, allows Verver to see that his own Pacific lies not to his west, but to his east. The world that is left to him to conquer is the world from which those explorers, Balboa and Cortés, originally set sail – the world of Keats's golden realm, and Homer's. The revolution of the intellectual plane, the discovery that a future can be summoned from an encounter with the past, that a new planet might be born from the discovery of an old one, that the ‘endless prospect’ of the Pacific might be found once more in the Mediterranean, feels to Verver like the ‘turning of the page of the book of life’ which made ‘such a stir of the air as sent up into his face the very breath of the golden isles’ (GB 128). The air of Keats, of Chapman, of Homer is released from the imaginary turned page, the turn of the intellectual plane, and feeds Verver's new passion, so, he says, to ‘rifle the Golden Isles had become on the spot the business of his future’ (128). This turning, like the turns of James's earlier exploration of double-jointed being in The Turn of the Screw, supplies the principle of relation, of attachment, in The Golden Bowl, and in The Ambassadors. It determines Strether's relations with Madame de Vionnet and Chad on the one hand, and with Mrs Newsome on the other. It is there in every bodily attitude, every angle of incidence, in The Golden Bowl. It is palpable at the close of the narrative, as Adam Verver prepares to leave London and his beloved daughter in order to return to American City with Charlotte, thus breaking up her affair with Amerigo. In the closing moments of the novel, Adam Verver and Maggie step out of the ‘great eastward drawing-room’ (GB 585) of Maggie's house onto the balcony overlooking the street – leaving Amerigo and Charlotte to share a silent farewell in the great, golden room that has already begun to grow dark. Together father and daughter look west, over the street, and past that towards the Atlantic, and towards the America to which Verver is about to return. But then they ‘turned from the view of the street; they leaned together against the balcony rail, with the room largely in sight from where they stood, but with the Prince and Mrs Verver out of range’ (592). Amerigo and Charlotte, art objects both, commodities bought up by the Verver wealth, sit together in the eastward gloom, in whatever intimacy they have shared throughout, which the narrative has not been able to penetrate and which runs against the current of American capital, the rapid current which carries European art to American City. The interval between the two couples at this close is warped by the turbulence of opposing histories and epistemologies and economies, opposing ways of knowing that are moving under the skin of the polished air, so one can feel the turning, the shifting of the scene, as father and daughter look into the darkening room in which lover and lover sit like undiscovered planets, out of range, beyond our ken. James's precise, delicate attention to the modulations of erotic and filial attachment is laid upon this shifting ground, on the turn of the intellectual plane that Verver finds embalmed in Keats's sonnet. His psychological complexity is powered by it; but while James's later prose tends to be absorbed in these domestic plots, in the rarefied and intensely anatomised relations between father and daughter, between husband and wife, between lover and lover, it is my suggestion here that the turning that is performed in these novels serves a powerful political function, one that is keenly attuned to the demand facing us today, that we fashion a critical response to our own shifting epistemological and geopolitical planes. Jonathan Arac suggests in a 2012 essay that a ‘postcolonial James’ might emerge from a close attention to Verver's reading of Keats. ‘As Adam Verver bears the spoils of culture to American City’, Arac writes, ‘The Golden Bowl modernizes the Roman Westward course of Empire, a trope deeply set in Western culture at large and in American culture particularly’.15 James's novel, for Arac, offers a critique of ‘the westering of culture that follows the westering of Empire’, an extension of the process which ‘brings Homer to England, via Chapman’ – and to trace this critique would be to find in James a version of Edward Said's analysis of the politics of aesthetic form.16 Said, Arac argues, is centrally concerned with the fact that our aesthetic artefacts are products of ‘European political domination’, and so European art is ‘compromised by the imbalance of power from which it arose’.17 The ‘consonance’18 that Arac finds between Said and James derives from his perception that both writers attend to the political power structures that give rise to cultural products, while at the same time investing in the capacity of those products – the art works that proliferate in James's novels, as well as the novels themselves – to exceed their own conditions of possibility. A Saidian James, for Arac, is one who exposes the colonial conditions that give rise to European and American culture, while performing a critique of those conditions, one which is not itself determined by them. This may be so; but if James is to cast any light on the politics of European culture today – or on the ‘peripheral Europes’ to which this special issue is dedicated – then we need to see past the horizon of Said's orientalism. The westward course of Empire that shaped twentieth-century thinking about colonialism, postcolonialism and decolonisation has stalled, in the twenty-first century, with the decline of American hegemony, and the shifting of the geopolitical tectonic plates apparent in the growth of Chinese political and economic power, and latterly in the invasion of Ukraine by Putin's Russia. Dabashi's assertion that Europe has ‘exhausted its epistemological possibilities’ is related to these shifts – and to the waning of the ‘westering’ logic that saw the growth of a global western hegemony as inevitable. The historical momentum, after World War II, towards European integration – towards ‘ever closer union’ – has faltered in the current century, as the political will towards globalisation was weakened by 9/11 and its aftermath, and the economic base of the neoliberal project was weakened by the crash of 2008. The return, across Europe and the west, of populist nationalisms that reject the politics of globalisation (seen perhaps most clearly in Donald Trump's ‘America First’ rhetoric) is a symptom of this failure, as is the UK vote, in 2016, to leave the European Union – a secession whose consequences are still playing out today. It is in this context that we are required to rethink the relation between Europe and its peripheries, and to undertake what Dipesh Chakrabarty has influentially called the ‘provincializing’ of Europe. As Cemil Aydin has suggested, in his 2007 book The Politics of Anti-Westernism in Asia, to understand the meaning of ‘Europe’ today requires us to break the ties that attached Europe to the idea of ‘the west’, and the west to the concept of modernity more generally. The difficulty, for Aydin, is how to ‘refashion Eurocentric modernity’, how to undo the binding in the project of European modernity between colonial violence and philosophical enlightenment, when so many of our conceptual resources for carrying out that work are a legacy of European modernity itself.19 ‘Added to the myth of the homogeneity of Western civilization’, he writes, ‘was the permanent association of the West with both modernity and the international order itself’ – an ‘assumption’ of the constitutive relations between Europe, the west, and modernity, that is ‘a legacy of the nineteenth-century ideology of western supremacy’.20 Chakrabarty's commitment to the provincialising of Europe – the rediscovery that Europe is made of up of local parts and histories that are not affiliated to or consistent with the idea of an overarching Europe (itself a stand-in for western modernity) – is part of this attempt to resee the continent, in the context of larger shifts in the homogeneity and coherence of the west. The process of provincialising Europe, Chakrabarty writes in 2008, enables us to free ourselves from the ‘founding “myth”’ of Europe, the Europe that the history of colonialism ‘assumed’ into existence, and that was then projected as the ‘original home of the modern’.21 ‘To “provincialize” Europe’, he writes, ‘was precisely to find out how and in what sense European ideas that were universal were also, at one and the same time, drawn from very particular intellectual and historical traditions that could not claim any universal validity’.22 Chakrabarty wants to recover ‘parochial’ and particular Europes from the myth of a homogeneous and universalising ‘west’; similarly, Hamid Dabashi sets out to reassess the relation between a mythical Europe and its various others – what he calls Europe's ‘shadows’. ‘To me, today’, Dabashi writes in 2019, ‘Europe, and a fortiori the West, is not a reality sui generis. It is a delusional fantasy, a false consciousness, at the full service of an imperial hegemony. The object is not to run away from it. The object is to dismantle and overcome it.’23 To approach the peripheral in Europe today is to take part in this discussion, this reassessing of the relation between the overarching concept of Europe and of the west, and the specific local instantiations which occur within and outside the realms of that concept. One cannot begin to understand the phenomenon of Brexit – a significant event in the peripheralising of Europe – without reference to this discussion. The legitimacy of the European Union, Dabashi argues, was ‘always contested’ by those who were represented as peripheral partners – ‘from Greece to Spain and Portugal’ – because it was a ‘forced’, manufactured entity designed ‘economically to counterbalance the United States’.24 From this perspective, Brexit serves a useful function in dismantling the concept of European integration, even if it is driven by hateful and reactionary forces. ‘With their xenophobic Brexit’, Dabashi writes, ‘the British delivered the very idea of [the EU] a coup de grâce’.25 One has only to consider the manifest reluctance with which Jeremy Corbyn (leader of the British Labour Party from 2015 to 2020) campaigned for Remain in 2016 – a reluctance that was in keeping with his lifelong Euroscepticism – to see how a strand of the British left resented the European Union as an apparatus of imperialism. But at the same time, how can one welcome a British secession from a political union that, however bound up it is in the globalisation of capital, also enshrines the possibility of a form of community that transcends the boundaries of the nation-state, and that is the closest we have to a guardian of international human rights? How can one welcome it when it is undertaken explicitly to obstruct the ‘free movement of people’ across national borders? How can one welcome it when it is so clearly part of a reactionary lurch to the far right in Europe that endorses every imaginable bigotry and hatred? Dabashi asks himself the rhetorical question, ‘What would the world do without Europe?’, in order to answer that it ‘will reinvent itself’26 (at the risk, of course, that the authors of such reinvention might be the likes of Vladimir Putin, or Xi Jinping, or Donald Trump). It is a mark of the difficulty that Brexit poses to thinkers of the left, though, that many do not share Dabashi's sense that the future of Europe lies outside the borders of the European Union. Ali Smith, for example, in her recent Seasonal Quartet, suggests that it is the European Union itself that is the vehicle for such reinvention. Smith's four novels, Autumn, Winter, Spring, Summer, are a collective act of mourning for the union to which Brexit has delivered a coup de grâce.27 Drawing on a literary and cultural tradition that runs from Ovid to Shakespeare to Dickens to Woolf and Joyce, Smith's quartet seeks to salvage a European tradition – and the products of European cultural history – in order to look to a future that sees the possibility of a European collective preserved, while divested of its will to power. The question, then, that both Smith and Dabashi pose, in different ways, is how and whether we should draw on a cultural archive that has been formed by the history of ‘Europe’, in order to look past the current crisis in European and western democracy. Is it possible to employ the resources of a philosophical tradition, a lyric tradition, a literary tradition, to develop a kind of thinking that can anatomise the crisis that those traditions in part brought about? This is a pressing question for us now; it is the question, too, that provokes Henry James, when he looks through Keats to Chapman, and through Chapman to Homer's western isles. It is the genius of Keats's sonnet, and of Keats's sonnet as James reanimates it, that it allows us to see the terms in which the periphery inhabits the centre, and the centre the periphery. When Cortés's men look at each other with a wild surmise, their wonder arises from their sudden awareness that what for one person is periphery is for another heartland. To come to the Pacific coast, to travel to the edge of the known, is to discover that the world-making, paradigm-building forces that arrange the globe in terms of east and west, near and far, are contingent, and subject to sudden and profound reordering, as these paradigms give way in the face of revelation. The sight of the Pacific coast reshapes the planet, as the sailing of an obscure planet into our ken reshapes the solar system. James's allusions to Keats, in The Ambassadors and in The Golden Bowl, draw on the energy of this revelation, this discovery of a new relation between centre and periphery, just as the historical passage from Europe to the US as the dominant global power is under way. The faint Keatsian echo that we can discern between James's two novels is part of the effect – the sense that the kind of knowing that James is reaching for is achieved not by orienting oneself, by placing oneself securely in one's own ground, but through the realisation that the very possibility of orientation (and occidentation) involves a continual estrangement from that ground, a discovery of oneself not here but elsewhere. Strether's moment of realisation is achieved more fully when it comes into collision with Verver's – as both moments draw their power from their summoning of other displacements: James displaced into Keats; west displaced into east; old displaced into new; Homer displaced into Chapman; Greek displaced into English. James's thinking about the relation between America and Europe at the turn of the twentieth century is conducted through this capacity to unsettle the ground of knowledge, to reproduce the turning – the veering, the stretching, the displacement – that knowing is (a capacity that is Maisie's special gift in What Maisie Knew). His work, for that reason, stands as a testament to the limits of a historical conception both of America and Europe, as the boundaries of the west shift under the pressure of a specific moment in the globalisation of capital. But, at the same time, the turning that James's work performs does not remain bound to its own historical moment, but comes into collision, too, with the moment of reading, with the paradigms of knowing within which a work of literature enters the world afresh, with each new ‘turning of the page of the book of life’.28 To read James now is to read him at a time when, for Dabashi, the ‘faultiness’ of Europe, as ‘the quintessential condition of coloniality’ has been exposed: ‘all its sciences’, he writes, ‘have now ended in the nuclear calamity that hovers over all of us on this earth, all its moral philosophy ended in and at the Holocaust, all its glorious literary masterpieces ended in Donald Trump's tweets’.29 It is to read him at a time when the realignment of Europe and its peripheries has required us to question the legitimacy of the cultural products of Europe and the west – and to ask how western centres of knowledge production, constituted, as Priyamvada Gopal has recently put it, ‘in the crucible of empire’, can be the vehicle of that inquiry.30 James's novels seen in this light – his elaborate, filigreed syntactical constructions – are exemplary of the ‘literary masterpieces’ that lead, inexorably, to the 280-character utterances with which Trump has befouled the discursive environment. It is in this context, in this scene of reading, that James's aesthetics of turning – his capacity to examine and to enact the cultural, political, and aesthetic conditions of knowing – bears a political weight. In placing his actors on the turning ground of a form of knowing that is always outside itself, always situated at the dissolving threshold where new thinking might swim, unbidden, into our ken, James makes of his novels a kind of apparatus for testing the possibility of knowing itself. The artefacts of a cultural heritage that James collects and preserves in his work – as Verver preserves his spoils in American City – are always mobile, always unsettled, always prepared to come into new conjunctions with a kind of knowledge that has not yet been preserved, or assimilated. One of the key forms that this kind of knowing takes in The Ambassadors, and that I offer here by way of a conclusion, is the experience of misrecognition. James's novel is held together by a series of failures of understanding, which occur at each weight-bearing passage in the narrative, and which gather around Strether's repeated failure to recognise a Europeanised Chad, to marshal the conceptual capacity to decode him, despite having known him since he was a child. The first of these moments comes when Strether is walking in Paris, shortly after his arrival in Europe, and he finds himself standing outside Chad's apartment in the Boulevard Malesherbes, looking up at the balcony. As he looks, thinking of Chad, so a lithe figure appears on the balcony, as if in response to his thoughts. ‘A young man’, the narrator says, ‘had come out and looked about him, had lighted a cigarette and tossed the match over, and then, resting on the rail, had given himself up to watching the life below while he smoked’ (TA 89). This scene on the balcony gains some of its arresting power from its precognition of the scene in The Golden Bowl, in which Adam and Maggie lean on their balcony rail, looking into the room in which their spouses are hidden from view. But it also sets up a dynamic of mutual observation that repeats throughout the novel, gaining weight and colour as it does so. Looking down, while Strether looks up, the man sees that Strether is watching him: ‘Strether soon felt himself noticed. The young man began to look at him as in acknowledgement of his being himself in observation’ (89). In this stretched moment, the identity of both men enters into a peculiar kind of suspension. Is the young man on the balcony Chad? In looking down at Strether is Chad recognising his mother's American ambassador, here to take him away, to take him home? Strether thinks that he might be. He ‘wondered at first’, the narrator says, if the man on the balcony ‘were perhaps Chad altered, and then saw that this was asking too much of alteration […] Strether had conceived of Chad as patched, but not beyond recognition’ (89). The phenomenon that had suddenly sat down there with him [Chad himself] was a phenomenon of change so complete that his imagination, which had worked so beforehand, felt itself, in the connexion, without margin or allowance. It had faced every contingency but that Chad should not be Chad, and this was what it now had to face with a mere strained smile and an uncomfortable flush. (117-18) She [Madame de Vionnet] had taken in something as a result of which their course had wavered, and it continued to waver while they just stood off. This little effect was sudden and rapid, so rapid that Strether's sense of it was separate only for an instant from a sharp start of his own. He too had within the minute taken in something, taken in that he knew the lady whose parasol, shifting as if to hide her face, made so fine a pink point in the shining scene. It was too prodigious, a chance in a million, but, if he knew the lady, the gentleman, who still presented his back and kept off, the gentleman, the coatless hero of the idyll, who had responded to her start, was, to match the marvel, none other than Chad. (418–19) ‘Foreign to its familiarities’ Hamid Dabashi writes in Europe and its Shadows, ‘a stranger at home, I stand in front of Europe and ask Europe please to introduce itself’.31 The strangeness of Europe to itself, and to those who stand before it, is a legacy of its colonial history, and a necessary effect of its peripheralisation, the failure of the always spurious forms that made of Europe something homogeneous, and hegemonic. The products of its culture, the literary masterpieces that Dabashi sees as mere precursors to Trump's tweets, serve now not as vessels of knowledge, not as containers of a European heritage or tradition, but as witnesses to the intervals in knowing that are the conditions for the imagining of political community. Madame de Vionnet remarks, at the close of The Ambassadors, on the loss of nationality that has befallen Strether, as a result of his encounter with herself, with Chad, and with Europe. ‘Where’, she asks, ‘is your “home” moreover now – what has become of it?’ (TA 438). What has become, in The Ambassadors, of the sense that your country might be the same as mine, that we might belong, as we look at each other over the wavering gulf that separates us, to a shared community? If James's novel is an extended answer to this question, it is one that suggests both that such community, such mutual recognition, is always in part a fiction, and that it is the purpose of art – its vocation – to occupy the realm that opens when mutual recognition fails, and we feel the weightless turning of a whole intellectual plane.

https://openalex.org/W4365504917,2023,History,"Sutton E. Griggs and Thomas R. Dixon: A Reconstruction Call and ResponseCritics have already paired Sutton E. Griggs with Thomas R. Dixon, not least because of their biographical commonalities. Both men were Southern Baptist preachers turned novelists and took as their subject the racial politics of (post-)Reconstruction. Both wrote romances. Hanna Wallinger, for example, begins with their commonalities before studying how Griggs responded to Dixon's Jim Crow politics in The Hindered Hand (1905).1 But I want to take Wallinger's pairing even further to pose something counter-intuitive. I want to read Dixon through Griggs. The standard reading of the two writers is that Griggs’ 1905 novel explicitly rebuts Dixon, but I argue here that we can also interpret the arch-racist Dixon through the Black activist Griggs. Following Brook Thomas, who frames Albion Tourgée's earlier Reconstruction fiction as preemptively responding to Dixon's later work, I suggest we interpret Dixon's debut novel The Leopard's Spots (1902) as a reply to Griggs’ debut novel Imperium in Imperio (1899), even though Dixon surely never read Griggs.2 But Dixon did seek to counter the prospect of Black freedom promised by Reconstruction and imagined by Griggs. What results from my reading is a better understanding of these authors and texts, the mystifying racial politics of the period, and the discursive power of romance: it provided a literary mode for Black writers and white revanchists alike to contest Reconstruction.Writing in 1899 and after, Griggs and Dixon coincided with what Nancy Glazener terms a “romantic revival,” a “reaction against realism” as the emerging arbiter of literary culture.3 Despite whatever elements of realism either author employed, Griggs and Dixon primarily worked in romance's heightened mode. Yet neither author's first novel seems to belong to a struggle over “literary authority” or the eight-hour day, which Glazener argues drives romance's revival.4 Indeed, because Glazener ignores Reconstruction as historical context for literary trends, including for romance, Griggs and Dixon would appear to have nothing to do with the romantic revival she theorizes. Still, Dixon writes his Klan romances partly in rejection of a multiracial modernity promised by Reconstruction; his romantic whiteness promises an alternative to Black threat in the “real world” of tentative racial democracy. Griggs, meanwhile, belonged to a recognizable cluster of Black romancers who have traditionally fallen outside of assessments of the period as the “rise of realism,” including the early Chesnutt, Hopkins, and Du Bois.5 How then do these two opposing writers, Reconstruction, and romance all fit together?As an alternative to realism, the romantic revival actually served as a terrain for contesting Reconstruction and the period's racial formations. Griggs and Dixon sought not merely to portray things as they were, although in some ways they did that, but to open up discursive space for how things could be different. In that sense, the two writers produced romances with a shared social function but for differing ends—producing, too, what feels like a dialogic call and response. We could even say, contra Glazener, that romance in these years was significantly about Blackness. Consider that if Griggs and Dixon sought to reach large audiences, then choosing the ostensibly “high-brow,” increasingly professional realist mode would only have limited their readerships. The Black romancers who have seemed so marginal to the so-called rise of realism are therefore less out of place than critics long thought because they fit their literary form to the political needs of their present.Scholarship on Griggs’ Imperium in Imperio has hit on this point in focusing on the novel's ambiguous ending: put simply, does it advocate a measured but muscular reformism or a militant proto-Black nationalism? The answer matters less than the question in Griggs’ fiction. As John Ernest has written about The Hindered Hand, Griggs deliberately positions the reader within Black freedom struggle.6 In Imperium in Imperio, Griggs appears to do this through the prospect of race war between the U.S. and the all-Black “nation within a nation,” the Imperium.7 The novel ends with the Imperium's looming insurgency to overthrow the U.S. government and achieve Black civil rights, but just what this means or whether Griggs advocates some form of militancy remains unclear. It is not simply the looming violence that implicates readers, though, asking them to align with militancy or accommodation. Rather the novel invites its Black readership to define itself in wholly new ways, as a new “combination,” to use Griggs’ often repeated word, capable of struggling against Jim Crow.In the long historical tradition of secret societies among free Black people, Griggs’ Imperium fashions a collective racial identity and sense of shared struggle. Joanna Brooks explains that the so-called Prince Hall Freemasons, for instance, appropriated the metaphysical symbolism of traditional masonry to create “a template for race consciousness.”8 The secret Imperium similarly gives formal shape to a diverse and expansive Black community—one no longer significantly defined by chattel slavery—with rituals, taboos, and mutual aid. Despite the looming threat of “race war,” the debate between the Imperium's leaders, Belton and Bernard, comes down to whether to maintain their secrecy. Whereas Belton seeks to announce their existence, Bernard wants to remain hidden. Following Belton's rebuttal of a resolution for war with the U.S., Bernard drafts a “Plan of Action for the Imperium in Imperio” and achieves it by way of backdoor dealing and “a secret, formidable combination” of Imperium senators.9 Above all, Bernard urges the Imperium's congress to maintain secrecy, reflected in his proposal's language: “Quietly purchase all Texas land contiguous to states and territories of the Union. . . . place rapid fire disappearing guns in fortifications. . . . All of this is to be done secretly.”10 The fortification of Texas would coincide with clandestine talks with hostile nations and infiltration of the navy by Black saboteurs, setting the stage for a surprise coup.11The obverse of secrecy is publicity: when debating the Imperium's secrecy, Belton and Bernard are really debating how to define their community, not what that community should do next. Belton and Bernard both seek to determine how the Black Imperium circulates in national discourse and, in turn, how it relates to the racist U.S. Belton's proposal concludes by resolving to temporarily avoid confrontation with whites, while Bernard's concludes by resolving to wage war immediately. Yet the plans begin with entirely contrasting resolutions regarding the Imperium's secrecy.12Imperium in Imperio itself is framed as a part of the debate. As a found manuscript written by the whistle-blower Berl Trout and published by one “Sutton E. Griggs,” the novel supposedly exposes Bernard's war plan in hopes of disarming the Imperium's threat. Even the first words of the text, announcing the Griggs character's prefatory note framing the novel as a found manuscript, are obversely about the problem of secrecy. They read, “To the Public.” From its first page to its last, then, Imperium in Imperio signals its investment in secrecy, publicity, and thus who gets to be in on the secret. The Imperium's members are confronted with the question, what should Black people be? Do they continue trying to be “Americans” or do they commit to becoming a true secret—and separate—society?Because Griggs’ literary method implicates his readers, the concluding dilemma is directed outward to them. In debating the Imperium's secrecy or publicity, Belton and Bernard bring to a head the problem of shared identity inherent to a “nation within a nation” and prompt the audience to answer the question for themselves. Such direct, challenging address surely fits a Black Baptist preacher like Griggs. And his utopian vision justifies situating Griggs within an early tradition of Black speculative fiction, as scholars like M. Giulia Fabi have often done.13 But I also think that the novel's open-ended sense of possibility—to say nothing of its almost gothic secrecy motif—marks the novel as romance. Griggs doesn't aim to faithfully portray the everyday details of Black life so much as to provoke readers to imagine what that life should look like. Romance for Griggs makes the unrealistic imaginable.A few years after Griggs, Dixon writes his own secret rebellion as a way to shore up white supremacy's regime, reacting to the promise of Black political power and equality embodied in Reconstruction. Dixon's first novel, The Leopard's Spots (1902) offers what reads like a reply to Imperium in Imperio, an answer to Griggs’ open-ended question about the racial formation called Blackness. Or we could say it's a response to Griggs’ call, albeit the wrong response. Instead of prompting readers to fashion for themselves a new shared Black identity, Dixon asserts a rigidly hierarchical white one. Griggs attempted to be almost pedagogical in the way he implicated readers, and for that reason his novel leaves us with a sense of multiplicity, possibility, even heterogeneity. Dixon takes a different approach. To call it argumentative misses the point: his argument itself forecloses and constrains multiracial solidarity and a more capacious “white” identity.14Indeed, as the title of chapter XIV of The Leopard's Spots plainly shows, Dixon regarded Reconstruction as a “Negro Uprising,” making the novel fundamentally about what we can call white “counter-uprising” or, given the revolutionary character of Reconstruction, “counter-revolution.” Crucially, however, it's this counter-revolution that produces the white identity that Dixon envisions: it organizes disparate and defeated ex-Confederate revanchists into a unified political force. This occurs in two stages. In a well-known plotline, Dixon first uses a romanticized version of the KKK as the vehicle for secret rebellion.15 Given the KKK's prominence in our own cultural imagination, attention toward the novel has especially centered on this section. But there is a less stylized yet functionally similar white rebellion later on, built not around the KKK but the “Red Shirts.” Appearing at the end of Reconstruction, the Red Shirts acted as a paramilitary wing of the Democrats, enforcing white supremacy through violence and intimidation. Infamously, they helped propel Wade Hampton into office as Governor of South Carolina. The red shirt became “the new badge of uncompromising resistance to radicalism” and “the symbol of a Confederate nationalism which blossomed during the [South Carolina gubernatorial] campaign of 1876.”16 The second half of The Leopard's Spots fictionalizes the historical role of the Red Shirts when Dixon's hero Gaston leads them to physically intimidate Black Republicans and wrestle control of the Democrats from his rivals. The ostensibly secret insurrections represented by the KKK and the Red Shirts forge a triumphant white Southern identity in the face of Black political power.The first iteration of the Ku Klux Klan that existed from 1866 to the mid-1870s reveals much about The Leopard's Spots. Of course critics must always distinguish the historical Klan from the one that Dixon fashions on the page as well as from the Klan operating in the American cultural imagination (although the latter owes much to Dixon).17 Still, this first Klan was the only version of the KKK that had existed by the time that Dixon wrote his novel. According to Elaine Frantz Parsons, the first Klan was less an organization than a “decentralized pattern of violence” given meaning and circulation through discursive practices.18 Yet Dixon appears to offer readers precisely the opposite in the form of a coherent, highly structured secret society that is preceded by a stable white male Southern identity rather than a group that actively creates that identity. I say “appears”: in Dixon's novel, just as in the real world, the KKK and the Red Shirts give shape to a whiteness that is actually amorphous and contingent.19 If slavery could no longer unite conflicting white constituencies, then the vigilante and paramilitary arms of the Democratic party would have to. The counter-revolution of The Leopard's Spots follows this trajectory as the whites of Hambright transform from defeated and disorganized into a victorious political force.20Dixon was as concerned as Griggs with how his readers’ collective racial identity should be defined—and for that reason, his novel likewise constantly toggles between secrecy and publicity. His counter-revolution takes the form of two secret societies, thus granting his revanchists the appearance of a natural, almost elemental white identity with a justified place in the racial order.21 At the same time, readers can discern how that identity must be constantly recreated and then circulated in order to exist. Their secrecy itself has to be public. The KKK insurgency in The Leopard's Spots comes into being not as a spontaneous display of existing white identity but rather as deliberate acts of spectacular racial terror. In this, Dixon's Klan resembles the media-savvy early Klan. Like the Klan's first incarnation, they achieve success primarily through rumor, spectacle, and exaggeration. Which is to say, they lack the very substance that they seek to project.22 Of course their acts of violence are real and severe. Yet their violence achieves a chilling effect beyond the immediate target because that violence is projected outward as spectacle. This is the point of political terror. And because terror contains that discursive element, terror also serves to make relatively small forces appear large, fluid appear solid, and weakness appear as strength. Following their lynching of Tim Shelby, the Klan makes a show of force that stages both their mystery and their spectacle. The procession was a “sight,” one intended to be witnessed and enhanced by the Klan's ritual costume and mystery. News about the procession spreads instantaneously as if everyone had always been in on the secret. The group's victory here lies not in material power but in that they circulate their own mythic image: later reports grossly inflate the KKK's size and strength.23Although less violent or extensively described, Gaston's Red Shirts in the novel's second half function in the same way by giving shape to a reactionary white identity, but that shape is again less substantial than it initially appears. Indeed, the Red Shirts repeat the KKK from Book I as an ostensibly spontaneous, organic uprising. While lacking the same ritualistic secrecy as the Klan, the Red Shirts rely on their own combination of mystery and spectacle.24 The repetition becomes clearest when the Red Shirts hold a procession that mirrors the Klan parade earlier in the novel.25 The Red Shirts repeat the work of the KKK, albeit without living on in the cultural imagination like the KKK has. And like the hoods of the KKK, the uniform of the Red Shirts gives definition to a white identity being built during a period when Black political power was partially and briefly achieved.26 But despite what Dixon or his insurgents would claim, that white identity was always contrived, bestowed with meaning by the very symbols it deployed in order to publicize itself. Murders without a mysterious note signed “K.K.K.” or a lynching remain too obscure to send a public message; a sudden uprising without red shirts is just a riot. Such acts bestow significance to the people who perform them. They organize disparate reactionaries into a coherent, homogenous force. The novel's trajectory in both halves moves from disorganized, disaggregated ex-Confederates to a resurgent whiteness formed under the auspices of the Klan or the Red Shirts. Those groups come to embody the argument implied by the novel's title, which Dixon makes explicit throughout the text. Because “the Ethiopian” cannot “change his skin or the leopard his spots,” whites are under constant threat in the social jungle.27 They must resort to violence in order to survive.Dixon was right that if whites don't actively, violently maintain the racial hierarchy, they will cease to exist as a political category. As both Dixon and Griggs suggest, race is never settled, a given, but rather always up for grabs and waiting to be secured. Which is also to say that with seriousness and effort and luck, we could make our social world differently. In the midst of a romantic reaction against realism, Griggs and Dixon turned to romance for its speculative power. They responded to the contingency of race that Reconstruction underscored, and in romance they found a literary mode that could depict what that contingency might make possible—for good or bad. The tenuous whiteness at the edges of The Leopard's Spots necessarily implies that whiteness, and therefore white supremacy, can be ended. On some level Dixon understood this even though he derived from it the wrong lesson. Perhaps we can instead rethink the tenuousness of whiteness as an open-ended prompt to readers in the style of Sutton E. Griggs.Interpreting Dixon through Griggs, it becomes clear that the latter took the contingency of race as a chance to pose a question that he expected his readers to answer for themselves. Dixon, though, desperately answered that question by reasserting racial hierarchy. Countless writers, radicals, and revolutionaries have answered differently.28 For them, as for Griggs, the contingency of the racial order offers an opportunity. By refusing the wages of whiteness, fleeing its shelter, and betraying its political project, so called white people can help dis-order and ultimately overthrow the racial hierarchy.29 White supremacy began in “Pan-European”30 alliances against indigenous Americans and enslaved Africans; we will end it by building a new, multiracial solidarity, although solidarity always requires real risk and action. Reading Dixon through Griggs reveals what's at stake for both authors—the always available possibility of racial re-formation. And if we creatively misread Dixon in terms of Griggs’ romancing, then we even discover how to make Dixon's worst nightmare a reality.",en

https://openalex.org/W4386841309,2023,History,"Investigating Answerability of LLMs for Long-Form Question AnsweringAs we embark on a new era of LLMs, it becomes increasingly crucial to understand their capabilities, limitations, and differences. Toward making further progress in this direction, we strive to build a deeper understanding of the gaps between massive LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) and smaller yet effective open-source LLMs and their distilled counterparts. To this end, we specifically focus on long-form question answering (LFQA) because it has several practical and impactful applications (e.g., troubleshooting, customer service, etc.) yet is still understudied and challenging for LLMs. We propose a question-generation method from abstractive summaries and show that generating follow-up questions from summaries of long documents can create a challenging setting for LLMs to reason and infer from long contexts. Our experimental results confirm that: (1) our proposed method of generating questions from abstractive summaries pose a challenging setup for LLMs and shows performance gaps between LLMs like ChatGPT and open-source LLMs (Alpaca, Llama) (2) open-source LLMs exhibit decreased reliance on context for generated questions from the original document, but their generation capabilities drop significantly on generated questions from summaries -- especially for longer contexts (>1024 tokens)",en

Here, the authors present a rare sixteenth-century context, dating to a time when European cities contended with repeat epidemics and implemented measures to control the spread of disease. A contextual approach to the assemblage leads to its identification as a ‘medical dump’ of clinical equipment, including glass urine flasks and ‘single-serve’ ceramics, many of the latter specifically produced for the Ospedale dei Fornari. Drawing on Renaissance medical treatises, the authors argue that this material represents the disposal of potentially infected objects, shedding light on urban waste-management practices.",en
